His old iPod was so nasty sticky. So he saved up for a new iPod and he bought a white one. So we found the white case. It's great. Does well in an 11 yr old pocket, and at the big brother's baseball games!  Super product and arrived before expected delivery date.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004763IJ8" id="B004763IJ8-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-13:</strong> I bought this for my son to use.

This case is cheaper that a $1 burger from McDonalds! The case does cover up all ports and buttons so they are accessible. This case was chipping the very next day I received it! This case is very cheap quality and should be avoided at all costs!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004763IJ8" id="B004763IJ8-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-12-04:</strong> This is a good case if you dont ever plan to use it in a place with any dirt or dust. It does get dirty easily. Don't get this if you plan to remove the case more then once per week. It breaks very easily. Good case if you accidentally drop it. It does not come off easily.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004763IJ8" id="B004763IJ8-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-02:</strong> I bought this case for my boyfriend and he loves it!

Definitely buy this item, it's nice and DOES protect, however it's hard to take off.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004763IJ8" id="B004763IJ8-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-24:</strong> I was rather pleased in the beginning with the case, the feel makes the ipod very comfortable. I had no problem with any ports being blocked and such. The installation took some work, but worked out in the end. However...the problem I ran into was that...I cannot take off the case without breaking it. I've been trying to take off the case for the past hour, and I cannot get it off. I do not want to end up breaking it, and wasting the money I paid on this product. Overall, it ruined everything else for me. I'm not at all pleased with this problem.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004763IJ8" id="B004763IJ8-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-26:</strong> It's the best protection for your iPod Touch and weightless option, this fit perfectly in your iPod Touch 4 model</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004763IJ8" id="B004763IJ8-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-12-24:</strong> This case is so good i would pay 20 for this its a very great case and does not cover up any over your cameras and sync slot or headphone jack all the buttons are still easily accesible amazing case BUY IT!! :)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004763IJ8" id="B004763IJ8-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-10-18:</strong> I ordered this cover for my iPod touch on Saturday night and received it on Tuesday.

But, she put her stickers on it, covered it with packing tape, and now she has a one of a kind case that she's thrilled with.  With the low price, she could make a new one when the stickers and tape starts peeling, but so far she's very happy with her case.

I've gotten 3 of these, and they all work great!  The flatness of the cable actually does seem to help them from being tangled, and definitely helps in the untangling when the 3 of them get bunched up.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GCFSLFS" id="B00GCFSLFS-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-01:</strong> Sufficiently thin to allow me to close the drawer of my nightstand which has the power strip in it. It's a little bright for my tastes, but a quick application of paint-pen fixed that right up. They do advertise that they have a dimmer version, but I couldn't find it in the longer length. USB shroud at the phone-end is sufficiently small enough to fit through the opening on my phone's case (Spigen Neo Hybrid on Galaxy S4)Got a second one for the girlfriend's side of the bed, and now she wants more for travelling too.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GCFSLFS" id="B00GCFSLFS-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-20:</strong> I read the reviews and was worried the light would be too much considering how I am not a heavy sleeper, and I love it. The light at the end is super dim, so when you open your eyes in the middle of the night, you'll only see a small dot. But when you need to connect the port to your phone, its SUPER helpful. I applied this item with the &#34;OMNI LED Light up Transparent Dual USB Port 3.1 AMP AC Travel Home Wall Charger Power Adapter (CLEAR)&#34; and it charged my phone SUPER fast. I mean, it usually takes 2-3 hours to charge my Samsung Galaxy S3, but this cord powered with the adapter is a match made in heaven. DEFF will be buying again. And the length? Its SOOO much more than I need, which is exactly what I need</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GCFSLFS" id="B00GCFSLFS-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-21:</strong> I bought these and I love them!  So much better than the shorter cords that comes with phones.

Maybe catching up on the news, reading a book, doing some social media, whatever. In the bedroom we have some specific challenges that this cord overcomes brilliantly. The first issue is length. At just about ten feet, this cable will not fall short and cause you to have to plug your cord back into the wall or whatever. Ten feet is a ton of slack. The second issue at ten feet would be tangles. I guess the flat design of the cable causes it to not tangle! It's awesome that way! And the third issue is that at night it is hard to see if the micro usb is going in the right way. With this thing, it's lit up! It is amazingly obvious how the micro usb fits into the phone. First try every time!So I got two of these, one for my wife, and one for me. I would say that the LED on this thing is as bright as an LED Nightlight. Not super bright, but bright enough that a dark room will be substantially brighter with one of these rolling. If you are someone that has to have complete darkness while sleeping, this might not be the cable for you.But as for me? I love it. Best cable I have ever had. Now I hope it just holds up as I just got it a week ago.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GCFSLFS" id="B00GCFSLFS-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-20:</strong> works well easy to find in a dark room.

Don't fool yourself into thinking you need to spend more money because you don't. These work great and have a nice smooth feel just like the original glass. They come with a protective film with pull tabs on both sides making them easy to apply. Leaves no bubbles if done correctly and look terrific. Several of my friends have asked me what brand I bought so they can get the same for their phones. Tip - Put a small piece of masking tape across one corner of your screen to make the protector easy to lift if you don't get it right the first time. Then when you're satisfied just pull the tape away from under the screen. Works great.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00CMRCEN0', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00CMRCEN0', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00GXE57SM</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00GXE57SM</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GXE57SM" id="B00GXE57SM-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-31:</strong> Nice color and design.

It has a plastic case inside that actually covers the entire phone so the only part of your phone that is uncovered are the buttons, charging port, jack and speakers. This case will protect your phone from almost anything since it literally covers your entire phone. I know I've said that 3 times already but it's true. My cards fits perfectly in the card slots and it just has a nice sleek executive look to it.The screen protector is crap.

The black part is rubber that covers the two pieces once snapped together. There is a small plastic kick-stand that comes out of the back, but is honestly a little flimsy, so you do have to be careful. Also, its not very wide, so the phone can teeter a little on it.Headphone jacks and the chargers that come with this phone fit perfectly. (Please note: I also have an LG charger that is much fatter on the end and does not fit through the cut-out holes).All of the opening in the case were accurately placed.Overall, the case is very sturdy, and is perfect for what a case needs to do.

You can pivot the belt clip. You can access the s-pen easily without worrying about it falling out (the holster has a notch which covers the pen). And the whole thing is amply minimal to keep your already-gigantic phone from becoming truly behemoth.EDIT: After a bit of use, I have noticed that holster isn't terribly secure. Since the phone slides easily into the holster, occasionally I will find that the phone has slid partially out of the holster.

When I purchased the GN2, I wanted something very similar. I couldn't find a case out there that I liked. Came across this item and so far it works. I have a slim case already on my phone and it's not an issue to use with the belt clip case. It's light and durable and clips easily on your pants waist or even a pocket. Because of the size of the phone it wasn't feasible to hang on the front of my pants. I literally clipped it to my back pocket and had my walk in the park. I actually faced the phone inward on the case to protect the face of the phone. I wasn't concerned about answering a call because I can easily slide it out but the case is light enough to be used while on a call. Not sure I will use the stylus that came with it or the secondary case for the kick stand. I could in the future maybe. The style is simple enough that being a woman and marginally concerned about it looking feminine, not an issue. It's a belt clip case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AHQC88O" id="B00AHQC88O-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-02:</strong> nice case, my only reason for it not getting 5 stars is the rubber inner case is just too flimsy.  needs to be a bit more durable.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AHQC88O" id="B00AHQC88O-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-03:</strong> This case was a perfect fit for our Note II, great protection for your device + looks great, clip is sturdy.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00AHQC88O', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00AHQC88O', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B008AYEN4W</h2>    <p class="price"> $B008AYEN4W</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008AYEN4W" id="B008AYEN4W-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-19:</strong> Very stylish looking case.

First, it doesn't quite wrap all the way around the edge - the metal trim on the front of the phone is visible to varying degrees around the edge of the case when it's on the phone. Second, it's a full-form case - meaning that there aren't cut-outs for the power and volume +/- buttons...I've had cases like this before and it's been fine but this one seems to be made so thick it interferes with your ability to push the buttons.The back looks nice and the cut-outs for the speaker/camera/flash are well-positioned but the rest of it is a deal-breaker.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008AYEN4W" id="B008AYEN4W-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-09-25:</strong> Got this case on time.

The case buttons don't seem to line up correctly with the phone's physical buttons.  You no longer get a clicking sensation when pressing the power button.  You have to press relatively hard to get the power button to turn the screen on/off.Aside from that, the case looks really nice and has a good grip.I'm on the fence as to whether I want to keep this case and tolerate the poor button feel.  The Speck candyshell buttons work MUCH better, but it scuffs really easily and already looks like crap after 1 month...</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B008AYEN4W', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B008AYEN4W', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00A4L4E9I</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00A4L4E9I</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A4L4E9I" id="B00A4L4E9I-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-28:</strong> Great case.

Now you must be wondering which case is best for it. There are several good options: Otterbox, Incipio, and Diztrnoic cases. I have Incipio already (HT-316 Dual Pro) and I love it a lot. I also know that Otterbox makes great cases as well. But these are somewhat pricey. So what is a happy medium? Diztronic case for your HTC 8X.1. The case is made out of TPU - stronger than silicon while flexible, and more shock absorbent than Polycarbonate plastics. This is very strong and sturdy case. TPU is also known for oil resistant. All in all, TPU is a great material for your phone.2. The case is slim, thin, and light. My Incipio case is great, but because it has two layers of protection(silicon lining inside and polycarbonate shell outside), it is somewhat bulkier and heavier than Diztronic case. You could feel the difference when you hold your phone.3. The case is tight fit. Other reviewers have said it is difficult to put on (this is so, because of the material and for great fit with the phone). Because it is a tight fit, the phone and the case feel like one object!4. The case is easy to handle. My Incipio case is somewhat slippery, but Diztronic case is not, yet easy to take it out from your pocket.5. All the buttons are well covered - except for the power button. All ports are easily accessible as well.So if you are looking for a great case with a great price, then Diztronic case is your best bet! I love mine! Highly, highly recommended!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A4L4E9I" id="B00A4L4E9I-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-19:</strong> I was looking for a case for the new HTC Windows Phone 8X.

"Now your voice sounds muffled", he said, "and I hear that TV now loud and clear".I have other stories like this.  Walking down a busy noisy street - the Etymonic makes my voice clear and there is no noise of traffic or wind.

Sound is good.  You can speak at a normal volume level and you will be heard.  I don't use it outside though.  The earplug does give you a sense of being underwater, the way it blocks your whole ear canal.  But that's how it blocks out noise.  I do think for the money there should be some sort of volume/mute control on the cable.  But, I knew there wasn't when I bought it.  My only complaint is that it comes with a case, yet the headset doesn't fit in it without bending the microphone stalk and I'm not comfortable doing that.  It's sensitive equipment, with a filter in the earpiece that I know I'll have to change eventually hence the included tool for same, then it shouldn't be left in the open to collect dust.  Why not give a case that accomodates it and its accessories?UPDATE 4/30/08:  After months of using this headset, I have to say I find it mildly annoying.  You feel like you're hearing something under water, because the thing is so jammed in your ear (it's a little bit violating...).  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone shopping for a headset.  I really bought it because it was so hard to find a headset compatible with my AT&T; 8525.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0001YX9ZI" id="B0001YX9ZI-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-03-08:</strong> The sound of this headset is excellent, as advertised.  The trouble is in getting it to stay in place when I move around.  I'm not talking about playing tennis here, I'm talking about driving the car, and having the boom slowly swing downwards away from my mouth.  The ear plug stays in place, and I can still hear, but the boom swings downward from in front of my mouth (pulled by gravity) and then the person I'm talking with can't hear me so well.  The only thing that works for me in this regard is Plantronics, the one the hooks behind your ear lobe, but that one is not noise-canceling, so I can't hear as well when the wind noise gets high in the car.  The ones that hook over my ear hurt me, and the ones that just plug into my ear usually fall out.  This one is better in that it stays in my ear, but having the boom pivot away from my mouth is a real problem.  I tried bending it so it hangs down from my ear and then swings forward to my mouth, but the center of gravity still tries to swing to the lowest point, so I'd not a boom twice as long as this for that plan to really work.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0001YX9ZI" id="B0001YX9ZI-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2008-05-06:</strong> As you can see by the picture, this device has merely an ear canal insert and the microphone and cord just dangle.  It feels a little awkward to me, although if you're not moving it does stay in as long as you've "pulled your ear back" while inserting it, which creates a clamp effect between your ear canal and the rubber insert.  The earset itself is light enough to work this way.  The problem is the cable, which drags, gets bumped by clothing, etc, and jiggles things.  You have to clip the cable to your collar for sure, it's not optional like with over-the-ear headsets.  It comes with a little Y-shaped adapter which lets you use it with SKYPE or other PC-based systems.  Interestingly, while this works fine, the earset has a little whistle-y electronic noise with Etymotic that I don't hear (no matter how close I listen) with some other earsets I have.  It's not noticeable once a conversation starts. Overall, for most use, I don't find it's much better than a couple $7 dollar over-the-ear earsets Radio Shack used to stock (no longer do).  It may be, as someone reported, it's way better for wind noise, I haven't tried that.  It comes with a couple fluffy black sponge wind masks for the mike bulb.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0001YX9ZI" id="B0001YX9ZI-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-05-29:</strong> This is by far the best wired or wireless headset I've ever used (over a dozen). It comes with a the headset, a medium length cord with 2.5mm plug, a small and large windscreen, and a 2.5mm-line in/ line out adapter for your PC and a carry case, plus 3 different sized earplugs and a cleaning tool. I use it for 4-5 hrs per day on averagePros:Very high quality speaker. Like high quality headphones, if you phone has good signal it sounds great, but you'll hear lots of distortion with a poor signal. I use it with a blackberry 9650 and a femtocell - it is sounds as good as a high quality landline. It didn't sound as good with HTC and Samsung (CDMA) phones, but this is indicative of the quality of the phone's voice circuitry.Great noise cancelling microphone - with the windscreen on, you can use it outdoors even in strong wind (20 mph). Background noise is very muted and callers are usually amazed that I am on a cell.Works with glasses and hats - unit is held in place by friction. It's light enough so it works well. This makes it great for outdoor activities.Cord is perfect length and is designed to work with the phone on a belt clip or pants pocket. Form factor is great and it takes little space.Surprisingly, friction alone holds the unit in place. It is pretty durable too (sitting on it or dropping it)Cheap - for $35, it performs much better than the Jawbone/Plantronics bluetooth variety without the radiation risk and outperforms high end corded headsets too (call center sets, theBoom)Cons:2.5mm plug. Every modern smartphone uses 3.5mm. Time for an update.Uncomfortable and itchy after extended (4-5 hrs) use.

This is it.On my motorcycle you can't hear the engine, and with the windscreen it is good at low speeds (sans windshield - at 30 mph the smaller windscreen starts letting noise through.  You can't hear my stereo blaring.  I would say it is just slightly less able than the BlueParrot - but that might be because the boom doesn't quite reach the corner of my mouth.  But I only have problems if the noise is coming in at just the right angle.It has an isolating insert so it blocks out external noise (you might need an earplug for the other ear in really noisy environments).A few nits:They should have cases for the windscreens - they tend to get squished.  A stereo or dual mono version would be welcome.  The boom could be a bit longer.Only negative is they don't include an iPod/Blackberry/(some)Android 4 conductor 3.5mm adapter, but I already have several.  They have a VoIP adapter.So maybe not perfect, but this is way beyond all the other "handsfree" wired headsets I have used, and it isn't that expensive for what it does.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B0001YX9ZI', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B0001YX9ZI', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00G4HHOIY</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00G4HHOIY</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00G4HHOIY" id="B00G4HHOIY-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-01:</strong> Tech inside your phone is improving on a minute by minute basis.

In short, not even worth the $2, I have got better covers from amazon and ebay at this price, stay away.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0042EBDWE" id="B0042EBDWE-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-29:</strong> Good case overall, but the silicon slides off too easy but it slings back into place, worth the price though really cheap, shipping took a while but i could deal with it</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0042EBDWE" id="B0042EBDWE-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-26:</strong> this case was for my dad he always likes very thing black and dont like to spend money just get things for cheap</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0042EBDWE" id="B0042EBDWE-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-15:</strong> Got this for my dad and he has no complaints.

It is barely wide enough to cover my phone. The whole thing feel flimsy and looks cheap.My phone snaps into the frame just fine. The problem comes when I need to remove it to place in a charging or playback cradle. If all I wanted to do was leave my phone in the case all the time and charge it with a cable this would be fine.  Unfortunately, that's not all I want to do.  It is extremely difficult to remove and it's a question of which would break first, the case or my phone. Frankly, I don't plan in using it long enough to find out.The only good thing is that for the price I don't mind so much tossing it in the trash.Bottom line, if you're looking for an inexpensive leather case, don't care about its quality, and don't plan on removing your phone then this might be right for you. Otherwise, you may want to look elsewhere.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052CHLPI" id="B0052CHLPI-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-03:</strong> Works great thanksApple Iphone 3G Replacement Front Glass and Digitizer - Repair your...Apple Iphone 3G Replacement Front Glass and Digitizer - Repair your...</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052CHLPI" id="B0052CHLPI-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-11-04:</strong> For the price this is a good case.

I have anAnker SlimTalk 3200mAh Battery Charger, which is slender and great for keeping my phone alive during the day, but even it can't keep my phone charged for more than one day, which is a problem for long trips. This EC TECHNOLOGY charger is a lifesaver, though I do want to note that it has a couple of quirks to be aware of.1: Size. This is a pretty big charger. You wouldn't want to put it in most purses, though it would be at home in a large laptop bag or roomy day-bag. Check the product dimensions before you order and make sure that your use-case for this backup can withstand the extra weight. I think it's a good size for a travel charger, but your mileage will vary.2: Power Button. The one thing I don't really care for about this battery is that it's not "plug-and-go", you actually have to press a power button after you hook up your phone/tablet but before the battery will start charging it. (The button is easy to press with the ball of your finger.) If you're used to plug-and-charge batteries, this can take some getting used to; one time I plugged in my phone and grabbed it before heading out only to realize that I'd forgotten to turn the battery on and my phone was near-dead.3: Overcharging. The other quirk is that the battery turns itself OFF when the phones/tablets attached to it are fully charged. Now, I get that overcharging a device is a concern for certain situations, but if you have a device that draws a lot of charge while idle (which my older model phone does), then this means that an overnight charge on this battery will go like this: your phone will charge up to 100% at or around midnight, the battery will switch off, and then your phone will seep charge for the rest of the night and you'll wake up to a dead phone. Mmph. This is why I say I wouldn't use this charger for overnight charges -- unless your device doesn't pull a lot of idle charge or if you've switched it off ahead of time.4: Dual Output. This battery charges two devices via USB. There's an "output 1" and an "output 2" slot, and one time it seemed like the Output 2 slot wasn't working unless the Output 1 had something charging on it. That seemed like a very strange design decision, though, so I tried it again later and it was fine. I'm 99% sure that the problem in that case was that I hadn't plugged the cord into my device firmly enough, so once again the larger point here is to MAKE SURE your device is charging before you walk away. (See point #2.) Obviously this is true for any battery backup device.5: Display. The visual display is great in that it tells you (a) that the battery charger is on and charging and (b) precisely how much charge is left (not in 0/25/50/75/100 increments like my Ankar does, but rather in actual "79%" numbers), but it's also fairly bright. If you flip the battery over onto its front, there isn't much light-seepage.6: Performance. I'm actually really impressed with the speed of charge on this battery. My benchmark tool for these things is the Kairosoft games on the Google Market -- I love them, but they suck the battery dry like an expensive vacuum cleaner. I've found that I can plug my Samsung Skyrocket phone into the charger while it plays audio non-stop and plug my Samsung Note 8.0 into the charger while it plays a Kairosoft game, and the charger will still manage to (barely) keep up and keep inching both devices towards a net positive charge gain. That's a REALLY impressive charging speed, given that I've actually seen a Kariosoft game drain one of my devices while on a wall plug before. Of course, if you want a faster charge-up on this (or any) battery backup, the best thing to do is stop using your device, but it's nice to know that you still can if you need/want to.7: Storage. The sheer amount of charge in this device is also impressive -- I've had my phone on the charger with non-stop audio going for 8+ hours, and the tablet with a game going for 4-5 hours throughout that, and STILL have not seen the charger dip below 60%. I think I could probably get two full days of heavy use (or three days of light use) on this without charging the battery, but haven't had a chance to test that yet.8: Accessories. Final point, this battery backup comes with its own cord and a variety of plug-heads to swap out. I've only used it with USB-to-microUSB devices (and the battery itself charges via USB-to-microUSB into a USB wall plug we've installed in our home), but it's nice to have the heads to swap out if anyone drops by with an iPhone in dire need of charging.Bottom-line, this is a great travel charger once you get the hang of using it, if you don't mind the added weight, and if you can either turn your phone off at night or have some other solution for night-charging (or if your phone idles extremely efficiently). I highly recommend it and I'm glad that I had the opportunity to review it.NOTE: This review is based on a free review copy of this product.~ Ana Mardoll</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CAMCCLQ" id="B00CAMCCLQ-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-17:</strong> We fly from country to country & often.

First of all, I need to say that I've only charged this battery pack two times since I received it, I used it moderately.The battery pack holds 16,800mah (advertised), but it truly holds around 10,000 to 11,000mah. The conversion processes consume some amount of that 16,800mah. Still, it's a pretty good bang for your buck. Each charge with my Nexus 4 takes around 9% of the battery. This battery pack has a LCD display which displays the battery percentage, unlike other portable batteries which only have 4 leds that represent 25% of charge. The button to turn on the battery is easy to press and when pressed, the display turns on for 15 seconds, during which you can connect the devices to charge. When charging, the LCD stays lit, some people might dislike this, but to me, it doesn't matter since I always have it on my backpack. The battery itself is has a nice weight to it, and I don't suggest having this in a purse.When the battery is completely drained and you press the ON button, the display will show 0% and it will quickly turn off. You can charge this with a micro usb, but the package does not come with a wall adapter. The instruction manual suggests a 1A charger, but I use a 2.1A charger and it takes around 13 hours to fully charge.The one really bad thing I found about this portable battery is that every time it reaches around 30% of energy remaining and I charge my phone, it immeadiately goes down to 0%. I do not know why this happens, but I'll keep testing the battery and update this review if I figure out what is causing this anomaly. Thank you for taking your time to ready my review, please feel free to ask any question and I'll answer as soon as I can.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CAMCCLQ" id="B00CAMCCLQ-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-08:</strong> *Disclosure: I was contacted by EC Technology and given a sample of this product specifically for the purpose of reviewing it.*Test devices:Google Nexus 7HTC OneHTC EVO 4G LTESamsung Galaxy NexusSamsung Galaxy S2Samsung Galaxy S3Samsung Galaxy S4Kindle Fire HD 7"Battery packs come in all shapes, sizes, and capacities.  This one from EC Technology is among the highest capacities available, and it comes dressed like it means business.  The gloss black plastic body is accented with a brushed metal cover on the front, as well as a small LCD screen for viewing how much of its charge is left.  It's a solid and hefty feeling device, one that could easily be used to club someone with, though the plastic housing picks up fingerprints and scratches rapidly.The kit comes with two sets of cables so that the owner can make use of both of the battery pack's USB ports at the same time.  A good thing too, for reasons I'll get to later.  Given the price range the pack sits in, I was a little surprised that it didn't include an AC charger or something to keep all the bits in like some of EC Technology's cheaper models.  The included manual is easy to read, and there is even a EC Technology branded bookmark tossed in there as a little bonus item.So, what can we do with all that power?  Charge tons of devices of course!  One could also use it as an external battery pack if their USB charged device wasn't going to be moving around too much.  And this is where the little issue about the USB ports comes in.  One is a 2A, the other a 1A, or, if both are used at the same time, the 3A total output is spliced between them.  After doing a lot of testing, I discovered something odd in the charge rates for single USB device charging.  None of the devices seemed to charge at the same rate as they would with a 2A AC charger.  Digging in a little, I found that my devices were reporting back as being charged from USB, which is limited to 1A.  This is a change from the other battery packs with 2A USB ports that I've used/reviewed.  Fussing about, I found the culprit - it's the cables.  To aid in my testing, I was using a known good USB cable instead of the supplied cables, just as I usually do.  Turns out, the EC Technology unit isn't cool with this.  It wants its own cables, and not using them drops the charge rate down to 1A.  I tried two difference cables and two different battery packs to verify.  So, something internal to the battery pack isn't allowing the use of a common cable.  For that, one star was lost.  Sorry guys, but one can't be reliant on a single source for a common cable.Anyhow, in usage, the unit worked great.  Refilling my phone from 20% for 8 days straight and the battery pack is still over 50% full.  I was also able to fully charge up 6 of my devices on a single full charge of the battery pack.  That's pretty handy, especially in a group setting, long distance travel, or simply wanting to run a USB device for an extended amount of time (e.g. lamp, fan, speakers).  While its size may not be convenient for every application where a portable battery pack could do some good, I think it's a solid purchase.  Oh yeah, and don't lose the cables.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CAMCCLQ" id="B00CAMCCLQ-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-15:</strong> My past review stated it took forever and a day to charge.

It includes a feature I wish every single battery sold had, a % charge number.The battery is rated at 16,800mAh with two USB outputs. I have an iPad 1 and an iPhone 4. The battery was able to charge my iPad from zero (or whatever the battery level is when the iPad turns itself off), an additional 25% to that iPad and two full iPhone charges. That is about the equivalent of 10,000mAh - or a good solid high percentage of the rated capacity. In fact the battery pack probably have the rated capacity; there are inefficiencies of charging as a battery is topped off the last 10% (that happened in three charge cycles).Bottom line, the battery capacity is fantastic in this unit for the price - at around $40 there isn't a much better deal for a battery this big. The battery can easily extend the iPad battery 1.5 times. That's pretty darn impressive. I would expect about 8 or 9 charges for an iPhone.The great news, the two USB ports output high current and will charge devices at their high charge rate. I love that; so many batteries don't do this, they typically work at the medium charge rate level.The big bonus on this unit there is a small number in the LCD window that shows the percentage of battery charge left. In my experience, above 40% was incredibly accurate. At about 25% the battery could die out any moment. Most batteries have a little set of LED's or bars to show roughly how much charge is left, they are really horrible to judge true charge level. This unit includes a quick glance set of bars in the display.I actually love just about everything on this battery. The power switch is recessed just enough that the battery won't start inadvertently; you have to deliberately press the button to turn on the unit to start charging. When the battery has some charge, it will do flow through charging when it is plugged in. This means the battery can be plugged into an AC adapter or a computer, and the device can be plugged into the battery and both will charge at the same time. This is a great feature for overnight charging. When the battery is at 0%, flow through does not work.This is a nice looking block. The brushed aluminum front is a nice touch in not showing fingerprints. The unit does not come with an AC adapter. The battery can be charged in most USB ports and with most USB AC adapters. It is probably wise to use the higher power AC adapters like that supplied with an iPad. The minuscule iPhone adapter works, but it takes a long time. The battery is not fast to charge, I've left it charge overnight from 0% left. By morning it is at 100%. The charging port is a standard micro USB connector. I don't like those personally, however it is the de facto standard everybody uses now, so I can't argue anymore.The unit does not include an LED flashlight - I think the product description suggests it does. The LCD on the front panel is always lit up blue whenever the unit is on and charging a device.For the price, this can't be beat. I've tested a lot of battery packs and this one is the first to have a % charge remaining in the display. I love that feature. This is a large capacity battery and as such they are usually kind of big and heavy. This one is no different. The package is slim and good looking, but it is still a chunk. It is roughly one and a quarter iPhones long, about 10% wider than an iPhone, and the thickness of two iPhones stacked up.I was provided a review sample.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CAMCCLQ" id="B00CAMCCLQ-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-30:</strong> the good things:- massive capacity!

It works wonderfully keeping the kids occupied and quiet... until the battery dies. Then the heat is on! Can we have a Sprite? Can I use your phone? What are you reading? Where are the headphones? Are we there yet? Where are we going? I'm hungry! etc.With this unit, we were able to keep the kids flinging birds at pigs for twice as long! After we wore down the iPad, the kids took a nap while it charged and then they were back in business.Now that you know how I used it, let me give you some details.1. Read the dimensions carefully. It's a bit bigger than I expected. Its roughly the size of two decks of cards and a tad thicker. It's also pretty heavy as well, but none of this mattered for my use. I'd carry a car battery if it meant that I could keep my kids happy on a plane.2. The LCD readout is great. I have other (smaller) chargers and I never know what's going on with them. It's nice to see what percentage this one is at, and also watch it dump into the iPad. Seeing it count down from 100% is a great visual to see that it's working and how fast it's going. My kids liked seeing it as well because they could estimate how much time was left until "game time!"All in all, I think this device is a lifesaver. I will definitely have it with me on every plane trip from here on out.[product was provided by manufacturer for review]</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CAMCCLQ" id="B00CAMCCLQ-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-31:</strong> While the EC Technology Ultra-High Density External Battery is very heavy and larger than I expected it does a great job of charging my devices several times between charges.

A true necessity for keeping your gadgets powered by road, air, or wherever work or personal life may take you, that wall outlets never seem to be. I'm extremely impressed with theEC TECHNOLOGY Dual USB Output 16800mAh Power Bankfor so many great reasons.After doing some research on Amazon, this appears to be one of the first power banks available to feature an LCD display that gives you an accurate numerical percentage of the power supply left in the power bank.  This feature also makes it really easy to confirm the power bank is accepting a charge and producing charges.This unit is designed with two (2) USB charging ports, one rated 1A and the other 2.1A.  This is perfect for charging both a Smartphone and tablet at the same time.  This unit features 16800mAh of power; some examples of  how much power that actually is: it's enough power to charge popular tablets like the Nexus 7 or Kindle Fire HD (average 4400mAh battery) three or more full charges, and most Smartphones (average 2200mAh battery) five or more full charges.  This power bank is capable of giving the iPad 4 (with a huge 11,560mAh battery) a full charge or more.  If your device does not use any of the included tips and can charge via USB, you may use your own USB charging cable with this power bank.  This power bank is rechargeable with a Micro-B USB cable and can be charged via computer or with your own provided USB wall adapter (commonly, one used with smartphones or tablets).In the box you will find:~The EC Technology 16800mAh Power bank~One (1) 6" USB charging cable for use with included tips~One (1) 25" USB charging cable for use with included tips~Four (4) charging tips (Mini-B, 30-pin Apple, PSP, Micro-B)~User GuideThe design of this unit is very sleek with a brushed metal look on the front.  However, the unit does appear to look like a `brick' and measures 6.5"L x 2.75"W x 0.75H.  The consideration to bear in mind though, when a power bank gets to be over 10,000mAh in capacity, the units physical size can appear more `bulky'.  It's often a tradeoff for having more portable power immediately at your disposal. In terms of actual weight, the unit does weigh less than 1lb and would be perfect for a computer bag or day bag.Overall, I really like theEC TECHNOLOGY Dual USB Output 16800mAh Power Bank.  It has a smart display system and really packs a tremendous amount of power.  Perfect for recharging Smartphones and tablets or most any other devices that charge via USB; this is a must have for the gadget obsessed.Disclosure: I received a sample product from the manufacturer for the purposes of providing this review.

It has square edges and brushed metal accents. I was also taken aback at how big and heavy it was. I was thinking, really, there are more compact and sleek designs than this. But then, I started charging things. I used it exclusively to charge my Droid Incredible 4G LTE for a week. And the battery pack was still at 75% power. Wow. That would have drained most battery packs to nothing. I used it to charge a Kindle fire, same slow drain with little impact on the amount of juice left in my heavy metal brick. It did not charge my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet.It comes with two cables, one shorter, one longer and four plugs including micro USB, mini USB, iPod (30-pin) and PSP. Or you can use your own USB device cable.What I like: HUGE power capacity. Love the battery remaining percentage. It gives you a clear indication of how much battery is left. It charges two devices at a time.What I don't like: it is heavy and big. I would be a lot to take for a long airplane trip although the benefit is that you don't have to carry a couple of smaller banks. It does not have a carry case to keep all the parts together. The box says it has a built-in flashlight but it does not have one. However, I couldn't imagine carrying this around to use as a flashlight.For the price, this beast packs a ton of power. If you need longevity, this is the device to go with. If you want portability and moderate use, there are other smaller power-banks.I was provided a unit for evaluation and an honest review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CAMCCLQ" id="B00CAMCCLQ-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-17:</strong> I bought this bcuz the 14000 ma was flimsy and refused to recharge b4 the charging port broke completely.

The battery arrived the day before my trip from ATL to Ft Meyers FL exactly as advertised.  It arrived with 3 of 4 bars showing charged.  When we hit the road that morning I decided to see how long it could last and plugged my wife's HTC One and my GS3 into the 2 ports.  I turned on the GPS in the GS3 and my wifes phone was responsible for streaming Pandora the entire trip.  With stops for food and gas we traveled for about 12 hours.  When we arrived at our hotel the battery reported only being half full (2 of 4 lights).  The battery was cool to the touch despite being locked in my center console the entire trip.  The flash light was plenty bright enough to find the dropped lip balm under the car during dusk.  All in all great battery.-Pros-Really long life. its extra nice to not have to worry about power plugs on transit or when out and about around town.Flash light is bright.  Like really bright.2 power portsMicro USB port chargeable.  I have dozens of those cables and chargers around my house so it is easy to fill it back upRather compact for the charge its holding.  Think 3 six inch phablets stacked together.-Cons-The usb ports aren't &#34;smart&#34;.  Won't charge my work Blackberry nor my usb charged ASUS T100TA while they are powered on.It'd be nice if there was a 9v or 12v rapid charge plug as well.  Waiting upwards of 24 hours for a fully depleted pack to be recharged to full again is too long. For those wondering expect about 8 hours per 25% dot on the indicatorOnly 4 charge lights to tell how much juice is there.  With it taking so long to fill back up it would be nice to know with greater granularity how full it really was.  I dislike unplugging it not knowing if its 76% or 90% full.All in all I really like the battery pack.  It's ridiculous size has saved by phone more than once and it has solid build quality. Obviously there are a few things on the want list, but they can be handedly over looked for the great product that it is. Unless you really need it to smart negotiate the charging rate.  It has completely replaced my solar rechargeable 8000mAh battery that used to do this work and has been a great companion battery for about 2 months now.

Firstly, it is quite large (about the size of an iPhone but considerably thicker) and reasonably heavy. This gives the feeling of being a robust and substantial product. It has a pleasant feel to it and can be held in one hand.The second way in which it is hefty is in the amount of charge it holds. I was given a free product in exchange for a review and so I spent a week using the battery as the sole way in which to charge my electronic devices just to see how long it lasted. A week later, I had used it to charge my phone, Kindle, iPod and a bluetooth speaker on more than one occasion and had still only used 25% of the charge. This is very impressive, especially as it can charge two items at the same time (one slot is specifically for items such as tablets but you can recharge smaller devices in it as well) - larger items use more power but you should still get quite a few recharges from this product. The battery also doubles as a very effective small torch which will last a very long time but which is probably a bit unwieldy to hold for considerable periods because of the weight and the size of the battery (people with strong, large hands will be fine).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CAMCCLQ" id="B00CAMCCLQ-review21" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-17:</strong> Bought 2 of these for a long trip.

After I plugged it into the charger for literally a couple of seconds, the usage indicator lights stayed on.

Granted, there's only so much it can stop, but almost any minor event which otherwise would have scratched the very easily scratched screen (this is my second Pebble, and the screen on the first was scratched almost immediately) will instead initially scratch this cover, and then it will heal.The front and main back parts are easy to apply. The side pieces - and the thin back side pieces - are more difficult to apply and less worthwhile as well as being more visible.My advice would be to apply the front and main back parts and the button covers and to ignore the rest - I don't think you'll end up wishing you'd put the awkward-to-install side parts on, and it's hard to think of situations where they'd protect the watch.I left mine to dry overnight and have had no issues with it in the month it's been on.

I used too much and it ended up sliding all over the place, but after letting it dry for a little while it was fine. The problem I have with it, is there are two imperfections on the screen area. Usually a piece of tape can take these off with no problem, but I've had no such luck with this one. There is a small black speck on the screen that is very apparent with certain watch faces, but it's not a noticeable problem on the face I usually use. There is also a sliver speck right above the screen that refuses to go away. There are also a few streaks that seem less transparent than others. These may be user error, but I was very careful to keep a clean environment while applying the protector. It'll do the job, but I'll replace it once I get another one since Skinomi included a voucher for a free screen protector for writing a review, which is a great incentive. Overall, I'd recommend the product to keep your Pebble pristine.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00B11AV42" id="B00B11AV42-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-24:</strong> I bought this screen protector a few months back and it started to peel.

I had to upgrade from my Motorola Backflip which if you think the Captivate is memory bound just look at the Backflip. Having seen a Captivate from a person in the seat next to me on the airplane I knew it was the phone I wanted to move to.It wasn't until I got the phone that the one feature I depend on as a road warrior, GPS, doesn't work well on the Captivate. Getting a GPS lock takes time. Tracking while moving in a vehicle and it can't keep up. I tried all the "settings" people posted which basically only helped the initial lock time from minutes to less than a minute. Tracking is useless. Since I truly love the other features of the phone I sprung for a GPS dongle which hopefully will resolve my GPS issue. But a phone as expensive as the Captivate it should have GPS working out of the box. Even the Motorola Backflip GPS works better than the Captivate which is sad. On the Captivate I tried Google Maps Navigation, Waze and CoPilot Live which all worked just fine on the Backflip on the same streets I've tried the Captivate out on.Otherwise all the great things people have posted about the screen are true. Memory wise it is way better than the Backflip and the processor is loads faster. Photos are amazing even without a flash. Haven't done a video yet.But I can't recommend this phone due to the poor quality GPS. Even rooting and installing Android v2.2 (Cognition ROM v2.3b8) made no difference to navigation.  The lock is slightly faster but it just does not keep up on the road.  You need a GPS dongle (see below) to get navigation to work.  I used the Google Navigator application but Waze and CoPilot Live both exhibit the same behavior with the built in GPS.[Update: Jan 7, 2011] Received the GlobalSat BT-395 from Amazon and it works with the Captivate! Download the free "Bluetooth GPS" application from Android market and use that to connect to the 395. This has made the Captivate function as a navigation device... finally. Though I do have the downside of having to carry yet another device in my jacket pocket and remember to charge it up every so often.I also happened across an issue of Consumer Reports yesterday that ranked the Captivate right behind the iPhone 4. This is another reason I've stopped relying on Consumer Reports. They rated the navigation on the Captivate as "Very good" when it is not.[Update Jan 19, 2011] Knocked it down to one star because GPS does not work for navigation on Android v2.2 using the Cognition ROM. I do not recommend people go down this path unless they are highly technically skilled. But it doesn't fix anything. The lock time is faster than stock but navigation is still too far behind to be of any use. This looks like a hardware problem. Avoid this phone if you need to use GPS for navigation (unless you invest in a dongle like I did).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003TLMQG8" id="B003TLMQG8-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-07-23:</strong> After 2 years of the iPhone with minimal personalization, no multiple apps, crummy reception and excessive dropped calls; I could not be happier with my Captivate.

CANNOT WAIT TO UPGRADE.I was in love with it for the first few months.  Then it started with random lock-ups that could only be relieved with a battery-pull. And, the phone is S-L-O-W with everything it does, although I make sure I have nothing running in the background.  It really is not a pleasure to use at all.I've upgraded the software twice (it came with with Eclair and I upgraded to Froyo and now Gingerbread).  Samsung does NOT make upgrading the software easy either.I use this phone for work, and it has proven extremely unreliable with the lock-ups.  The reception is very weak as well, compared to an iPhone 3GS and 4S and because of this I use an AT&T; M-Cell, which gives me 5 bars.The screen on this phone is stunning and the size is nice, but I can't tell you how many times I wanted to throw it against the wall due to these irritating lock-ups and slow response.This is what I get for trying the FIRST version of hardware.  I'd like to think that Samsung has ironed out the bugs with this phone with later releases, but think I'll try HTC next.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003TLMQG8" id="B003TLMQG8-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-01-08:</strong> I was very enthusiastic about this Galaxy S phone, brilliant 4" touchscreen, Android OS and a host of other smartphone features, what else could I ask for? So I purchased one through Amazon Wireless in September for $99 with a two year upgrade on my family plan.Unfortunately I was not prepared for the reality. Some features simply did not work right and others didn't work at all. Even more frustrating has been the epic wait for an upgrade to Android OS 2.2 (Froyo) One drawback that I knew of and decided to swallow was allowing AT&T; to decide which apps would be available for your Android. After all the hype about openness and freedom to use the device the way you want, AT&T;'s Android phones all disappoint. Many of the best apps are not available (Firefox, Skype, and a bunch of other ones that are available on Verizon's Droids.) This has been increasing frustrating the longer I have had the phone.Let's continue in chronological order with the problems I found after purchasing the Captivate:First, I found out that email forwarding and sometimes replying would truncate the original text in the message after about one line of text. It was very embarrassing trying to forward a message to someone only to have them respond, "What are you talking about?"Second, I found out that Wifi, by default would turn off as soon as the screen turns off, meaning that if you were listening to Pandora on Wifi and you had a limited data plan, you could quickly find yourself over the data limit, even though you thought you were using Wifi. (cough*AT&T; conspiracy*cough) There is a hidden menu within the Wifi settings menu that allows you to set the Wifi sleep policy to never. More recently I have been having problems with Wifi where it appears that I am connected, but there is no internet connectivity, even with my home network. This has been a big issue for me as I have a 200MB monthly limit on data, and that would not be a problem if Wifi worked.Third, I found out on my Thanksgiving trip that the GPS DOES NOT WORK. I had read some complaints about the GPS on forums before, but didn't realize it was a problem affecting ALL Captivate phones (perhaps all Galaxy S phones)Maybe I was spoiled by my previous phone (Blackberry Curve 8310) which now seems much more plain than anything else out there, however, everything on that phone WORKED! emailing was flawless, GPS and Wifi always performed as expected (it didn't have Wifi ;)Samsung finally released a GPS "fix" called "GPS Restore" in early December that was supposed to calibrate the GPS and eliminate the problem for good. It turned out to be just smoke and mirrors. I don't use the GPS all the time but when I do, I need it to work. While trying to find a gas station off the highway earlier this week, I almost ran out of gas driving around, not knowing where I was. The GPS placed my two exits back with an accuracy radius of at least 2 miles. A few times the radius shrank down to a few hundred feet but still placed my in the wrong location. It just doesn't work and it is unacceptable.Finally, and this has been a problem from the start, we were promised Froyo within a couple of weeks, back in September. It is January and we are still stuck with android 2.1 while the Nexus S, which is practically the same phone, is running android 2.3 (Gingerbread) I blame mostly Samsung for this as other Galaxy S phones are also stranded waiting for the update. Interestingly, the rest of the world with a Galaxy S phone has already been updated to Android 2.2 so perhaps AT&T; should take part of the blame here. You may not think 2.2 vs 2.1 is a big deal, but believe me, it is. Froyo would allow you to forward emails and it even allows you to edit the text you are forwarding/ including in a reply. Supposedly it would fix the GPS issue, although I am skeptical of this and it would allow your phone to run much faster by fully utilizing its resources.Bottom line, If you are at all enthusiastic about this phone for any reason, you will be disappointed.Otherwise you may find it works for you and it is just fine. After all, it is has the best screen on the market, 4" Super AMOLED with the best colors I have ever seen on a phone. Only the iPhone can compete with the screen but on different parameters - its resolution is betterThe 1Ghz processor is fast, although it would be much faster on Froyo or Gingerbread if there is ever an update.The camera takes great pictures where there is enough light (no flash) and the video recorder is also surprisingly sharp for a phone.SWYPE is awesome, the best text entry experience on a phone.The Vibrate is very weak and I often do not feel it.Adobe Flash also doesn't work, maybe its not the latest version, maybe it just doesn't have flash, I don't know but it doesn't work.Finally, support has been a joke. AT&T; consistently tries to pass me off to Samsung, which tries to blame Google's Angroid for many of these issues, AT&T;'s update in September was supposed to fix the email issue and it appeared to fix it once, so that I get off their case, later on, I still couldn't forward messages. After describing all of these problems to Samsung they said they will be happy to fix everything if I only send my phone in for 6 days and let them reset it to factory settings (Thanks, but no thanks.)I will think very carefully if I ever want to get another AT&T; phone or another Samsung phone. Verizon's Droids seem a much better alternative but I would love to get my hands on a Nexus S, unfortunately I am locked in for another 20 months before I can even dream of dumping AT&T;.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003TLMQG8" id="B003TLMQG8-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-03-20:</strong> I bought this phone 3 months ago for 60$ and have been using it since.

I bought mine in August, after hearing Android 2.2 would be rolled out in an OTA update (over the air update) in September.  It's now January and I still haven't received an official update.In addition to the lack of updates, many users experience issues with being able to acquire a GPS lock, and having their phone "mount" as a logical volume (like a flash drive) when they connect their phone to their PC with a USB cable.Luckily, the XDA community has alleviated these issue by making unofficial versions Android 2.2 available with fixes for these problems... but average consumers aren't going to have the patience or desire to manually update their phones (nor should they).  And, there are risks involved in doing so -- from potentially not being able to receive future, official OTA updates to potentially bricking your phone.Steer clear of this device!  Other manufacturers offer comparable hardware with better software release cycles.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003TLMQG8" id="B003TLMQG8-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-12-14:</strong> This is my first Android phone, and I really love it! The fact that I got it for a penny (yes, one penny) through Amazon Wireless is just icing on the cake!  I haven't had this phone for very long, so my review is based on what I've experienced so far.Pros:The big, beautiful screen is wonderful. The colors are so vibrant.I love being able to enter so much information for my contacts.The keyboard is great, if not a bit sensitive.  However, a stylus helps with that. I'm still trying master the Swype keyboard. It isn't as easy as the videos make it look (big surprise).Being able to store so much information on the phone is great. I've downloaded lots of music, plus folders, and still have a ton of memory left.Love the variety of Android apps. I download them when I have access to WiFi, so that I don't use up my limited data plan.Unlike some reviewers have indicated, the GPS worked fine when I tried it.I actually don't make very many phone calls, but when I have done so, the caller's voice was very clear.This phone pairs up with other Bluetooth devices very easily.The pictures and videos I've taken, look great.Cons:I'm not happy that many web sites haven't caught up to the Android, yet. I tried to access numerous free TV sites only to be told that none of them support Android at this time. I hope this is something that will be rectified soon.After having dealt with Sony-Ericsson support people, I've been very disappointed with Samsung support. Their web site isn't very user-friendly, and they keep apologizing about their lack of information as to when this or that will be available. Also, after a very long chat with a Samsung person, to no avail, I finally got the help I needed from an AT&T; tech.UPDATE!!I've had this phone for seven months now, and I'm not as crazy about it as I was in the beginning.I will not be buying another Samsung phone because Samsung support sucks. When they came out with an update that included a Flash Player, I had trouble downloading it, contacted Samsung, and they never answered back. I've been too frustrated to do anything about it, but plan to call AT&T; support to see if I can get any help from them.Ending a phone call on this thing takes forever. Sometimes I have to press "End Call" for a long time before it will end, and I have to watch very carefully to make sure it doesn't stay connected.Making a phone call isn't that easy, either. It's hard to explain exactly what this phone does, but it sometimes seems to have a mind of its own when it comes to making phone calls.  I'm just glad I don't make that many of them, or I would probably have thrown it against a wall by now!The phone has become very difficult to turn off.  I have to hold the side button for a long time, and then I have to press on the "Power Off" button for what seems like forever. It shouldn't be that hard to turn the blasted phone off!I still like it for surfing the web, and it picks up on WiFi pretty easily so that I don't have to pay AT&T; for data usage. However, when my contract is up, I will be choosing another phone, probably from Sony Ericsson or Motorola.UPDATE III finally took my phone to an AT&T; repair store, and they agreed that it was "buggy," so they replaced it. The replacement phone, with its upgrade to 2.2, works much, much better, so I'm a bit happier.  That being said, I still want a different phone when my upgrade time comes.  I've been looking at the HTC, and have added it to my list of phones to consider.BTW, when I was at the repair store, I overheard one of the reps tell someone that the Pantech phones were the most trouble-free phones. I don't know if they make an Android phone, but if they do, I might look at that brand as well.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003TLMQG8" id="B003TLMQG8-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-02-12:</strong> Like many, I was looking for a phone as an alternative to the iPhone 4, if only because all my fanboi friends had an iPhone. According to the reviews, this phone fit the bill perfectly. But after 6 months, I can honestly say it was not a good purchase, even tho the phone does have a lot going for it.Pluses:Excellent camera--takes clear pictures, and the panorama feature is pretty cool.Screen is bright, clear, and honestly is one of the best displays on the market at the time. HD video on YouTube is crystal clear.You can increase the internal storage by the addition of a mini hd card--much cheaper than buying a larger capacity iPhone.Battery life was not bad.Minuses:Crapware that ATT installs is hugely annoying.Compared to the iPhone, the  interface is clunky. Probably not an issue for most, but since I use my phone a lot it became a big annoyance.Exchange mail was impossible. Gmail will not support Exchange unless you go with the enterprise version of Gmail, something my business was unwilling to do. I tried a few 3rd party exchange clients, they were all buggy. Also could not get Exchange to route to Gmail. This was a huge fail for me, as I need access to my corp mail. Probably my fault for not researching better, but yeah, Exchange mail on this phone was a no go.I did not experience the random shutting off issue, but the phone would occasionally get the hiccups when I tried to do more than one thing at a time.The four command buttons at the bottom of the screen had to be hit precisely or they would not function. Huge fail. Apple's one button system is far better. Perhaps my sausage fingers are to blame.Web browsing: Extremely painful--no mater what browser I used. Pages would not display correctly, page loads were slow, sometimes not loading at all. Probably not the phones fault but the browsers'.Call quality: switching from a Motorola Razr, I noticed an immediate downgrade in call quality. People complained that they could not hear me, that I sounded tinny. Had the same issues when listening to others. I also had tons of dropped calls, which I assumed was the fault of ATTs network. I also had issues getting on the network in remote locations, which I assumed was the network. But my friends had no issue connecting to the same network with their ATT phones. Many missed texts and "where are u?"Since switching to an iPhone 4 on ATT, I have not had as many dropped calls or network issues. I still do have problems with ATT, but not as many.GPS: Broken. No fix in sight.Updates: Doubt Froyo 2.2 will ever be released for this phone.In the end, I sold the Captivate and bought an iPhone 4, and since then I have had none of the issues that I had with the Captivate. Best decision I ever made, even if I now feel like a fanboi. Guess I can live with that.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003TLMQG8" id="B003TLMQG8-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-01-19:</strong> I've had this phone for several months now.

But I was due a new phone and after doing a ton of research, I decided to try the world of Android and get the Samsung Captivate. I was really impressed by the iPhone 4, but I liked the bright and brilliant screen of the Captivate and I thought it would be fun learning something new, which also got great reviews. I new that by choosing the Captivate I would be getting slightly inferior screen resolution, no front camera or flash, and a camera that is not nearly as good as that found on the iPhone 4. But the screen won me over.Last night I picked up my brand new Captivate and was really excited about trying it out. I did express my concerns about the many reports I had read about its poor quality GPS and I was told that I could return the phone if the GPS was not working properly. A store employee told me that I needed to download the newest version of Google Maps to insure that the GPS would work to its best capacity. He did the download, but it was my "impression" at the store, that the download may not have worked correctly. My intuition turned out to be correct.So I took the Captivate home and tried out the new GPS. Alas, it did not work at all. I made some adjustments recommended at several Captivate forums and still no luck. I moved to other locations and still no reading. I then started downloading several very well known apps like Amazon Kindle and the NY Times and I noticed that after waiting one hour for the apps to show up on my phone, that none of the downloads were working correctly. When I clicked on "market", I was informed that the downloads were just starting.I decided to return the phone to the store. Even though the store is located in a very heavily trafficked area, even there the GPS could not ascertain a location. Also the store employees agreed that the downloads were not functioning properly. In my view, they acted like they had seen these problems with the Captivate before, but I can't say for sure.Anyway, I exchanged it for an iPhone 4 which works perfectly right out of the box. I probably got a lemon, but given my problems, I would have some serious concerns about the build quality of the Captivate.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003TLMQG8" id="B003TLMQG8-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-08-17:</strong> First Off Amazon should only allow reviews from people who purchased the items from there site.I usually will only review items that I have purchased directly from amazon as verifiable proof of my purchase for the people reading the review, But all these bogus reviews made me want to add my 2cents.

Battery is a pain if you do all the things this phone is capable of doing...I have had it for 3 days and have had to charge it every day....Like the phone so far... just wish there were more choices with AT&T; for androids...</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003TLMQG8" id="B003TLMQG8-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-12-17:</strong> I am not going to repeat all the nice things said about this phone.  Yes, it is very fast, and the screen is beautiful, sound quality is excellent, and Android has not been mangled too badly by AT&T.;  I had to take two stars off though and for following reasons that have to do with basic fuctionality of the device: one star for GPS - it just plain doesn't work, so far it hasn't been able to see one satellite, by the window, outdoors - doesn't matter, nothing.  As a matter of fact, I feel that the lack of concern that Samsung and AT&T; show regarding this issue deserves an extra star.  The second star is taken for non-functioning Skype.  I spend a lot of time in buildings with no cellular reception but coverred with wi-fi, and using Skype as an alternative way of voice communication has been my plan when I bought the phone.  Skype, however, does not work on Captivate, at least not with current software.  Supposedly this will be rectified when Android is upgraded to 2.2, but so far AT&T; is silent on this issue, and it is not clear when and if such an update will be released.  So all in all, the hardware has great potential it just seems that neither manufacturer, nor carrier have particular interest in making it work properly.Update. After a visit to AT&T; store and a soft reset GPS now works well outside and in the car.  There is no reception indoors, but that really doesn't bother me that much.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003TLMQG8" id="B003TLMQG8-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-09-05:</strong> This phone really is slick.  The screen is gorgeous and bright, and the processor and GPU are amazing.  The camera takes good photos in decent light, and it also takes good high-resolution videos.  It feels very nice in the hand and is very light without feeling cheaply made.  The screen is also made of Gorilla Glass so it's nice and scratch resistant.However, there are a few things to keep in mind.  There is no flash for the camera, so pictures in low light situations won't turn out very good at all.  There's a night mode in the camera app, but it doesn't do all that much to help.  There's also no trackball/notification light so you won't know if you have messages or e-mails without actually waking the device.  The phone is a very symmetrical design so it can be hard to know which end is the top when pulling it out of your pocket, so you'll constantly find yourself holding it upside down when you go to look at it.  There's also the issue of AT&T; disabling HSUPA on this phone.  The hardware is perfectly capable of doing HSUPA, but AT&T; has turned it off so that those frequencies are less crowded for those using the iDevice.  We wouldn't want THEM to have slow upload speeds, now would we?But the real drawback is the crapware Samsung loaded on here.  TouchWiz, while it looks pretty nice, performs pretty terribly.  The development community has released lagfixes that speed up the phone considerably (I recommend Super Rooter Extreme for an all in one solution), but hopefully when Samsung releases Froyo it will have fixed all the lag issues.  Basically, for some reason when you launch an app it can stutter and the phone freezes for a second or two before it does anything.  Also, when rebooting the phone it takes forever to scan the onboard media storage to look for changes.  If you're willing to root there are temporary fixes in place that work well enough, but Samsung needs to take the reigns and get this squared away on their end, since other phones running stock Android don't have this problem.In the end, I still highly recommend it.  It's a bit more future-proof than the Nexus One (the only other high-end Android phone I would recommend on AT&T;) as far as hardware is concerned because the Hummingbird chipset is currently unrivaled for sheer power, and since there are Galaxy S phones running this chipset on multiple carriers the development community will come up with some great stuff for these phones over time.  Just know that the way things sit right now you'll have to put up with some quirks until Samsung (or more likely the dev community) fixes them.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003TLMQG8" id="B003TLMQG8-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-10-10:</strong> I was holding out to get an Android. I wanted to make sure I got one worth the money & new contract. After hearing all the amazing reviews of Samsung Galaxy S I decided to go for it. I've owned this phone now for about 2 months. It was easy to set up, set up my email, use Facebook, and connects to my wireless internet at home with no problems. I've browsed the web, shopped for apps, and never have problems. The phone works great, no issues there. There is an unlimited amount of options to set up this phone to how you would like it when it comes to settings, displays, sounds, etc. Videos look amazing! The phone is very responsive, scroll through the screens with a quick flip of the finger with no freezing or delay. My favorite part is Swype! How did I ever text without this? I watched the little tutorial and was a little intimidated, didn't think I would be able to get it down or that it just wouldn't work. Within about a minute of practicing I was flying through text with no problem. Long texts take just a second now & I don't have to abbreviate to save time... it's amazing! Not sure I will be able to go back to the old way. I use the alarm to get up in the morning & it hasn't let me down yet. I haven't had any of the issues I have seen in other reviews with the phone shutting down or locking up. Battery life was a little bad at first, I looked around on some forums & found tips that worked out well. To save on battery life make sure you don't have the brightness on the screen set too high, if you use Live wallpapers that will drain your phone, I also have the vibration shut off for when you touch the screen, etc. Since making these little adjustments battery life has been fine. I always charge my phone at night no matter what the battery level is so I can't say how long it would last beyond a day. Great little phone, I would definitely buy this again!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003TLMQG8" id="B003TLMQG8-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-09-09:</strong> I've had the Captivate (or "Galaxy S") for a month now, and the whole time I've been bursting at the seams to review it...but first I had to take a little bit of time to separate what's great about the Captivate that's specific to the phone, versus what's great about a Droid-based smart phone in particular.First off, the Android OS is really very enjoyable.  The top-level screen can have 5 pages of whatever you like and the Applications page neatly organizes installed apps separately, to page through them as well.  If you're not familiar with this concept, think of the top-level screen as being similar to the Windows or Mac Desktop and the Applications area as being similar to the Start Menu/Launch Bar of your favorite computer OS.The best thing about the Captivate is the hardware:  the screen really takes up almost all of the phone's face, and it's vivid, colorful, and bright.  The battery cover is a slick one-two slide that makes it easy to access without being the first thing to fall off if you drop the phone.  The 1GHz processor inside the phone makes apps speedy, and I even find it to be fairly nimble about data use, easily grabbing onto my favorite Wi-Fi networks when I'm in range, then switching seamlessly over to AT&T;'s data network when I'm not.Then we have the good things about the Captivate:  calls are clear, I've had strong and clean reception even when I notice a drop in bars, and on those rare occasions I step into a dead zone, it seems to try its very best to hang on to the call...I can't explain it in technical detail, it's just the gut impression I get when I've driven or walked through areas that typically give me trouble on any phone and against all odds I stay connected (my office, for instance, is up against a cliff wall that closes further in near the top of the building).  One complaint about this phone (and many smart phones) has been battery drain, but I find it manageable:  if I choose to use the Power Toolbar (built-in and easy to add) and Advanced Task Killer app (a separate download, and a must for any smart phone owner), I can go 2 or 3 days on a single charge.  Usually it's easier to top it off at the end of the day or leave it plugged in when I'm not going to be using it for a while.  While the Captivate seems very wide, it is also very slim and thus surprisingly light.  I added the carbon-fiber hard case to the outside and it still weighs noticeably less than an iPhone 4.Using the Captivate is fairly simple:  the connector port for the charger or a data cable are one and the same:  a "micro" USB connector with a tiny sliding door to keep dirt out.  I much prefer this to the plastic peel-away tab that usually comes off in your hand if you're not careful.  The charger that comes with the phone also pops apart into a data cable, allowing you to detach the AC outlet prongs and connect to the computer.  And last, the navigation buttons are just four touch-sensitive spots along the base of the screen, with a slide rocker on the left side of the phone (for volume) and an unlock button on the right.  I've heard people say it's hard to pinch a button on one side without accidentally hitting the other (such as turning down the volume when you go to unlock the phone), but I haven't had this problem.More on the OS:  using Android 2.1 (soon to be FROYO), I find myself discovering neat little features that I enjoy.  For example, some of the wallpapers are interactive with the touch screen.  When I'm playing music, if I need to pause, I don't have to unlock the phone:  a tiny CD logo appears in the top with controls for pause/next/back.  The "Swype" feature of the OS is extremely responsive.  I didn't have to adjust any of this - the sensitivity really seems balanced between "must mash to get a response" and "breathed on it and accidentally deleted something".  Unlocking the phone requires a tap of the button and a swipe along the touch screen.  Even the tilt--a feature that began to annoy me in my Nokia phone--seems to both be quick to respond and easy to correct if you didn't mean to rotate the screen.Much as I enjoy this phone, all is not perfect.  The buttons sometimes don't respond properly.  There are times I have to tap twice, and there are times I try to hit 'back' and accidentally hit 'search' instead.  I'm not sure how much of that is in the programming, the hardware, or my thick thumbs.  The Search window is extremely handy, but it doesn't always frame the search properly.  For example, I might be in an app that has a long list of items on the screen, and search will zoom down the list straight to the item I'm looking for...and then in another app the search might launch a web browser and search the Internet for what I typed in.  I haven't really learned a good way to scroll down a long screen:  often I have to just flick downwards again and again until I get where I'm going.  And probably the most annoying feature is the actual call interface.  I haven't taken that final step to voice-activate my favorite call list, so when I manually drill into my contacts or favorites to find someone to call, it seems to require more steps than it should to place a call:  find the contact, tap their picture, tap the "phone" icon, if they have two numbers associated with them you have to specify which, and then you get to tap "call".The biggest drawback--and controversy--surrounding this phone though has to do with apps.  I've been very happy with my selection from the Android Market thus far, but I understand AT&T; prevents you from "side loading" other programs.  Apparently if you want something the market doesn't have to offer, you need to download an SDK (a developer's kit for programming mobile apps), "root" your phone, and follow some very specific steps to get it to work...some of which may brick the phone.  That's not bothered me here or there, but what has bothered me is my complete inability to remove all the AT&T; garbage that's been loaded on the phone.  For example, I like the Android Music Player app, but I really don't want the AT&T; Music app that promises to guzzle data and stream all my music (and requires me to pay a monthly fee).  There are Navigation apps that function this same way:  now that I have Google Navigation, I'd rather yank the AT&T; stuff off...but I can't.  I can either ignore it...or go the "root and try not to brick" route.  I've been an AT&T; customer for almost 10 years now, and what I always liked most about them was my freedom of choice.There have been some complaints about the fact that the Captivate's camera lacks a flash.  It is a shame that this feature is missing, but apart from that I have to say that the pictures I have taken with the phone have been excellent, better than the first digital camera I purchased years ago and definitely better than the last phone I had, which did have a flash.  The interface for the phone is dirt-simple, and can even lock in standby mode, in case you want to tuck it away for a bit, but be ready to shoot with a tap of the unlock button.  The Gallery app in the Android OS does a snappy job of both organizing my groups of pictures and in making it easy to flip through:  clean thumbnails tell me at a glance which collection of pictures I'm looking at so I can select the group I want to view.If you're in the market for a smart phone and you'd like to try the Droid OS, I can't say enough about the Captivate.  It's got a brilliant screen, speedy hardware, and runs the OS quite smoothly.  If you're an AT&T; customer, you should be prepared to ignore (or deal with) the pre-loaded apps.  Either way, this is quite an excellent smart phone, whose benefits far outweigh its drawbacks.USEFUL TIP:  when connecting to a computer, it's not immediately obvious how to make it work, and a lot of people are having problems.  When you connect the cable, the "Smart Phone (Kies)" option doesn't appear to work.  Instead, you have to choose "USB (mass storage)"...which then still doesn't make the phone's files and folders show up in Windows--in Windows 7 it will just tell you a Samsung Captivate has been connected to the computer, but you can't "see" it.  You have to take one extra step:  from the main screen, access the pull-down menu.  You will see "USB Connected" in the list of notifications.  Tap that, and you'll get a prompt to "Mount" the phone.  The moment you do this, everything works:  the phone maps two drives (one for the phone's memory, one for your memory card) and you can access files and folders just as you do on a USB "thumb" drive.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B003TLMQG8', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B003TLMQG8', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B003D29KVM</h2>    <p class="price"> $B003D29KVM</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003D29KVM" id="B003D29KVM-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-16:</strong> Ordered on Dec. 14th, received on Jan. 14th, okay considering it shipped from Hong Kong.The case itself is okay, fits the phone a little funny, but that may be b/c it's been in a shipping envelope for so long.

The line drawing also shows the clip on the bag of the TAG. As a male user of average height (70"), I'm not sure where you are supposed clip it. Cord length was too short to comfortably allow the earbuds to reach my ears with sufficient slack.The TAG body is slightly larger than a standard military dogtag, and about a 0.25" thick. IF you have a shirt or jacket with a front pocket it will go well there. Otherwise, if you a person of a certain age, be prepared to look like a person of a certain age trying to be hard to be hip.As for its Bluetooth and telephone functionality, it worked great. It was immediately recognized by an HTC EVO LTE, and both incoming and outgoing call quality was fine (and I have no idea where the microphone elements are!). Music playback quality was also acceptable considering the limitations of both .mp3 source materials and the earbud form factor.The integrated FM tuner worked fine also, but be prepared. There is no frequency display. This would be a great opportunity to deliver a smartphone app to remedy that. I live in a crowed FM environment between two major metro areas, and although it readily scans to the next available station, you'll be pressing the button a lot to locate your station...or tune away from commercials.Good telephony and music playback functions, awkward wearing options and challenging FM user interface. These are surprising lapses for a device that is encroaching on the higher end of the price range for similar products.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BY5GVPI" id="B00BY5GVPI-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-29:</strong> Retro, as in the FM radio.If you listen to FM radio (as opposed to streaming), and want a quality headset that will work with your bluetooth phone, the Jabra TAG is idea.Pros:-FM radio included-decent battery life-comfortable-good audio quality (not great for music, but acceptable)Cons:-limited noise reduction</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BY5GVPI" id="B00BY5GVPI-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-24:</strong> So, you know when you read a great book and go out and get 10 copies to give to your friends and family?  Well, this is like that.The "Tag" is like a necklace that has a clip so you could also clip to your collar or a front pocket.  It has earbuds.  You sync it up with any bluetooth enabled device and are free to go about your business.  Sync it with your phone and you can take calls with it.  Sync it to your computer and you can listen to your music library while you do dishes.  Sync it to your TV so you can watch your shows without waking up your spouse/baby/dog/cat/whatever.So far, the phone thing is awesome because it means no more hunting in my purse or computer bag to get my phone and no accidental dialing or hanging up like was happening with my jawbone.  I like that it can hang around your neck and weighs next to nothing and can clip to your shirt so is great for jogging/exercising or biking (PSA: do not wear headphones while jogging or bike riding and get run over or run into, be smart, duh.)It charges up using the same connector almost everything electronic I own uses except iPods (same charger as my Galaxy Nexus and can be charged off the USB port on my iBook).It is pretty unobtrusive(I'm not a big fan of people shouting into their headsets on their cell phones like they are the only person on earth) and it is has really good sound just like most of my other Jabra products.Comes with different sized earbud covers that are very soft.  These don't hurt my ears like the ones that come with my iPods.Finally, an added plus is you can sync to two items- listen to music on your computer and switch over if a call comes through on your phone.Last but not least, the loop that acts as the necklace/dogtag portion is adjustable.  You can clip it on your collar and shorten it or pop it in a pocket and lengthen it.I have not been a big fan of bluetooth accessories.  I'm one of those weirdos who doesn't take calls on my phone in the car- but I do like this so I don't have to leap across the room, dive over the bed and try to dg through my purse to get my phone before it stops ringing.One caveat: the wiring looks a little on the wimpy side but I'm hoping it holds up as well as my other Jabra products have(and Jabra has been awesome about customer service- I got a cord sent to me free when one I had got kinked and stopped working correctly.  Would be nice if it came with a case but I could also see myself just wearing this alot of the time.THIS IS NOT AN MP3 PLAYER- it does not store data- it is a bluetooth device with a great design for multiple purposes.

I cant envision a scenario where this would be preferable over any other option. I thought maybe for skiing where I could leave my very expensive iPhone safely in a backpack, but after sometime with this bad boy I probably would just run a pair of headphones from an inside pocket (like I usually do) so I wouldnt have to deal with the terrible buttons.It paired with my phone easily enough, but wouldnt pair with my computer. That was the one use I thought i might have for it. Being able to walk away from my computer while still listening to it. Every time I tried on my macbook pro though I got error messages. I've connected to lots of other devices no problem. The necklace doesnt really work for me. The earphones fall out. The range is about two rooms. I never got better than 5 hours battery life. The charger is ridiculously short, and works via wall plug necessitating you leaving it on the ground to charge. The Fm tuner sans display means your constantly just guessing as to where youre going next. The buttons were often times unresponsive. For working out I'd use a shuffle, or an armband plus headphones.On the plus side, it is light. Did pair with my phone quickly, and you can wear it (only if using included headphones) as a dog tag. If I find a really stellar use for this I'll update accordingly...</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BY5GVPI" id="B00BY5GVPI-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-08:</strong> The Jabra Tag is what I would consider a niche product.  If you are looking for a self-contained audio device (MP3 player, radio, etc.) this is not it.  Rather, this is something you can use to interface with your primary audio product, be it a Bluetooth-enabled smart phone, tablet, laptop, etc.In the box you get the Tag, an AC charger, a USB cable, earbuds, and instructions.The Tag is compact, and, you guessed it, about the size of an actual military "dog tag."  At about " thick, it is thicker than a real dog tag.Controls are minimal with a Power button (labeled "Jabra"), Volume Up and Down buttons on the side, and Back, Forward, and FM buttons on the front.  The Jabra button performs other functions, such as pairing, acting as the Play button, controlling calls, etc.You can wear the dog tag around your neck like a real dog tag (you supply the lanyard), or clip it on to your clothing.  The microphone is on board, not on the ear buds, so if you intend to use the Tag to field phone calls, keep in mind you want to wear the Tag reasonably close to your mouth (not on your waist, etc.)If you want to be able to keep your phone in your pocket, holstered, etc. and still listen to music, this is a nice product.  Sound quality is good, while not outstanding.  I tried a better set of ear buds I own, rather than the included pair, and this addressed the issue, with a dramatic uptick in audio quality.Call quality is average.  The microphone is on the body of the Tag and there isn't much noise cancelling going on. It is acceptable though and you can conduct a phone call, but it is not going to be of superior quality.The Tag's FM tuner is OK, but reminds me of a cheap "scan to the next station" type of radio found on novelty radios and inexpensive dollar store products.  You cannot tune to specific stations, but rather must scan from one to the next to find the stations you want to hear.  Once you find a station you like, you can press the FM button twice to store it.  But since there is no display, you cannot tune directly to something.Pairing is simple, very similar to other Bluetooth products.  With the Tag off, hold down the Jabra button for a few seconds.  The LED will flash blue.  At that point, follow the steps on your phone, etc. to use Bluetooth.  If prompted, the pairing code on the Tag is 0000.  I successfully paired with a Blackberry Bold 9900, iPad 2, iPhone 5, and my old Motorola RAZR.  No issues.Battery life is good.  A full charge takes close to 2 hours, and will last about 8 hours of "talk time" and over a week on standby.Overall, the Tag is nice but not something I would seek out as a phone call solution.  It is, however, a decent product to stream music and perhaps listen to some FM music, coupled with an adequate quality for phone calls.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BY5GVPI" id="B00BY5GVPI-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-05:</strong> I tried this out for a few days connected to an new iPad and iphone4.Pros:-It's bluetooth, so...you know it's wireless.

The first one that I used, the Jabra Clipper, is still among my favorite bluetooth devices. It had/has a minor design flaw (it is hard to actually *clip* it to anything), but it is a great product. The Jabra Tag takes all of the features of the Jabra Clipper and (mostly) improves upon them.The Jabra Ta is a nice combination of a FM radio, bluetooth capability, and a hands free device. My biggest complaint (and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5) is that the earbuds on the Jabra Tag (just like the Jabra Tag)Notes-Bluetooth Unit- Easy to pair with bluetooth devices- Works as hand free calling device- Charge lasts several hours- Has a built in FM radio - The radio works pretty well - it doesn't have the strongest antenna for a FM radio.- Press the search left and right search keys for one second in order to advance stations.- Has volume controls on the unit - including the ability to play/pause and to answer calls.- You can use with any earbuds or headphones- The clip is not very firm and becomes loose pretty easily. This is not much of a negative, because the alternative to the clip coming loose is that the earbuds would fall out of your ears.Included Earbuds- Unlike the Jabra Clipper the earbuds that come standard with the Jabra Tag sounds better than expected. While I have heard better sounding earbuds - they are pretty good.- The earbuds are very comfortable - they feel very soft in your ear, which allows (me) to wear them for extended periods without worrying about them hurting.- They do a pretty good of noise isolation. I was able to listen to my favorite sports call in show (with ease) while on a riding lawn mower.- As mentioned the cable on the earbuds is too short - I wish it was 3"-6" longer. When I clip the Jabra Tag to my belt loop the cable on the earbuds becomes taught - eventually causing the Bluetooth Unit to come loose.Final Verdict - I am a fan of the Jabra Tag - it  offers a FM Radio with a compact bluetooth device.4 Stars</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BY5GVPI" id="B00BY5GVPI-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-21:</strong> I really liked the design of the Jabra TAG bluetooth headset and the idea of wearing it like a dog tag however the more I wore this headset as a dog tag, I found myself getting aggravated with it because of how sensitive the front buttons are so I tried wearing the tag up high, right below the collarbone, to try and prevent accidental button pushes, makes the headphone wires hang out excessively around the neck and ear area. You can switch out the headphones with a pair of your own but then you lose the ability to wear the headset as a dog tag because the clip on the headphones that come with the Tag that makes this possible is not removeable.Overall, this is a good bluetooth headset but it's design flaws are major ones in my opinion, especially if you were drawn to this device because of the dog tag style, that need to be corrected for it to be consider an excellent one, in addition to it's asking price.Pros:- Voice commands when pairing, turning on/off and notification of low battery.- Easy pairing with my iPhone 5- Ear cushions are comfortable- Sound comes through clear and music plays with a good mid-level bass.- Shows Headphones battery level in the top right area of the iPhone's display- The cord when rubbed against clothing etc. does NOT transmit static through the headphones- Phone calls are clear, no background echo.- The buttons are easy to access and all worked with the iPhone 5.- 3 front facing buttons:* Top Button, Multi-function: Make/Reject/Answer/Switch/Hold/Hangup Calls, Power On/Off, Pairing* Middle Button: Previous/Next Track or Scan for Radio Stations when in FM mode* Bottom Button: Turn FM Radio On/Off- Side Volume Buttons: Increase and Decrease- Voice notification of low battery starts when there is about 30 minutes of continuous play time left and repeats every 5 minutes until out of power then powers off automatically.- Supports controlling music and getting gps information from your bluetooth enabled device.- Uses Bluetooth 3.0- Will support other bluetooth devices that are compliant with bluetooth version 1.1 or higher- Can be used with other headphones- Can be worn lanyard style or clipped to clothing- A charger with a 12 inch cord is included but the TAG can be charged with any microUSB 5.0 volt charger.- Comes with three sets of ear cushions: 1 large, 1 medium and 1 smallNeutral:- I had to re-pair the Jabra TAG with my iPhone 5 (Delete pairing, turn off iPhone to reset it's bluetooth pairings, turn it back on then pair again) because the TAG's volume buttons would not work with my iPhone the first time I paired it.- Isn't noise cancelling.- 2 hour charge timeCons:- The placement of the main buttons on the front of the TAG plus how easy they are to push causes accidental Play/Pause, FM Radio On/Off, Calling the last number dialed and Previous/Next track incidents that can be very aggravating. All of these accidental button pushes have happened to me. I found in order to minimize this problem I have to either position the TAG high around the neck (which cause too much excess wires around the ears from the bunching) so it doesn't swing forward and hit something while move or leaning forward, or clipped to your clothing. Doing either of these doesn't insure 100% protection against accidental button pushes because the buttons are very sensitive and easy to push.- The headphone cord is too long for me which maybe because I'm a small person, 5'2". When I wear the headphones lanyard style I end up with too much slack in the line around my ears unless I adjust the device to sit mid-stomach which I don't prefer since this causes the accidental button pushes.- Can't remove the clip that turns the headphone cord into a lanyard style to use with other headphones.- Can't be used while charging.- FM Radio antenna is weak so I could only pick up 3-4 radio stations, depending on how much static interference.- Can't save radio stations as presets.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BY5GVPI" id="B00BY5GVPI-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-14:</strong> PROs - stylish, like the Street. Voice and light notification of functions. Listen to news and traffic or music with the FM radio while still being able to take or make phone calls. I have had a bit of a problem with reception of my favorite radio station, but I think that is the transmitter's problem, not the headset's problem, judging from the reception I have with my other radio on my desk. I also to not really expect it to work with stations that are far away - it is essentially a pocket radio receiver and not something with a large antenna. It has acceptable performance as a hands-free phone device.  The option to use any standard earphone is great too. As always, having a micro-USB charger included is wonderful as is not having to lug around a unique charging device. No problem connecting with my LG Cosmos 2 phone. Like other Bluetooth headphones, you can wear these and keep your expensive device hidden away from envious eyes or grabbing hands on a subway, etc.Cons - the combination necklace / earphone cord tends to make the earbuds pull out of my ears a bit more often than I would like.As a mass-transit commuter, I use this every day - this is a near-perfect device for me!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BY5GVPI" id="B00BY5GVPI-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-25:</strong> I wanted this head set to use in the gym; one that I could use without rattling around my iPod or iPhone and most of all so that it wouldn't be sweaty.

Access to my phone's podcasts through a Bluetooth connection make the miles fly by easier.  I've owned a couple of Jabra's Bluetooth headsets in the past, and the new Jabra Tag is an improvement.The Tag's key characteristics include:* Larger size and sturdier construction compared to earlier models/products;* A built-in FM radio (a first for the Jabra headsets I have used);* Noise-isolating ear buds that come in several size for a better fit;* Easier control of music, calls, and sound due to the increased size of the TAG and its controls;* About seven hours of battery life for playing music; and* A2DP wireless stream.The sound produced by the Tag is similar to other Jabra products, which it to say it's acceptable. What makes the Tag a better product is its increased size. It allows for a sturdier design and larger controls that better allow you to control playback without taking it out of your pocket. The larger size also makes it a little less likely that you will leave the unit in your pocket on its way to the washing machine.The inclusion of the FM receiver is an interesting feature. However, I wonder how useful it is given the ability to listen to music and radio stations using your smart phone through applications like Tune-In.One complaint is the volume setting for the built-in Jabra reminders. They are much louder than the programs and music I listen to, which results in some uncomfortable listening. Also, some will complain about the plastic materials used in the Tag's construction. It seems tough enough for my outdoor use. In fact, the Tag encourages my outdoor activities by allowing me to combine the drudgery of exercise with entertainment and education.Rating: Four stars (deducting one star for the volume/sound issues)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BY5GVPI" id="B00BY5GVPI-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-29:</strong> I ordered this because my husband likes to listen to Baseball games on AM Radio when doing yard work.

Jabra's packaging of their products always look good and is no different in this case.The TAG can be charged by USB or the included wall charger. Charging takes a bit less than 2 hours. Bluetooth pairing is easy and is done by pressing the multi-purpose button 4 seconds. Neither of my devices that I tried (iPod and smartphone) required a password.Instructions are poor. Neither the online pdf manual or supplied paper manual explained full usage of the unit, including what the colors of the LED meant. The online page indicated that there was a supplied USB charging cable which was not included.FM Radio: Minimalist design means no display so you just have to scan up and down to find your station and wait for an announcement to know what station you're at. The signal strength was strong for me and reception loud and clear.Earbuds: Fair, though they worked well enough, I didn't like their design. It's a matter of personal taste, but fortunately you can unplug the Jabra earbuds and put in your own.TAG: Very light and minimalistic. You can hang this around your neck or clip it to your collar. I'm not a fan of the minimalistic design and buttons that have more than one function without labels, but with trial and error you can pretty much figure everything out.Summary: Basically this is a wireless set of earbuds and controls that work with your phone or other bluetooth device. It includes a FM radio which in most cases will be redundant. It does everything it's supposed to do. I deducted 1 star because the earbuds weren't to my taste personally (I will use my own) and I didn't fancy the minimalist design. I think they should have put a small LCD display for the radio so you can at least see what station you're at.------------Update: November 2013.

I purchased a Jabra Street2 about a year ago - a very similar concept - because I wanted Bluetooth connectivity with my phone that allowed two things.  First, I wanted be able to use my own preferred headset and second, I wanted to not have a Bluetooth device parked next to my  brain for hours on end.  The Street2 accomplished these very well.I wanted to try the TAG because it added the convenience of FM stereo.  And I found the reception and stereo quality to be satisfactory.  Where the tag falls short is in the FM tuning and the headphone design.  Tuning is `blind' for lack of a better word - up and down arrows with no way to tell where on the `dial' you are currently tuned.  That makes changing to a particular station really frustrating and limits the usefullness of the FM feature.  As for the headphones, they are subpar in fit and sound quality for me, but they also make up the cord that hangs around your neck.  To use you own headphones, you give up the hanging feature and clipping it to your clothes becomes the only option.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BY5GVPI" id="B00BY5GVPI-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-08:</strong> I ride a motorcycle (a loud Harley) and use bluetooth units to listen to my gps and music while riding.

My hearing fidelity is not great, but I am pleased with the TAG's audio quality for both phone conversations and listening to music (and other audio media). The battery life has been good, and my experience matches the item's description of approximately eight hours of regular use between charges. The TAG is lightweight, clips to my shirt, stays in place during my workout, and it provides quality audio while I am jumping around like an idiot.

It works right out of the box, easy to setup, and recognizes bluetooth devices well enough, but the sound quality is subpar, and the included earphones are flat out lame.This set promotes stereo sound, use with other headphones, connecting to two bluetooth devices simultaneously, and having 8 hours of talk time.  I connected the device to my iPhone and bluetooth enabled TV speaker simultaneously without any problems.  I would say the battery life is very accurate as well.  I took it to work with me, and it lasted past my 8 hour shift.  The sound with the mic is very reliable and effective like most Jabra products I've used.  It does an excellent job of knocking out extraneous noise, and focuses on the voice at hand.I'm not thrilled with the headphones at all.  The cord is way too short, and the sound is about as weak as possible.  I guess if you only plan to listen to audio books and speaking events, this MIGHT be enough for you, but even then 60 dollars is a stretch.  It promotes that you can use other headphones with the 3.5 mm jack which is fine, but when you're buying a bluetooth device shouldn't the headphones be of a higher quality?  Also, do people actually listen to FM radio anymore?  Assuming you do, the FM "dial" on the front isn't digital and has no read out, so you've got no idea where your tuning is happening.This is a pretty simple, lower-end bluetooth headset that, if 30 dollars, would be worth your money and time.  But due to the 60 dollar price tag it's hard to recommend a bluetooth set with some of the worst headphones I've ever used with extremely limited features.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BY5GVPI" id="B00BY5GVPI-review23" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-25:</strong> I once owned a previous generation of this product -- but the bluetooth range was limited to about three feet and the stereo audio consistently cut out with my iPhone -- so it was near useless.Fast forward to 2013, and Jabra has managed a ~20 foot line-of-sight bluetooth range and within short distances the audio never cuts out. Powering the device on/off is easy and straightforward, just like changing the volume or track and pausing the audio. My iPhone also shows the battery life of the device right on the screen -- the 7 hours of music/talk time seems reasonable and attainable.Where I dock the product a star: Poor quality earphones included. They didn't fit my ears well so I just decided to use my own earphones -- but you lose the "necklace" feature and the plastic clip substitute is of low quality. I would like to assume that most folks are buying this product to use their own headphones -- a unique characteristic of this bluetooth receiver, but it's probably not the case. I used some high end Ultimate Ears and found the quality to be pretty close to being plugged in directly to my phone -- biggest annoyance was a hiss during quieter moments. The FM radio is also just a worthless gimmick -- no idea what you're tuning to nor was I ever to get a clear signal I'd want to listen to. Lastly, the built-in microphone for calls is only OK for indoor use -- when I was walking outside on a mildly windy day the other party had difficulty hearing me.I have no issues with the verbal commands announced by the device or its beeps -- they seem pretty natural and not overly loud. Pairing is dead simple. The TAG uses a standard micro-USB charger for charging -- and a USB cable for computer connection and AC adapter are included -- a nice touch. You'll get a full charge in just a couple hours, which is pretty impressive to me.If you understand the limitations of the product AND are looking to use your own earphones, this seems to be a pretty good choice.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BY5GVPI" id="B00BY5GVPI-review24" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-22:</strong> This works like a charm.

I had never used a Jabra product before.  However I was pleasantly surprised.  The earbuds are comfortable and fit well - a lot of earbuds hurt or constantly need adjusting.  These are just right.  The sound quality of the earbuds is unexpectedly pretty good.  However, the quality of the FM radio is terrible - I don't know why they even bothered with it.  But since I didn't need it to listen to the radio, it wasn't actually a deal breaker for me.  I just use it to listen to the music/movies on and to talk on the phone.  The playback time is pretty good.  I went more than 4 hours without recharging.The Bluetooth worked great - it recognized my Samsung and I didn't have any problems making or taking calls. Now I can talk hands free and I don't have to wear the weird ear thing.Over all, the Jabra TAG Bluetooth Stereo Headset gets a B.  I subtracted "points" because I thought it was a little pricey and the radio didn't work all that great.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BY5GVPI" id="B00BY5GVPI-review26" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-25:</strong> While the sound is great when listening to music, I have a slight issue with the form factor...

Unfortunately, in my experience with the Jabra Tag, it was on par with the Jabra Play, which is to say a mild disappointment.I like the design of of the Tag - it feels pretty solid and would look cool under your shirt (I'm not a fan of those folks who'd wear this like a piece of jewelry). It feels sturdy enough for every day urban use.Configuration with my phone and iPad worked just fine. It's Bluetooth, and if there was pairing issues, I would have tossed this in the trash. The overall instructions for the Tag were weak and honestly you're better off trying to figure this out on your own. I liked the idea of having a FM tuner in the headphones, but with no display, you're left scanning to the next station and guessing. Not cool at all. Also, my TAG liked to absorb my fingerprints.The one thing I actually did like was the sound quality and the headphones. They had a fairly decent response and were clear and I could get them to a fairly loud volume without much distortion.After a few days with the Jabra TAG, I felt myself really missing mySony 1264-5582 MW600 Hi-Fi Wireless Headset with FM Radio - Retail Packaging - Blackheadphones that much more. And considering that they're around the same price or so than this, you're better off skipping the Jabra line completely.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BY5GVPI" id="B00BY5GVPI-review31" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-22:</strong> I love this little device.

Joining a relatively recent new class of audio accessories of minimalistic Bluetooth headsets that consist of nothing more than two earbuds tethered together by a short thin wire, this is Jabra's new similar offering.  It can be used as stereo earbuds to listen to audio from any Bluetooth-enabled device, as well as a cell phone headset.  This new class of dual-bud headsets offer the advantage that they can help the user hear better in noisy environments like airports, and are small enough to be rolled into a little ball and stuffed in your pocket or purse.However, given the advantages of such a product what did Jabra do with theirs?  They purposely made theirs bigger by adding a cheap plastic box that contains an FM radio.  FM radio?  In 2013?  Not content to take a good idea and mess it up, they chose to make the radio as cheesy as possible.  The sensitivity and sound quality are terrible and the only way to find radio stations is to keep pressing an up/down button until your find what you're looking for.Their illustration of the product is of it hanging around a cool young guy's neck like a necklace.  Except the little box doesn't look cool, it looks more like a medical monitoring device.  I seriously can't see a guy his age sporting a piece of plastic shaped like a dog tag.  And even a brief brush with your finger leaves messy fingerprints.  People will wonder if you ever showerSuch things aside, these are earbuds, so how do they fit and how do they sound?  The fit is actually quite comfortable.  While I usually use the medium-sized pads for most earbuds, for these the large size was more comfortable.  To their credit, the sound is better than expected.  When I tried them at first with the medium earpads they sounded kind of shallow.  The sound got worse with the small pads, but with the large pads blocking my entire ear canal the bass was on a par with some of the better earbuds I've used.The control box is minimalistic but features the ability to remove the earbuds and plug in (assumingly) any headphone with the right miniplug.  That could open some interesting possibilities.The only things I really didn't like was that the cord is the type that gets hopelessly tangled, and that the entire cord seems much too long.  I think that's because Jabra assumes some people will clip the "tag" to their belts.  They shouldn't have assumed that because the microphone is built into the dog tag, not the cord, so if worn on the waist every element of the design is totally negated.  If they had made a dog tag length loop to fit over your head plus a short cable to go from there to your ears the experience would have been much more pleasant.  And if they really wanted them to resemble dog tags, they should have stayed away from the cheesy cheap stainless steel plastic front panel.  Honestly 95 out 100 people won't get the dog tag allusion anyway.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BY5GVPI" id="B00BY5GVPI-review33" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-13:</strong> I was very excited to try the Jabra Tag.  It seemed to offer exactly what I wanted - the ability to skip/pause/play/adjust the value of music on my phone without actually interacting with the phone itself.  I wanted to use the Tag both at work and in the car.  I have an older car without bluetooth built in, so I needed something like the Tag to control my music while connected to the car's stereo.While the controls all work as expected, the sound quality is abysmal.  There is a steady hiss.  If the music is loud and steady enough, the noise is barely audible.  However, with quieter songs, there is no escaping the hiss.  I have tried adjusting the volume on the Tag, phone, and car.  Nothing remedies the hiss.  I have also tried a variety of headphones (you don't have to use the flimsy ones included with the Tag), thinking maybe the headphones were the problem, but to no avail.The Nokia BH-111 is another similar device, which I have used.  That device doesn't suffer from as much hiss, but has other faults that I also can't get passed.  My quest for the perfect bluetooth remote will continue I suppose.If you can somehow get passed the hissing sound, then this device is for you.  In terms of controlling your music with the device, it works as expected.  It also connected to my Nokia N9 with ease.  Lastly, it uses a regular USB charger, so you don't have to deal with a proprietary charger (as with the Nokia BH-111).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BY5GVPI" id="B00BY5GVPI-review34" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-24:</strong> The Jabra TAG is a sleek dog-tag style Bluetooth device for use with corded earphones. It's talent is the ability for you to control the music, podcast, or audio book you're listening to without having to fuss with your smartphone or tablet.So far I'm really liking the Jabra TAG enough to give it four stars. It has great features, but there are some annoyances that keep me from making it 5 stars.Let's check it out.EAR BUDS:The ear buds the TAG comes with are the noise-cancelling, plug in your ear type. The cord is shorter than the regular length and can be worn as a lanyard around your neck. It's nothing spectacular in sound quality. It works fine for what I enjoy most which is audio books and podcasts. However, for making phone calls, it's weird. The in-ear design makes my voice sound resound in my head loudly. The effect is loud and highly distracting. Luckily, the ear buds can be replaced with headphones of my choice. (This is what I did.)(The original ear buds are snugged in tightly with a clip. Gently lift the clip tags to release and properly pull the plug out. I only wish there was a way to keep that security clip with a different head set.)Unfortunately, by changing out the stock ear buds, you lose the ability to wear the TAG as a lanyard. An easy fix for this is using the Quirky Props ear bud tether (or make something similar on your own) will allow you to use you head set cord as a lanyard.3 Stars for the included ear buds. 4 Stars for allowing me to use my own headphones I prefer.CONTROLS:The Jabra TAG comes with a main, FF/REW, and radio buttons on the front. The Jabra main button is used to power on, connect, and pause. The second row is actually two buttons on either side of a long bar. These control the forward/backward commands. The bottom is radio. On the side is two circular buttons for in-device volume control.The front buttons are long slender raised bars. I think they are a  little too slender.  Sometimes the first press doesn't always register. Wider buttons would've been appreciated and less aggravating to use.  3 StarsRADIO:A nice feature that I rarely use since I hardly listen to the radio anymore. The one thing I noticed is that the signal gets fuzzy at times just moving around. Controlling the radio with the slim buttons requires a small learning curve.  3 Stars.MIC:The mic is what surprised me so far. It filters out loud extraneous sources. I have rubbed, hit, tapped, slapped, knocked on the device and on the mic input during test recording on my PC.  None of that noise was picked up. Only my voice on the recording. (I tried this same test with an inline mic on a different headphone, and it picked up everything. It was harsh.) This makes me confident that regardless what the TAG does or is attached to, it will only record my voice and not the sound of it hitting my chest while exercising, rustling in my pocket, or rubbing on a shirt collar or jacket. This feature gets 5 stars from me.VOICE PROMPTS:There's a voice prompt warning you of the battery status, device connection, and power. It seems that the voice prompts work on a different and very LOUD volume apart from whatever you're listening to. The prompts are helpful, the loudness of them can be annoying. 3 Stars.SUMMARY:Despite the 3-star ratings for many of the features, I rather enjoy the Jabra TAG as a whole. It's become my Bluetooth device of choice for when I listen to podcasts, music, or audio books on my smartphone because it gives me easy control of the content. It also gives me very good phone quality for the occasional call that comes in. (I do not use the included ear buds by Jabra; I replaced those with a set of my own that I prefer better.) I've been very pleased with the Jabra TAG overall. 4 Stars.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BY5GVPI" id="B00BY5GVPI-review35" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-25:</strong> Setting this up was easy and fast with my Bluetooth enabled devices.I live in a non-crowded radio area- or at least my favorite stations are in non-crowded spots on the dial so this tunes in just fine for me. I'm pretty spoiled though from using high end headphones for listening to music and these sound cheap and flat compared to those. You can switch out the headphones, which is what I wound up doing.This works well for phone calls, and for laptop applications. Decent mic pickup and background noise suppression.So why is it only decent? Because the "sleek design" isn't actually comfortable or easy to wear. It seems almost like something for kids rather than a headset for adults. If you tuck it into a shirt, the mic pick up doesn't work well, if you have it out, it's awkward and in the way more than you'd expect. The headphones cords aren't quite long enough to clip it in a shirt pocket, and it's too big to be comfortable clipped in the collar of a shirt.In the end, it works best for me when I'm sitting still working on my laptop rather than using it with my phone. If it were just 2 inches longer or if the tag had a better shape for clipping to a shirt collar, I'd have given it 4 stars. But as it's designed, it's just not quite there. This works best with other headphones/earbuds.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BY5GVPI" id="B00BY5GVPI-review36" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-28:</strong> The primary reason I use a Bluetooth stereo headset is for music.  While the sound was plenty loud on the TAG, the quality of sound was just mediocre for music, I was not impressed at this price.  I did not try different ear buds with the device.One thing that surprised me was that normal speaking voices (example, people talking on podcasts) sounded very natural.  Actually, for people speaking, the TAG was better than a pair of much nicer Bluetooth earphones I have. Perhaps this is due to the fact that this is a Jabra product and they have a lot of technological know-how in Bluetooth cell phone headsets where sound quality of voices matter a lot.Other details...- The TAG has a nice battery long life.  I also like that it is easy to charge with a micro USB cable.- The FM radio is not very useful, the reception wasn't great and blindly searching for stations with no indication of what channel I was on was frustrating.  However, I would not consider this product for FM, so not an issue for me.- The ability to hang this around your neck, or put in your pocket, or clip to your shirt is all nice, but feels like Jabra is making a bigger deal of this simple feature than I would have.Overall...  the TAG does not deliver quality sound for music</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BY5GVPI" id="B00BY5GVPI-review37" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-15:</strong> At this price point the Jabra TAG is a decent buy.  This model has a nice audio intro telling you how to pair it to your device which is a nice bonus to the less tech savvy people looking to go wireless.  For making calls it has adequate sound clarity and functional design for ease of use.  Where it isn't so great is perhaps in some of its extended uses.  The ear buds aren't all that great so it isn't a headset I'd use for sports/exercise given that I had them popping out just lounging around the house nor is it a great headset for things like music due to a pretty lackluster sound quality in that particular arena.  Still, not too shabby for the price.  Might be worth it to invest in a better pair for more rounded use but if you simply need a hands-free solution for a phone it's a pretty good buy.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BY5GVPI" id="B00BY5GVPI-review38" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-22:</strong> There is a new wave of wireless bluetooth headset devices hitting the market. this year.  If you have ever snagged a headset cable on furniture or your hand and either ruined a headset or the device it's attached to, you will understand the need.  If you ever went running and dropped your MP3 player and yanked your earphones out then you see the need for these.  But like any new technology there are tradeoffs.  Battery life, audio quality and device size seem to be the tradeoff here.  Battery life is ok with this bluetooth set but  at the expense of a large ckunky pendent then the earphones plug into.  For some odd reason the earphones that come with the Jabra Tag are unusually cheap and sound horrible.  You can plug in other earphones and the sound improves considerably.  Unfortunately the large pendant is so big it almost negates the benefits of wireless bluetooth.  Worse yet,  the FT receiver on these is low quality, has poor range and you have no way of seeing what frequency you are tuned to.[PROS][+] Easy to pair to bluetooth[+] Decent battery life[+] Good volume adjuster[CONS][-] Big[-] Cheap poor sounding  earphones[-]  Weak FM[-] Difficult to use FM Receiver</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BY5GVPI" id="B00BY5GVPI-review39" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-08:</strong> I haven't found many bluetooth earbuds that also support listening to FM radio.

While multi-port chargers are easily found, this is the first one I&#8217;ve come across that has on/off switches for each port. For me, that&#8217;s a great feature since I can leave the device plugged in and just turn off that particular port on the charger rather than have to disconnect the device (I have some older devices that don&#8217;t automatically turn off when fully charged, so they need to be disconnected to prevent overcharging).It&#8217;s pretty compact considering there are 5 USB ports available. It measures about 4.5 inches long and 1.5 inches wide. The build quality feels decent, and the port plug (the cable you plug into your cigarette lighter) is firmly attached. The plug fit into the lighter socket very well and stayed in place.The charger comes with a small piece of Velcro tape if you want to mount the charger on (or under) your dash. I didn't need to do that since the 3 foot cord allowed me to put the charger on the passenger seat, but it&#8217;s a nice touch that it was included.Each port has it&#8217;s own on/off button and a LED indicator to show that it&#8217;s powered on. The max output is 8A (40watts). I didn't notice any heat build-up when charging two phones and a tablet.Nice design and a great choice if you want something that you can turn off the charging by pushing a button rather than have to disconnect the device.[Sample provided for review]</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090R3Y34" id="B0090R3Y34-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-02:</strong> This is truly an amazing USB Car Charger.

For one thing, not all vehicles are going to be able to effectively provide 40 Watts through a lighter socket. This charging strip will intelligently distribute current in a manner that will protect your devices. Do note that most modern vehicles like my 2014 Outlander can, but my old 2008 Mazda 3 would have literally blown a fuse. This is not a problem with the charger, but advice to check the rated capacity of your vehicle's lighter socket before purchasing this strip.Another feature that I love is while each port can go to 2.1 volts, the internal circuit is intelligent enough to sense and adjust the charging rate for most devices.This is clearly designed for family use and it excels because five ports in such a small form factor is convenient. Many cars have lighter sockets in the center console as well as under the dash, and this plugged into the console socket is an ideal location for serving passengers in the back seat as well as the driver and front seat passenger. I did not bother to use the included velcro strip that attaches to the back of this unit and a smooth point in your vehicle with adhesive. However, if you want to secure it in a fixed location that strip is a nice bonus feature.Bottom line: this is the perfect solution for carpools, large families or even a single driver who carries around two phones, a tablet and sometimes a passenger who also has gadgets.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090R3Y34" id="B0090R3Y34-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-25:</strong> The EZOPower 8 amp/40 watt 5 USB car charger is a must have for those who want to be able to charge many devices simultaneously in a car.This car charger has a cable that goes from the car outlet to the USB charger unit.

I really like this car charger and I plan to use a lot so I don&#8217;t have to fight for a car outlet with my family.It comes with a Velcro strip to place it to a part of a car.Overall this is one of my favorite car chargers.

I got mine from Docooler, so perhaps that's why I got a good one-- but then again, I ordered another through an electronics bargain website that turned out to be identical, so maybe not.Four stars because I've literally only had the thing for three days (and have only had a Qi capable phone for like, six) so who knows how it'll hold up. But for now, I can't restrain myself and must review this magical piece of equipment.I mean, Qi charging has been around for a while, but I guess it's only recently starting down the road toward ubiquity. I was one of those &#34;that seems relatively pointless&#34; types, especially when one had to buy an expensive charging mat and then a case for their phone that would make it work and that all just seemed quite silly to me. But then I got a phone for which Qi is native (Nexus 5), and figured if I could get a charging plate for a reasonable price I'd give it a go. Glad I did.If you work at a desk most of the time, chances are you put your phone on your desk a lot. You probably even put it in the same spot a lot. I know I do. But you probably don't charge it a lot, because putting that mircoUSB plug into the micro port on your phone is an amount of effort you just aren't going to go to. Not that it's HARD, or even terribly time consuming, but it's effort, and if your phone can reasonably make it through the day without charging, why would you put that effort in? Silly.Welp, if you put this (variably priced but let's say) $12) piece of plastic on your desk and run a cable to the floor and ignore it forever and ever, you can turn that spot you put your phone down on anyway into a spot that makes your battery be at 100% (or very nearly) at the end of the work day.Seriously. I have used my phone no less today than a normal day. A little texting, some internetting at lunch, a picture or two, etc. I used it to stream music during my 30 minute commute this morning. Usually I leave the day with 50-60%, tops. It's 5:15 and I'm at... I just flipped over to 99%. And I have definitely not had it on the charger all day... maybe half the day? Intermittently, too. The charge comes just as quickly, so far as I can tell, as it would from a cable. I am not using any monitoring devices, though, just my sense as an everyday user.Getting the N5 to begin charging is nothing. If the charge on the phone is under about 93% when you put it on, the screen will light up and the phone will make a noise (unless it's on silent). **If the charge on your phone is over approximately 93% when you put it on the charger it will not make a noise!!!!** But it's still charging (based on the icon on the screen of the phone), so no worries.I will update on the longevity of this thing at a later date, but right now, I'm madly in love with Qi charging, and it's all because of this pad.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F5STILY" id="B00F5STILY-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-27:</strong> If you are a Motorola Droid fan the Mini and Maxx allow for wireless charging. I initially purchased a different charging pad and found precise placement was essential. Sometimes charging would stop mid-cycle if the phone was a little off center. The Docooler pad is far more forgiving; I can drop-and-go and have confidence my device will be fully charged in the morning. Looks nicer too IMO. The red/green LEDs are not excessively bright but could bother some in a dark room. Heat has not been a problem. I have a TPU case but that that does not seem to impeded detection or charging. A great pad overall - at least for the phones noted above.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F5STILY" id="B00F5STILY-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-03:</strong> Yes, it is that light weight.  Don't be surprised when you receive the package that it literally feels like you bought nothing!  The unit itself is very light and keep in mind that you do NOT get a power adapter with it.You get the QI charging pad and a micro USB cable.  The manufacture assumes that you will be using the one that came with your phone or device.I did find, however that the USB cable that it came with a little flaky.  It doesn't lock into the charging base securely.  I found it seemed a little loose and finicky.  Nudge it the wrong way, and it would stop powering the charging pad.  All was resolved if I used a different micro USB cable.  Another niggly issue is that the USB port on the charging mat is at the bottom.  I think it would have been better if it were at the top.  It would make things a little neater and cleaner having the port at the top as the cable wouldn't have to come around the pad to the bottom.Update - I took a closer look at the micro USB side of the cable and I noticed it is actually shorter than other micro USB cables.  That is why when the supplied cable is inserted into the QI charging pad (or any other micro USB port), it seems a little "loose" and "insecure".I took a utility knife and cut off about a millimeter or two of the plastic case off.  The plastic is soft enough to be scored and cut fairly easily.  VOILA!  A much more secure fit.Also, the USB cable is NOT a data cable.  It is only a charging cable.  The "data pins" of this USB cable are shorted together so when an Android device is plugged into it and the other end is plugged into a computer, it shows up as "AC charging".  The Android device is not recognized by the computer at all.  Using the cable to charge the phone (or used to power the pad) is perfectly fine though.  Just don't expect to do any data transfers to/from a micro USB device with this cable.I'm still leaving this review at 3 stars, only because of the hassle of trimming of the USB cable end.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F5STILY" id="B00F5STILY-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-13:</strong> Granted I have the 'fonesalesman' Qi charger in the phone so that may not work right. Or perhaps this charger doesn't work with my phone. It seems to want to work but after leaving my phone on it all night long the battery was down to 79%. Plus it feels very light, so it moves around too easily when trying to position the phone on it. I do like the velvet-like surface and it might work well for some phones, plus the price is right.

It charges just fine through the case. I used the wall adapter that came with the Nexus 5 to plug into this charger.It works great. I wish the red LED was not on all the time, but the green LED that tells when charging is happening is handy. These LEDs are not overly bright, so they won't keep you awake at night.The pad itself is slightly larger than the phone. This is nice because you aren't caught doing a balancing act trying to get the phone to charge. It doesn't have alignment magnets like other smaller chargers. These help with alignment but for this price and size of pad I don't see the need for it.I haven't noticed the phone getting overly warm during charging. I can't say that I have even noticed the phone getting a little warm while charging.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F5STILY" id="B00F5STILY-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-25:</strong> I had a Nokia qi which I returned.

I ordered it before the first one failed because I was so delighted with the first one.  BUT... after two weeks, the first one broke.  I had already ordered this one and it was too late to cancel.  So... I pried open the broken one and saw that the micro USB port had fallen off its mountings. I do not solder so there was no way to fix.Oh and the first one came with a bad USB cable but I have a house full so that wasn't a biggie.Once you get a working USB cable, the device actually charges my Nexus 5 way more easily than the $50 charger I bought (and gave to my brother).  It takes no fiddling - just toss it on the pad and bam, you are in business.  (I always had to position the phone very carefully to ensure charge on the expensive one.)This time, the minute the new one arrived, I first tested the cable... worked fine.  Then I broke open a pack of Sugru (sugru.com) and affixed the cable onto the charger so that it won't wiggle or come out - hopefully, ever.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F5STILY" id="B00F5STILY-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-18:</strong> WATCH OUT FOR SLOW SHIPPING!Amazon Prime might spoil you, so watch out for the 17-28 business days that this puts on the order confirmation page.

It only took about 3 days to arrive with the free shipping so that was pretty fast. When I first got it the first thing I did was pop out the screen protector and put an SGP anti glare one on and it was pretty much perfect. The ports are easy to access even if you don't have big fingernails. The buttons are responsive which is a plus. It has good drop protection which is why most people are looking to buy this. The apple is cut out so people know that you have an iPhone and it may bother you but personally it doesn't bother me. The camera cut out is big and it won't cause any problems with the flash. This color would look better on a white phone because it pretty much matches the iPhone 5's color. Overall if you're on the fence about buying it it would be worth it. $30 is a good deal on how much drop protection you get and it still lets your phone look good even though it might be a little bit thick.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-14:</strong> I bought this case for both my wife and I, thinking we needed the best protection we could get.

I bought a Otter Box in store for the normal $50 some dollars. I'm not seeing anything in the description stating it is fake, as they do have the official pictures and videos along with shipment comes with what looks to be official boxing, papers inside and all. Looking between my $50 otter box case and this one there are a few difference. It is made in a different country, the grip portion seems to not be put together as well on the edges and the hard case (main reason I bought it cause the color) the top part seems as though it almost doesn't fit. The top left doesn't snap together which isn't a issue once you put on the rubber case as it holds it down. All in all it seems like it does the job the otter box should but I don't believe it is real.If your looking for a official Otter Box, I would suggest buying it from their site or at a store.Also when I bought my case at the store, numerous people told that the ones bought on amazon, people have had issues getting parts replaced because the model # is a fake. But I will update if any issues occur while using it as I just put it on today.Shipping: I'm a prime member and it stated free 2 day shipping.

When I received it(very fast by the way), I was equally impressed by the actual product in my hands.  I'm not too worried about it not being waterproof(non-submersible) as I am very careful with all the cellphones I've ever owned anyway.  But, I'm sure it will protect the phone in the rain as long as you don't let it get soaked.  As far as impact protection, this case will definitely provide enough protection as long as you don't intentionally slam it into the pavement.  The holster is really handy for clipping it to your vehicle's sun visor or fastening to your belt or back pack strap.  One of my favorite features is the built in screen protector - it really doesn't interfere with the touch sensitivity of the phone.  I've purchased other OtterBox products and have never been disappointed.  So, I would recommend the Defender Series case to anyone looking for a high quality, protective, fully functional case for their iphone 5.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-29:</strong> this Otterbox defender is the exact same thing as Verizon and Walmart want 50 bucks for. I ordered it on Thursday and it came the following Monday. If you own an I phone 5 then protect your investment with 1 of these. The belt clip has changed since the iPhone 4 but it is an improvement. Those who say it is not the same are wrong. I compared mine to the 1 my son bought for 50 bucks at Verizon and they are identical. It is the same box, the same quality, and identical to in every way to the 1 he paid 30 bucks more for. If you can't wait 4 days then go ahead and waste your money. Needless to say I had an Otterbox on my iPhone 4 and when I traded it in Verizon they gave me the maximum allowance because it was protected so well that it looks like new. I don't know who is writing that these are not genuine products because they are. Buy 1 and you will be glad you did. As far as I know these are the best protection for an iPhone 5 that is available at this time. Fred Tafter I had the OtterBox for several months I managed to scratch up the cover to where I needed a new protection screen. I called OtterBox to purchase one and they informed me that they were guaranteed for life. I told them it was not a product problem but something caused by me and I just wanted to buy a new screen and they would not hear of it, all they asked for was a picture of the damaged one be posted on their warranties website and they immediately sent me a brand new OtterBox. If it was fake they wouldn't have done that.  just an update.

The screen protector on the front of the phone is not as bad as the LifeProof cases I've had in the past. By not as bad I mean that there isn't as much of a gap between the actual phone and screen protector on the otterbox.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review31" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-12:</strong> 5 star case yes its a little big and yes a little heavy but its one good looking case.protection the best but it got this case for it looks and it has class I'm not one of those people that protect things like I never had anything before.so if you want good looks good and has protection this is it.I also own 2 others and one broke there customer service is the best.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review32" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-16:</strong> I thought this case would be a 'can't miss' quality product.Otterbox has apparently developed a reputation for producing a quality product which provides the ultimate in protection. While I have no doubt that this case offers as much protection as any product at this price point, it fails in three very important criteria.1. Esthetics.I purchased the plain black case, which looks reasonably nice in the photos in the item description. Unfortunately, the actual case itself is just plain ugly. Forget about ever seeing the iphone 5's sleek lines. Those are replaced and covered by an enormous case defined by random, large bulbous rubber knobs which serve no purpose whatsoever aside from making the case look hideous.2. FunctionalityThe size of the case and the amount of material used are completely excessive for the case's intended use: protecting the phone in normal, everyday use. As a result, the phone's functionality is severely compromised. First, typing is absolutely laborious. Instead if being able to lay your hands flat, or allowing the outside of your hand to tilt downward a bit as one types, both hands (and therefore one's arms and shoulders) are all forced to tilt unnaturally in an upward direction. This is because the lip of the case is so huge, you have to raise the outside of your hands upwards to clear the case's raised edges.Also, the screen protector, as others have noted, doesn't quite touch the screen, like standard protectors which adhere to the screen. The tolerances are so poor for this item that you must press down on the screen protector to actually use the screen itself. This obviously creates lag and slop with any motion. Furthermore, screen brightness is compromised as a result of the screen protector. Sure, you could pop the protector out, but you should be able to use the product as is; it's unfortunate that an important feature of the case has to be removed in order to use the screen with any reasonable degree of sensitivity and accuracy.Third, the port cover is a simple rubber plug which presses upward against your power cable whenever it's plugged into the phone. A hinge would have added a moving part and hence increased the risk of breakage, but with a simple flap, there is a chance of the port being loosened over time as the port cover presses upward against the cable.I could go on and on but these are the most serious functional deficiencies I've been able to note so far.BulkEven when you're not using the phone, the case makes it's presence known. Your phone will be quite heavy with this case when you stow it in a pocket. The case is actually too thick to put into a jeans pocket comfortably if you wear slim jeans, and of course it's enormous size is impractical regardless whenever you sit unless you happen to be wearing oversized, mc hammer style pants. I've been keeping the phone with case in a coat pocket. The coat sags unceremoniously on the side where the phone is stored.One note on build quality: the secondary, outer portion of the case is made of a hard rubber compound. Ugly, but effective in protecting the phone from drops. I am less than pleased however, with the choice of hard plastic for the inner case which cocoons the phone itself. The inside of the case should have been rubberized, or covered with felt to protect the phone's casing. Also there are lots of sharp edges everywhere on the outside of this case. Very unsightly. Not what I expected from a major brand.ConclusionYes, this case offers excellent protection. Unfortunately, you can't enjoy using the phone itself as it was meant to be used as a result of the excessive bulk, size and design of the case. The choice of materials, clunky build quality, and very poor esthetics are major demerits.The iphone has been around for a while, so I am really surprised that a well known and respected brand like otterbox can make such stupid decisions in their design and still sell so many cases.Let's face it, there's no point in buying a case if it is both ugly to look at as well as serving as a major hindrance to the easy/ease of use of the phone itself.I can't wait for my new case to arrive. I feel like I made a mistake by purchasing the otterbox. Fortunately, it looks like I've found a great alternative...Otterbox, you broke my heart...YOU BROKE MY HEART.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review33" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-19:</strong> The otterbox is always a WinWiN situation...can't go wrong!!!

Even though this review is under the heading "black case", it's not limited to that version.One of my five must have been a super-early version of the OD because the outer skin was a stretchy silicone - loose fit, tacky and a lint collector. I didn't like it at all.  Also, this earlier version allowed the iPhone to slip slightly within the case - the non-skid rubber inside the hard plastic back was slick and not as thick as the later versions. I pushed out the screen protector to use my own, which may have allowed the slipping but I'm not sure on that. I got rid of this one.Each of the remaining four have been outstanding in every way. The all have the newer rubber-base, sleek outer cover with just enough texture to provide a solid grip. Honestly, I haven't had most of the issues detailed in many of the reviews here. I have used it with the built-in screen protector (with and without another screen protector underneath) and without the built-in screen protector (just the one I had on before I got the OD). I never had the rainbow effect, but I DID make really sure the iPhone screen AND the inside of the OD screen protector were perfectly clean.I prefer my own screen protector because the built-in one (especially when it's over another screen protector) doesn't have the quick response. It works, but not as responsive as my own. Also, I did pick up a slight separation between the built-in protector and the screen when there was not another protector underneath. It was very minor, and I likely wouldn't have noticed it if I hadn't read others' comments on this. It wasn't a deal breaker.The fit has been snug and consistent. The Apple logo is centered in the little window on the back. The edges around the screen don't get in the way of using the screen at all, nor does the raised area over the home button.  A bonus I've found is the power port cover eliminates the tendency of my iPhone 5 mic to have feedback or echoes for some callers. That power port cover does NOT interfere with how I sound to callers - they can't tell if they are on speaker or if I'm holding it. I do keep the mic relatively nearby when on speaker, though.I've read in the forums that there are a lot of knock-off ODs out there and I'm wondering if some of the issues mentioned in these reviews might stem from these versions. I understand it's really hard to tell the difference without a close scrutiny. I strongly recommend the (real) Otterbox Defender for iPhone 5. It certainly beefs up the iPhone 5 by adding significant weight and size, but the overall result is positive. I actually like the additional bulk. For some reason, it just feels good to hold, not to mention the main reason for using it - the high level of protection.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review35" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-27:</strong> I have dropped my phone several times since I purchased this case and my phone doesn't have a single scratch or mark, it still looks like new!

I like the commuter series. But my wife seems to drop hers more so the Defender series works well. This is markedly improved from the Defender series for the iPhone 4. Possibly because the iPhone 5 is thinner it allowed Otterbox more options for design. But I like that the rim around the screen is raised on all sides with a nice slope on the top and bottom. The front and back camera holes are excellent, flash photos come out great. The speaker cutouts are great and you get very secure protection for the volume mute slide and the power connector.I also like the Defender series because it is very 'gripy' and makes the phone pleasing to hold. If you are OK with the added size, especially in width and extra weight, this is an excellent choice. Everyone has different wants and desires. If your desire is well-designed protection this is a great option. It also seems the most spot-on Otterbox I have seen, everything is placed exactly right.

I give this product a high rating because not only does it provide a solid case that that is well engineered, but it is well priced, and provides an added level of screen protection that is appreciated.My iPhone 5 was dropped out of my pocket while mountain biking, then run over a few times before i noticed... Needless to say, my phone screen was cracked  and spider webbed on the bottom half. It even had a sizable glass chunk missing... This case helps by providing a built in layer of screen protection that now basically serves as the touch screen to my device. It allows me utilize the functions of my phone once again, almost as if there were no cracks at all!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review43" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-13:</strong> I love otterbox in general, however the clip that arrived with the otterbox doesn't seem to fit properly, so when it is used it tears at the side of the otterbox, leaving jagged edges and tares.

Are they bulky, yep.  Are they sturdy, heck yes.  Will they protect your device if it falls down a flight of stairs or onto concrete etc... ABSOLUTELY!Obviously, one should expect trade off's when you are trying to protect a sleek and minimalist design like an iPhone.  When you wrap it up in armor, it's going to have to cover all that up to ensure it survives whatever it is that you and your life are going to throw at it.  I purchased this for my wife who just upgraded to an iPhone 5s.  She is on the go all the time and we have two children who love to help themselves to our devices when they can.  I know that wrapping this up in the cocoon that is an Otterbox Defender it's going to survive a long long time.Now, this is the iPhone 5 version of the Otterbox Defender and I purchased this model on purpose.  Personally, I don't care to use TouchID and having the case wrap up over the bottom of the phone with a silicone cover over the button is a much better value than a gimmicky fingerprint reader in my opinion.  For phone security, I will continue to use a secure (more than 4 digit) pin.  If TouchID is a feature that you can't live without, do NOT buy this case.  You will be disappointed.The cut-out in the back for the camera and flash is large enough to accommodate the new double flash which is an upgrade over the iPhone 5.  The front cut-out, volume + -, mute, lightning connector, and audio out jack are all carried over from the 5, so they line up just fine as well.The overall fit of the Defender is perfect.  The phone sits snugly in the stiff plastic core which snaps together prior to the application of the rubberized sleeve which adds impact protection around the back and sides of your device.  Having come from Samsung Galaxy S3's, I like the overall fit of the iPhone case vs what I experienced with my Galaxy (also in a Defender case).  Speaking of perfection, dealing with Otterbox, on the very few times I have needed to, has always been a pleasure.  Customer service is attentive and seems to be US based.  I had issues with the silicone stretching and no longer maintaining a strong fit.  A phone call, 2 pictures and an email reply were all that it took to get a replacement sent out (at their expense) to get me back on track.  This kind of service (and fantastic real world protection) are what keep me coming back to Otterbox to protect my devices whenever I upgrade.The biggest detraction from this (and any Defender case) in my opinion is the built in screen protection.  I have a problem with any screen protection mounted to a case because it's simply impossible to keep dust, lint, pocket fuzz, moisture, etc from getting between the phone and the protector.  Once you get anything in there you have to take the whole thing apart, clean everything thoroughly and then put it back together.  Depending on how you carry your phone, this could be required multiple times a day and who has time for that??  The solution, I find, is to use a third party screen protection (Zagg or other) which is applied directly to the phone (or tablet) itself.  Once you have this protection in place, the built in screen protection isn't needed and can be removed.  Once this is completed, put the phone in the case and button it all up and viola'!  Complete phone protection and a screen that won't fall prey to dust and debris build up!**Summary**I've used Otterbox Defender's on Blackberry, Android, iPhone and iPad's and have never been disappointed with the product or the service that I have received.  This is why I continue to seek them out for myself and my family when new devices come into our household.  If I am going to buy it in the first place, I want to make sure it stands a good chance of SURVIVING an active household with KIDS. :)**UPDATE 12/26/13**I ordered as second Defender for my 5s to have as a backup.  My current primary case is the uNu DX which is a fantastic, battery backup case which provides a complete charge via the enclosed battery pack.  There have been some users that report issues with those cases after a few months.  As a power user who depends on my phone, should something happen to my current case, I need a backup to transition to while waiting for an RMA replacement.  I know the Otterbox defender won't let me down, and if you shop the sales here at Amazon you can grab one for a song.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review45" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-10:</strong> If you did not know what it is like to hold a naked iPhone, you would think that it was made with this OtterBox Defender Case.

These covers also need periodic replacement. Henry ford said you could buy the Model T in any color as long as it is black.

Others, were supposedly able to withstand ANYTHING, but really didn't do much of anything they promised.I was leery, because I had heard that the otterbox for iphone 4 was not that  good, but that they had made great improvements on the iphone 5 otterbox.Well, it was worth a shot.  I wasn't disappointed!  It fit like a glove!  I personally didn't like the plastic cover, so I pushed it out, got rid of it, and had a friend put a High DEF zagg protector on the glass.  WOW, it looks sharp now!  I would not have a zagg protector AND keep the plastic in as well.  I have seen too many complaints of how it looks when you tap the screen.I just recommend you open and clean your iphone 5 every few weeks or so just in case you get something in the case-after all, none of the cases are completely foolproof!

I have 2 young kids and am an avid camper so protecting my devices from sticky hands, dust and drops is more important than sleek looks.PROS-  The case offers good impact protection.-  The case seemed big at first but now seems normal after a week.-  Fits in the back pocket of my jeans - real jeans, not skinny ones.-  The case protrudes enough on front and back that it should protect your device if liquid were to be spilled around it.CONS- The screen protector kept sticking to the screen producing what others are calling a watermark effect.  It is horribly annoying.  I followed online suggestions to use Windex and newspaper to clean the phone and screen protector and it fixed the issue.  That said, the news paper/Windex did scratch-up the screen protector.  Lame.- I stuck the phone into the included belt clip and it started to tear the rubber casing on the phone.  Won't be using the clip anymore!- If you have really short finger nails than you may have trouble opening the flap to the phone silence button on the side. I have to use my keys.  The covers on the bottom are easier to flip open because of the speaker/mic holes.I think Otterbox could have done a better job on this case.  It's not bad if you absolutely need the protection but I recommend getting something else if you don't need your case to be bomb proof.I hope this review is useful to you.UPDATE 1/28/2013Otterbox is so nice to deal with.  They have sent me a new case and claim that they have resolved the "watermark issue" by applying a new material to their screen protector.  They also said that if you have an existing case to NOT use Windex or newspaper to get rid of the watermarking and to use baby powder instead.  They said to gently apply to screen of iPhone and to inside of screen protector - gently wipe away so you can't see anymore and then install the case. Also, the case really is very resistant to drops.UPDATE 1/31/2013Otterbox sent me a new case and the design has been slightly modified to prevent the water mark issue.  The good news is that there is no more water marks.  The bad news is that the built in screen protector no longer lays on the iPhone so there is a small air pocket between them.  It feels horrible.  Each time you press down on the screen you connect with the protector and then your finger must continue pushing down until it makes contact with the iPhone.  My wife said it "wasn't horrible" but i think it's pretty bad.  I have purchased a UAG case and plan on only using my Otterbox for camping trips.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review66" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-03:</strong> After I made my iPhone 4 explode, I knew that I would feel much safer with an Otterbox Defender for my iPhone 5.

The "newer Iphone 5s Defender case" has to cut out a exposed hole around the lower home button to allow for "finger print recognition" and since the screen protector sits a mm above the screen, you'll get lots of dust underneath.If, like me, you don't like the cluncky Defender belt clip with it's big levers and "snap in" routine, there's an excellent leather belt clip holder from Reiko that will hold the Iphone 5, 5s with the Defender case in place:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FN919QM/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1Enjoy.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review76" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-29:</strong> I got this because I am a klutz & drop my phone all the time.

It comes with a built in screen protector. You really can't ask for much more when it comes to protecting your precious device from falls, nicks, scratches and dings. The only down side is the form factor. It does make your iPhone a lot more bulky. I did not use the belt holster that came with it. I tend to carry my phone in my pocket. Because of the heft of this case, I eventually got a slim case from Rearth Ringke and installed a glass screen protector.

I had a flimsy one but I knew I needed something more protective. I was interested in the Otterbox because I previously had one for my iPhone 4 and absolutely loved it because it offered so much protection. For Christmas I was fortunate enough to get one as a present from my family and I immediately put it on my phone. Although there are other protective phone cases, I wanted the Otterbox because of my past experience with the product and reviews from friends and family. I'm more than happy with my experience so far.There are a couple different Otterbox designs you can choose from. There is the Commuter series and the Defender series all that have many color schemes to choose from. All I've ever bought is the Defender series as this one offers the most protection. I have the pink and white one.  This case has two different layers that offer the best protection. The first layer you put on the phone is the hard shell. The hard shell completely covers the majority of the phone except the buttons and ports. There is a built in screen protector which is nice. The next layer is a silicone stretchy layer. This layer goes over the hard shell and covers all buttons and ports.The buttons are easy to push with the silicone covering.When the time comes to charge the phone it is fairly easy to unplug the lightning port for the charging cable. The same goes for the headphone jack. There is also a covering for the volume jack. As I have said before, all these silicone coverings are very easy to remove. I haven't had any problems with the case so far. The phone is very thin so putting on the Otterbox definitely makes it bulkier, but I've been able to get use to it. I'm also very clumsy and will drop my phone on accident once in a while. There has been no harm done to my phone. I can't even imagine what I would do if I didn't have the Otterbox.If you are any kind of business worker and like to have your phone by your side the case comes with a holster that attaches to your pants or wherever. The phone easily connects and is easily removed. With the iPhone 4, I was easily able to put the phone in my back pocket with the Otterbox on, but I've realized with the iPhone 5, it's much harder to fit in my pockets so I use my purse when needed.The Otterbox is pricier than most other phone cases ranging from fifty to sixty dollars, but the money is worth the quality of the cases. They last for a long time and as I've mentioned before, they seriously protect the phone from most damage you could do. I'm very clumsy with my belongings and just having the Otterbox on my phone has made a huge difference. I never once had a scratch or crack on my iPhone 4 and have yet to scratch or crack my iPhone 5. I can't even imagine the damage I would have on my phone if I didn't have the Otterbox. Overall, the Otterbox Defender series for the iPhone 5 is a great case if you're looking for the best value and protection for your phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review98" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-10:</strong> Despite OtterBox having a warranty on this case and having gone through with the RMA, I can say that both rubber shells have stretched way beyond normal conditions.

Terrible customer service.First off, the clip is very frustrating to fit the phone into, and the first time i used it, i put it on wrong, putting a tear in the case. i am not a clutz either. I have had other phone clips.Second, and the worst part of the case... i paid extra compared to the other, cheaper otterbox, for the built-in screen protector. That is why i bought the case compared to others, and probably why others buy it as well. Well.. for me, and I have spoken to others, it puts a HUGE  watermark that is irremovable! I spent HOURS trying tot get rid of it. it was not dust or fingerprints. i do not know what the issue was. but it was terrible to look at. I emailed them, and they forwarded me to a video, made by some random youtube user, that suggested I put baby powder in between the case and the phone! i did this, and i just had a crappy case, with baby powder in it! Why would they sell such a product, knowing most people would need to buy baby powder to make the watermark go away. The watermark did go away, but the case was filled with baby powder!  Who would buy an expensive case, just to put baby powder in it! Also, their second suggestion was to rip out the screen protector, and buy an adhesive one! If the feature is advertised to work, and it does not, then that feature (the built in screen protector) should not be sold in the case yet. I emailed them back, saying the baby powder did not work. they did not respond to me.terrible customer service, terrible case.I will never buy another product from this company.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review106" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-17:</strong> I love the Defender series cases. With my old 3Gs phones, the outer rubber skin would begin to tear after a while, but it's easy to replace. The protection provided is unbeatable! You can practically drop your phone from an airplane with these things and it will survive! Just to prove my point, I would throw my phone all the time as a demonstration. The old phones still work perfect, and there's not a scratch on them anywhere. I have little doubt these will prove just as reliable. Thank you Otterbox!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review107" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-15:</strong> I bought this case from Amazon and most of all great Price,I never had any Issues with Otterbox Defender cases it really Protects your phone,I will buy more and more any day.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review108" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-04:</strong> I had resisted buying the Defender on last last three phones but after breaking my second Otterbox Commuter on my iPhone 5, I decided it was time for the added protection.

I have used many OtterBox cases in the past, so I felt I could trust it. The installation was easy. It was nice to have the screen protector integrated into the case, so I didn't have to worry about lining up the usual screen protectors and getting a bubble on my screen or a spec of dust. I haven't really dropped it and it definitely is not waterproof. It does tend to collect fine dust and every few months I pop it out to clean the phone. There is no decrease in sound quality or reception of cell phone signal. I have noted that the rubber has started to slowly degrade over the last year since I purchased this case but it has kept the iPhone inside safe and sound. It definitely adds some weight to the phone, which I guess can be expected to keep it safe from any unforeseen accident waiting to happen. Overall no big complaints but I feel that in the next few months may have to start hunting for a replacement.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review115" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-03:</strong> I got this for my iphone 5 and raelly love it.I have dropped my phone twice and it still works fine.The screen protector doesn't interfere with the function of the phone and the dual case really protects the phone.The flaps easily open up to connect something or turn the volume off/on.I would recommend that you use the carrying case and not your pockets as this begins to break down the outer case.It's all the constant pulling and putting back in to the pockets that does it,so don't do it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review116" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-16:</strong> I was surprised, I thought it would be really big and bulky.

I was extremely disappointed with this case, the hard plastic of the commuter case began to crack and break off in pieces after only a month of use (see pictures and review on Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/OtterBox-Commuter-Series-iPhone-Frustration-Free/dp/B00974L0F4/ref=cm_cmu_pg__header). Our kids tend to be a quite hard on our phones, especially the toddler! But all the previous cases from otterbox have held up so well, I have an old iPhone 4S commuter case that is over 2 years old and still in great shape. So I decided to upgrade to the Defender case to see if it would perform properly. I also waited almost 6 months to write this review. The Defender case has held up as expected, and is still working great. After multiple drops, and harsh treatment the case still looks like new, and no damage to phone or screen. Highly recommend spending the extra money for the defender case over the commuter if you are in need of an iPhone 5 case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review119" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-09-30:</strong> I have been using the Otterbox Defender for all of my Apple devices (including iPad) since the iPhone 3G.  The Otterbox Defender for iPhone 5 is, in my opinion, the best yet.  Every iteration brings slightly better engineering and understanding of the product design and the materials needed, and cutouts for port accessibility.There is a distinguishable difference between the Defender for iPhone 4/4S and that of the 5 and this can be easily seen in some design changes:1) The outer silicone is slightly stiffer but seems more durable than other iterations.  It slides on the plastic grooves and port openings easily like a glove and the port openings and closing flaps stay put and snug the device well.  Kudos.2) The plastic inner cover is much easier to snap on and off - it uses 6 snaps with well-marked arrows.  It takes a lot less struggle to get the phone in and out of the case for cleaning or what not.3) The screen cover fits perfectly.  With all Otterbox products you DO sacrifice some display quality (in this case Retina) for the option of protection.  If you need Otterbox Defender protection, this is just one of the cost / benefits.  I experience the same issue with my iPad Defender and realize this is just a byproduct of the screen protection.  There are no screen bubbles to report ... perfect fit as with the iPhone 4 Defender.  There are also openings in the front to allow for the Facetime and regular camera to be exposed without the covers that were on the front of the prior versions of Defender.  There may be mixed reviews on this one (pros and cons of dust build-up) but I like it and will just ensure I clean my phone more.  The dust build-up in the smaller crevices on prior versions of the Defender were not that welcome and were difficult to clean.4) The updated holster design is welcomed!  It is much less bulky but somehow adds more durability to the clip.  The turning mechanism on the clip is much smoother and seems more durable.  I knew several colleagues who dealt with broken clips and I think that this will be less a problem with the iPhone 5 Otterbox Defender holster clip.  The design of the holster is also more open on the sides and this makes handling a bit easier while providing less bulk.One of the main things that I was concerned about with was the smoother outer silicone cover was the slippery-factor and the fingerprint-factor.  Surprisingly, I have not dropped the phone once and fingerprints or smudges are a lot less impervious than I expected.I will certainly continue to put the Otterbox Defender for iPhone 5 through it's paces as I usually do.  I think the material and design changes make for a great product.Nice product!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review120" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-09-25:</strong> I got my first Otterbox Defender case for the iPhone 4 when I first got it, and at first I didn't like it, but then I developed a phobia of having the phone out of it. Then I got a 4S and had an Otterbox Defender on it. I was used to it, and it kept the iPhone mint until time to sell it.Fast forward to this week, when I got this one for my new iPhone 5, and I must say they have made a much better quality case than before. It's a much snugger fit than before, and is actually a bit difficult to open the case. This does mean slightly better protection... or at least it would, were there not such a huge opening for the camera/flash combo, as well as the iSight camera and speaker. This seems to be a big deal for many, but not so much for me. I always had an issue cleaning dust and lint out of those openings on my old case, and now that's a thing of the past. My first Otterbox also seemed to make the feature where the screen deactivates when held up to your ear not work, no problems at all with this one, and no noticeable drop in signal quality either.The texture of this case does not feel as "rubberized" as the silicon case on the previous model. At first I wasn't sure I liked this, due to the non-slip factor of it, but I've come to enjoy it. The flaps the cover the charging port and microphone feel much sturdier than before, and I don't have to worry about them coming open accidentally.As always, a great case, from a great company. A bit overpriced, but hey, Applecare protection costs you what this case does, and if you have to use it, another $50 on top of that. Buy one of these, and just don't worry about it. These are the only phone cases I trust... and they have saved my iPhone from many potential shatters.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review121" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-18:</strong> I don't like this at all.

I really wanted a case with a built in battery.  But the iphone 5 was just too new and no one had a case that really protected the phone.  Really like the water resistant design and the cover over the screen, something that is lacking on most cases.  The market finally developed a pretty good iphone case with a battery but it does not have the protection this case provides.  Other Otter cases are pretty extreme, practically needing a crowbar to remove the case, and doubling the size of the phone.  This case is a nice happy medium</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review124" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-05:</strong> Great for what it was intended, protection.

Here are some Pros and Some suggestions for improvement.Pros:-Provides extreme protection from being tossed, hitting the concrete, being sat on, and other stress caused by everyday wear and tear.-Very solid build-Feels good in the hand.-Rubberized exterior provides a good hold, and prevents those accidental slips. Also it stays put in your car's dashboard.Room for improvement.-Does not allow other chargers other than the slim original to fit.-Some headphone jacks that are not slim have trouble fitting in.-If you use the clip it is likely that the rubber outer layer will get worn out faster.-Outer rubber layer after around a year is very &#34;saggy&#34; and no longer fits the hard shell very well.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review137" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-09-24:</strong> iPhone 5 defender case does not fit the iPhone 5!

I remember the original Defender product for the 3 (Yes, I am that old!). It was bulky, heavy, and somewhat of a nuisance but it protected and it was made for teens and adults alike! Not only does Otterbox make a quality, tried, and tested product, they are a fun company, and stand behind their products. After a couple of drops here and there, the cases may crack but your phone will be fully functional! Otterbox will replace the item under their limited lifetime warranty without hesitation!Back to the Defender...The Defender for iPhone 5 is different, for starters the silicone wrap feels thicker. Secondly, the case is less bulky yet offers the same level of protection. It is not going to be super thin and may not look shexy but it will protect your phone! It was easy to configure and the built-in screen protector did not have air bubbles or watermarks like the original Defender cases. Finally, it comes with a belt holster which adds I believe another dimension of protection if used. You can opt not to use the belt holster for less bulk. Without getting into too much detail, the ports are protected from dust/damage by tabs on the silicone wrap. This is a plus, esp because I have been the dock connector on phones get damaged far too easily. It is a solid feeling case and the color choices are splendid! When you have a phone like the 5, you want piece (peace) of mind that your phone will remain fully functional after traumatic impact. Someday phones will have airbags or perhaps they will be thin as air?...in any case!!Cases are based on personal preference.

I had the Defender for my 3GS and it protected my phone all these years. Didn't have the iPhone 4/4S so I can't compare it to that. Quick impressions so far:PROTECTION - Protection wise, the iPhone 5 Defender is at par with the 3GS.  Industrial grade protection with complete coverage. Same concept and overall design, though the silicone feels slightly thicker and more solid in the 5. The silicone has a matte finish compared to the smooth finish in the 3GS, which hopefully should help avoid dust and lint - this was the only drawback with the 3GS case, it needed cleaning frequently.BUTTONS/PORTS - Power and volume buttons are covered with silicone shaped like the buttons themselves. No problem pressing either of these buttons with the silicone. The headphone jack, charging port, and silent button have silicone plugs that can be pulled out to expose the jacks. (TIP - to open the plugs, insert nail and push the top silicone part higher to get behind the plug to pull it out. Hope this makes sense. The headphone plug is tiny and it can take some time getting used to opening it). The charging port plug, when opened, keeps snapping back into the case, which means it has to be held open with one hand to insert the charger. Insignificant issue, and I'm hoping that with use, this piece will loosen up a bit so that it stays open if needed. Opening at the back for the Apple logo is covered with a transparent plastic film. The front camera/speaker, the back camera/flash, and the two speakers at the bottom are left open and are the only exposed parts of the phone.SCREEN COVERAGE - Clear plastic film on the screen integrated into the case, the touchscreen experience is as good with the film as it is without the case. The transparent film creates a tiny layer of air or moisture between itself and the screen, which can create watermarks on the screen. This was an issue with the 3GS as well. (TIP - I had read several forums for my 3GS that recommended applying baby powder before installing this case, but I personally didn't find that to be a lasting solution. Applying an Anti-Glare film to the phone's screen before installing the case was the best solution. I am still waiting for my Anti-Glare film to come in, but I installed a spare I had for my 3GS just to see if that solved the issue with the 5, and it did).HOLSTER - The silicone is kept intact with two plastic tabs on the side. This really helps keep the silicone in shape and prevents it from stretching or loosening over time. These tabs also work as the locking mechanism for the holster. The case can be inserted facing in or out in the holster, a fine improvement by Otterbox. Most such holsters I have seen only allow face-in orientation (3GS allowed only face-in which I found annoying when going for a run). This holster has a fully rotating belt clip so that it can be attached vertically or horizontally on the belt. No chance of the case falling out, nice secure fit. The holster is much better and ergonomically designed than the 3GS version. It is easier to access the phone with this design.Here are a few details that I would have liked to see improved/addressed:- Front and back camera openings - the two openings are huge! The front camera/speaker/light sensor opening is one big opening. For the 3GS version (3GS only has speaker on the front, no camera) and from what I have seen for the 4S, the cases had a precision opening which provided better overall coverage. For the back, the opening is approximately 30-40% bigger than it should be for the camera and flash. It would have been nice to have more precise openings on both places for even better protection.- Headphone jack plug - this perhaps has more to do with the placement of the headphone jack itself, but the case opening is really small and it's not very smooth to open the silicone plug. For the 3GS, the silicone plug went around the headphone jack to the back, which made opening it a breeze. They could have used the same design for the 5 as well. With the current design, it takes time opening the headphone plug. It's entirely possible it is just something that takes getting used to, or that the silicone will loosen over time making it easier to open.- The iPhone 5 is a super sleek, light, and slick looking device. Putting the Defender case makes it bulky (more than doubles the thickness). Now this is a pro in that it offers super-protection which I cannot live without. The downside is that it takes away the aesthetic beauty of the iPhone.I bought this in black when that was the only color available. Now it seems there are a lot more choices. Wish I had waited for the Glacier (just a personal preference)!Other than these minor issues, I am overall very happy with this case and I hope to use it for several years to come, just I did with my 3GS Defender. Yes, it's slightly expensive, but it's also peace of mind.UPDATE 10-12-12The watermark issue seems to be persistent with this case and nothing seems to permanently help in this regard. The anti-glare film bridges the gap somewhat but only for a few days. The screen in the case lifts right back up after a few days and creates the watermark issue all over again making it difficult to use the screen. I am sending this back to get a different case. Yes, I want to protect my iPhone which is why I was willing to put up with the bulk of this case, but I can't give up functionality.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review145" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-29:</strong> I used an OtterBox Defender for my iPhone 3GS and was very happy with it.  I have an outdoor job and in the past I have dropped and even mowed over phones, so I needed something damn near bullet proof.  I cannot tell you how many times I had dropped my 3GS and never had a problem with my phone following.  So I after extensively searching cases for my iPhone 5, I ended up buying an OtterBox Defender for it.OtterBox Defender Series Case for iPhone 5 - Retail Packaging - PunkAs in the past, it is a great case, providing excellent protection.  The only caveat, the screen protector has a little to much of a gap between it and the screen, so it can take a few times to make a selection on the phone, it annoying, but not enough to buy a different case, something for OtterBox to work on.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review146" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-14:</strong> As everyone knows Otterbox cases are some of the best out there. If you want to protect your phone and turn it from slim to bulky, this is the way to go. 4 stars because the rubber material is softer than any other otterbox case I have encountered. This one seems to be a different rubber recipe. It's much softer and pliable then other cases.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review147" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-30:</strong> Otterbox is well known for a reason, they make tough quality cases. I was a little concerned that there is no cover over the earpiece or camera, however they are recessed enough that I've had no trouble at all with scratching or smudging even. The clip is tough and definitely useful as a point of attachment, but also as a stand for watching videos. The rubber outer case has definitely improved since the cases for the 3Gs's. The outer shell feels much sturdier and I have a feeling it will outlast the old style rubber. Installation and removal has improved drastically as well. I'm not annoyed when I want to take my phone out of this case as I was with older models. Overall, a great product I'd recommend to anyone looking for something to make their phone outlast everybody with clip on cases.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review148" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-28:</strong> UPDATE: The holster clip broke after 5 months.  The case itself is still good so I guess I'll order a replacement holster.ORIGINAL: This case is very sturdy.  I like the built-in screen protector and the rubberized back and sides.  The ports for earphones and charging are easy to access and the buttons all work just fine.  The screen protector sits flush with the screen and allows full use of the screen.  I have not noticed any calibration issues when typing or swiping.  The ports are protected as well, though I would not call this "water proof" by any means.  It does give peace of mind when out in the rain.  There's even a cover for the mute switch.  The volume and power buttons are fully covered as well.  The cameras (front and back) and light both work just fine without any obstructions.  I also like the rubberized case as it is easy to hold and the phone doesn't slide around much when laying on a flat surface, like the leather seat in my car.The only downsides are the case is difficult to unclip from the holster one-handed.  Oh, and the self-standing feature for the holster (when doing Facetime) is useless as it hardly tilts back at all.  It's a nice idea but I end up using a book to tilt my phone for FaceTime calls.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review149" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-16:</strong> I really like this case and it protects my phone very nicely.

Wow, my svelte iPhone 5 is turned into a chunky tank that is at least twice as thick!  This case offers great protection with the clam box and then a hefty rubber outer armor.  The material is of high quality and looks durable enough to last for quite some time.PROS - 1)The hefty box offers great protection, far better than the typical silicone cases. 2)Most buttons are sealed to prevent dust or dirt. 3)The built-in screen-protector is a great feature.  I heard of others complaining about the watermark issue with the built-in protector so I added another screen-protector on the screen before putting the iPhone5 under the built-in screen-protector.  This seemed to have done the trick.  I don't have any watermark at all with the dual screen-protectors.  4) The product is made of high quality and durable materials.CONS - 1)A PAIN TO OPEN THE CLAM BOX!  I had such a hard time opening the clam box to insert my iPhone.  It was easy to open one side of the clam box but it was a struggle to pry open the other side.  The side-hinge kept closing by itself. It took me 15 minutes to ease it open by inserting my finger nail into the gaps to slowly pry it open.  It finally worked but it was so frustrating!  I hope that I won't need to open the clam box too often.  2) It is ironic that Otterbox puts a clear film on the apple logo while no such film is available for either the front or rear facing cameras.  What would you care more, a scratched apple logo or a scratched camera lens?  I don't understand why there is such a flaw in the design!  3) There is a very minute gap between the built-in screen protector and the actual screen.  As such, you need to put a bit more force on the built-in screen-protector to obtain the same results.I will keep this Otterbox as it offers the best protection for my iPhone.  This would be an amazing case if the clam box were easier to open and the two camera openings were actually sealed.One last thought...  With so many Otterbox counterfeits, I bought mine from Amazon as the seller (it's probably a few bucks more) and I definitely got a genuine case.  I wonder how many negative reviews were due to counterfeits from other sellers.  My clam box was a perfect fix, there is no fit issue as mentioned in some reviews.  I wonder whether the issue was caused by counterfeits?</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review158" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-25:</strong> Very good quality and fit for the phone.

It covers nearly every aspect of the iPhone with a thick layer of plastic and rubber. I bought this case for my iPhone 5s because I didn't find myself using the touch ID all too often. I picked this case up during a sale for $14.99 on Amazon.The biggest flaw in this case is the included screen protector. It's essentially a thick piece of plastic glued to the inside of the case. When the phone is inside the case, the screen protector does not lay completely adhered to the screen. Because of this, the screen requires extra pressure for a touch to register. It's incredibly annoying and quite audible if you're trying to text quickly. I ended up pulling the screen protector off which solves that problem but creates a new one. If you pull the protector out, you get a small gap that goes all around the screen making it really easy to trap dirt which only causes more damage.Another problem is the thickness combined with the grippy rubber material. The phone looks large in the pocket and the material makes it difficult to remove from the pocket. I know this is nitpicking but unless you have a job that absolutely requires such a case, I can't really recommend this product. I ended up using a different case on my phone and saved this case for physical outdoor activities such as hiking or biking.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review167" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-05:</strong> I think it offers great protection.

(I just got tired of the first color, and the case and screen protector were scuffed up).  I love that it has a built-in screen protector and is made of a well-cushioned (I suppose silicone) material that protects the phone.  I've dropped it a few time with no damage.  I hate trying to apply individual stick-on screen protectors.  I never seem to be able to get all of the bubbles out.  The material is non-skid, so it won't easily slip off your dashboard or chair arm.  When I'm holding it, I feel like I have a good, comfortable grip.  Yes, it does add noticeable weight to the phone, but that doesn't bother me.While it's not water-PROOF, it does give you quite a bit of protection against rain or spills. Occasionally, you may get a bit of dust between the phone screen and the protector, but it's easy to remove it, wipe it off and put it back together.  When doing this, you should take care not to pull on the rubberized protector so much that you stretch it out of shape.  I learned that with the first case.  It was still OK, but didn't fit quite so tight after that.I plan to stick with the OtterBox.

The rubber part of the old Otterbox got very floppy and loose, which I couldn't stand, and I hated the clip.  When I got the iPhone 5, I was going to wait for the Griffin to come out, but I really needed high protection so I bought the Otterbox.  I love it.  Yes, it is bulky - but I want maximum protection, so I really don't care about that.  It fits great, and the outer rubber part is much more firm and doesn't look like it will become loose over time.  The clip is a big improvement too - you can have the phone facing in our out, which is great.  And the case stays securely in the clip, so I never fear that it will fall out.  The only thing I don't like is the kickstand feature of the clip.  Because the top and bottom is unbalanced, you can only kickstand it in portrait view, and when you do use it - it puts the phone at a 90 degree angle so you can't really put it on the table next to you it's very awkward.  That is why I gave it 4 stars, because that is a feature I used constantly with my Griffin.  If I could give it 4.5 stars I would, because otherwise I love it!!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review184" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-18:</strong> My wife is happy, she has a stylish cover for her phone and this thing PROTECTS the phone.

I purchase this for my dad who complained that the iPhone was too small. He then complained that this case was too large. There's just no way to make the man happy. But the fact that his phone is in near pristine condition probably does. From what I've been told and my experience, the built-in plastic screen protector makes the touch-screen less convenient. The case also comes with its own holster, which makes this case even larger than it already is.Personally, I would not purchase this for myself because it's waay too large for me.

That being said, I ordered this particular case by accident.  I was looking for a &#34;defender&#34; for my iPhone 5S to replace the somewhat extra-bulky Taktik, got &#34;dizzy&#34; from the multitude of choices, and ultimately ended up buying the wrong case.  This case is as marked - for the iPhone 5, not the 5S with the Touch-ID fingerprint sensor.  It was entirely my own mistake, and online return was quick, easy, and painless.  Way to go, Amazon!I have since discovered the Tech21 Impact cases with D3O material.  Go YouTube some video drop-tests or look up the D3O material demonstrations.  The Tech21 Impact provides very nearly the same level of protection from bumps and drops as the Otterbox, but at a fraction of the size and less cost.  But, there is no integrated screen protector with the Tech21, so if that's important to you, stick with the Otterbox.  On the other hand, there are some really nice screen protectors out there - the oleophobic glass ones are particularly nice and very affordable.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review202" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-06:</strong> The case is very sturdy, but not waterproof.  The clip on the holster malfunctioned and locked in the open position while I  was sitting in a chair.  Not sure how that happened, but the phone dropped to the carpeted floor.  I chose to return the case with holster.After returning this Defender, I purchased the Otterbox Armor waterproof case, which I also returned because the sound was muffled.  I then looked at several other cases, and finally decided to order another Defender.  This time, I am not using the holster that comes with the case.  Instead, I am trying the  Klein Tools 5715 PowerLine Black Nylon Mobile Phone Holder, Large.  It is a bit too large for the defender case, but in the first few days, the clip has held up well.  If that changes, I will update this review.  I have left the stars at 3 as I think the holster should have worked better.7/21/2013  The Klein Tools 5715 PowerLine Black Nylon Mobile Phone Holder, Large came off my belt when it got tangled up with my seatbelt.

It's slimmer than the Defender for the iPhone 4. Obviously taller. The hard plastic shell has six points of click clousure rather then the three before. The rubber silicone skin seems tougher and firmer. The packaging is modern plastic rather than cardboard recyclable. Just on first handling it's much nicer than the previous gen, not diminishing the 4 series. I've dropped my iPhone and not a scratch or damage. It just protects it like nobodies business.I'll add more when I get my iPhone 5 and can fully test. This is so far, very impressive.Edit: I uploaded some pictures and also did a YouTube video unboxing, search "iPhone 5 Otterbox Defender"Amazon removed my link.Edit: I added more photos. 9/18/12Edit: 9/22/12My iPhone 5 arrived yesterday. I assembled the Defender around it. It fits like a glove. The screen is crystal clear and touch is as responsive as on the glass itself. The underlying image is beautiful and clear, no distortion to my eyes. Based on the crazy lightness of the iPhone 5 the Defended 5 is fairly light to hold. I heard the 5 was lighter but when I compared it to my 4, WOW.Grip is good, I feel some "sharpness" on some grips that I never noticed on the 4. Nothing bad, just different. Two things I do notice are the bottom flaps. I have a headphone set with a medium large jack. It barely fits, it actually forces the Defender apart just a bit when I click it in. I'm also concerned that Apple's Lightning to Old Dock Connector adapter will either not fit or be VERY tight. I don't have one so I'll let the first reviewer who buys one comment. Just concerned.I also notice when wearing it on my belt it is easier to get to my pocket than the 4 was. It is trimmer by a good bit. This is really good for me as it was alway a fight to get my keys out with the Defender over my pocket.Overall I'm very happy and will report if things change. I'm sticking with five stars.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review209" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-05:</strong> protects against everything pretty much! it looks awesome too! if you are worried about it being too bulky, don't be. it's really not that bad. easy to hold, easy to use. great product! and cheaper than in stores</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review210" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-18:</strong> Just recieved my otterbox today and was pleasently suprised that it fits like a glove. i have had oter otterboxes for the iphone 5 and always ended up returning them because of the issue that the hardshell case was too big for the iphone 5 and caused the phone to slide up and down in the case. not the issue with this one. it fits like a glove with no wiggle room whatsoever. i dont know if otterbox came out with a second updated shell due to all the complaints of this issue or if its a nock-off. the box is genuine and displays the halogram logo on the top so im guessing its the real deal. whatever the case i like it. the silicone is very tight on the perimeter of the shell and doesnt look cheaply made. it will last a long time it seems. time will tell. the only issue i have is that the home button is a bit stiff and needs to be pressed harder to navigate but thats all i have to complain about. all the ports are covered (lightening/headjack) the speakers are exposed but thats ok. sound quality is great with no interference. overall a great case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review211" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-20:</strong> My wife protected her iPhone 4 for 2 years in an Otterbox Defender so her iPhone 5 will receive the same protection.

Rock solid protection, 99% water proof / resistant.  (My daughter had her phone in the Defender case, and it fell into the ocean and was submerged for 10 minutes, while we searched for it.  Found the phone and it worked like a charm.)Some people have complained that the fit of the hard shell is not that good, but I found the opposite.  The fit is excellent, and the silicone case fits perfectly around the shell.  The new silicone looks like it will hold its shape longer, but only time will tell.  My concern is with the holster, which seems snugger.  They have redesigned the holster, and you have to get the phone into two lower tabs, push the phone into the tabs before locking it into place with the top latch, or else the latch pinches on the silicone liner just by the center groove, and I can see this being the point where the silicone gets cut down the road.....(hence the minus 1 star).  Other than that, this is probably the best protection for the money, other than getting the Seidio Obex which is way more money....</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review213" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-03:</strong> This is a great case that my wife and I have been using for several years now.

There is space that allows the phone to slide in the case.  I was worried about dust and grit getting into this space and damaging my phone.  Also, I read in some of the reviews that the phone had left permanent imprints in their phone screens.  Therefore, when I tried it on, I left the screen protector on.  After a few hours on my phone, I removed it and noticed that there was, indeed, an imprint on the screen protector around the opening for the speaker/camera and where the case encircles the home button.  Because the screen protector was on, there was no damage to the screen.  Needless to say, I returned it.  Because the Otterbox Defender provides superior protection, I gave it three stars.  Once Otterbox corrects these defects, I plan to purchase another.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review227" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-19:</strong> The outterbox was purchased for my son and it is protecting his phone when he drops it and from any scratching and keeping the phone looking brand new</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review228" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-30:</strong> It was so durable I could not figure out how to open it.

They only require a photo of the broken part, which means you can use your old case in the interm It takes about 2 weeks to receive your replacement part.

In comparison to the OtterBox Defender series case for the iPhone 4S. The Defender for the iPhone 5 is by far the worst OtterBox case yet. The rubber material jacket that makes up the entire case is different from the previous models. The rubber coating is sticky not soft, and attracts lint and dust on to the case, defeating the entire purpose for this type of case. The faceplate cutout for the earpice of the phone is not secure and traps dust and particles underneath, possibly scratching the phone's front. The included belt clip holster is too small for the case to fit in it, you'll need to bend it a bit to get the phone into it's place. Even then it feels flimsy and cheap. Overall if you're looking for a case that will protect your iPhone, you might want to save your money and look elsewhere. This case (especially the "Punk" model) is very disappointing to say the least...</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review248" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-11:</strong> Great case, i really liked the color scheme. got shipped earlier than expected. chillin! and im not just saying that!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review249" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-11:</strong> Fits my phone perfectly.

I noticed two differences, although I'm sure there are many more that I just don't notice because they don't affect me.Plastic over rear-facing camera:  The old case had protective clear plastic covering the rear-facing (towards me) camera area, it was a small window, collected dirt, and was difficult to clean.  I used the rear-facing camera a lot because I used the phone to Skype quite frequently.  After a year or so that plastic got cloudy from so much dirt and cleaning, so I'd remove the case when I Skyped, then of course wouldn't get it put back on, etc.  The new case doesn't have plastic covering the rear-facing camera area, and the window is much larger, and therefore easier to clean.  I like it a lot better.Silicone outer cover is different:  The old case had a softer, more pliable, and &#34;gummier&#34; silicone case.  The camera wouldn't slide into my purse or pocket as easily, and collected dirt.  But the little flaps were very easy to open and close.  The new case has a harder outside layer, it is not at all sticky.  But the flaps (for the cable and for the volume off switch) are stiff and not as easy to open and close.  My son had one with similar plastic, and the flap covering the cable port cracked and broke off after a while.My last case held up really well for the two years I used it, but the clear plastic covering the face of it did get some scuffs and scratches.  I have a friend who uses the plastic screen protector film ON TOP OF the clear plastic of the Otter Box, and he said it works great.  I'm going to do that with this new one.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review256" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-03:</strong> Love Otter Boxes.

It makes it feel a little less responsive and not as comfortable under your fingers. Good luck using a dock of any kind with this bad boy because the case makes the IPhone 5 much bigger  though it does not add to much weight.

It's easy to get dupe in to thinking you bought an official product but the only thing official is the package and not the product.

It is durable and many times, this case has protected the Iphones we have from a fall or drop. So far, these Iphone 5's have survived 5ft drops and bounces off counters. They show no signs of damage because of how the case is built. The case may seem larger than most, but this phone has the best shot of surviving a drop on the street where there are jagged raised points on the surface because the phone is set back in the case. The runner is very durable. It absorbs a lot of shock and should last you a long time. I purchased 2 of these cases for $45 on Amazon, way cheaper than the $50 for one case Bestbuy offers. We don't really use the holdsters, but the case itself is overall better. The defender series comes with a built in screen protector so you never have to buy an annoying one where you need to push the bubbles out. This one you put on and your done. Easiest screen protector ever. And I find the responsiveness of the phone is better with this screen protector on it.My only con with the Iphone 5 Otterbox Defender case is that the charging port is difficult to open. You really need nails to bend back the flap that protects the port. I feel this could have been designed better, but the case overall protects it so well that its not worth returning. Overall, the best case I have found on the market at this price point for protection.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review291" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-27:</strong> FIRST- I LOVE IT.

Amazon really took care of me.  I received a credit on the Lifeproof purchase quickly.  You really can purchase from Amazon with confidence.  Now, the Otter box worked out well.  The Otter box for the iPhone 5 is slimmer and more durable, way more durable than the Lifeproof.  the Lifeproof advertises, it can be submerged.  Not so fast, I almost lost the phone.  The POC leaked.  It seems the cheesy made door that seals the charging port is the weak link.  Go Otter....No claims that may cause you to lose your phone.  Contacting the Seller, no answer, had to get Amazon involved.  Best advise....avoid the way over priced  &#34;Lifeproof&#34; and their claims and stay with tried and true.  Go Otter Box.

Since I spent quite a bit on my phone I thought it best to protect it a little bit better.  I purchased two of these cases, the blue for my husband and the blush for myself, and so far we are both very pleased with them.Pros:*Great protection against drops.*Easy access to buttons.  Easy to push buttons.*Makes phone easier to hold on to.*Comes with built-in screen protector, no more annoying stick-ons!*Reasonably priced.Cons:*The blush is very bright pink.  It looked lighter in the picture online, and the hard plastic part looked white online.  It's actually gray.  The blue case was pretty true to color.*Our audio cables for the car did not work with the OtterBox.  They were too thick to fit the inner case.  We ended up purchasing two of theseMediabridge 3.5mm Male To 3.5mm Male Stereo Audio Cable - 8 Feet - Step Down Design accommodates iPhone, iTouch, SmartPhone and MP3 casescables to accommodate.  Now we can use with our MP3 input jacks in the car.*These cases do make the phone bulky.*The rubber part does attract a bit of purse and pocket lint, but it's not terrible and it comes off easily.After using these for a day we have decided they are keepers.Update 4-18-13The case fit loose from the start (the outside rubber part) which I did not notice at first.  My husband's case is nice and tight.  This got so annoying after awhile that I took the case off and got a different brand.  Also, the screen protector over time proved to be horrible, both with attracting smudges and scratches, and it is so large that it's hard to fit it in my pocket.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review294" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-13:</strong> My product arrived with packaging that was unsealed and looked used. I guess that's how they get the price to $17.77! The case didn't make it onto my iPhone 5. The outer part of the case is rigid plastic, not the softer, silicone-like flexible material used on the model for my 4S. So the case feels much heavier than my old one.

There is another one by Incipio that has a similar protection level, but is much sleeker (look for the dual pro I think)...half the price, too. My dad got this one, I got the Incipio.

Having had an Otterbox for my 4 as well, I knew pretty much what I was getting into.Pros:- It was available when I got the phone.- I like the color selections (I have the Hunter Green, and it is Olive/ Hunter Green)- New rubber material is harder, sturdier feeling and it feels thinner than previous plastic, less squishy- Much less "grippy" for going in your pocket.- Combined with the phone's slimmer size, this case actually will fit in your pocket and come out easily- All the major stuff is covered save the speakers- Buttons are all accessible and headphone jack (with iPhone buds at least) accessible.- Feels toughCons:- Less grippy, do not leave on dashboard.- This new material has me worried.  Where the old cases eventually just disintegrated, I feel like the tab for the sync cable will break off long before the case  is out of commission.  It's already showing stress lines after a week.- Screen pop - this should only last a few days, screen will eventually get more flexible and lay down.- Grease spot screen - this also happened the first 5 days or so, but has now fixed it's self, just give it time- The hard black inner case is a nightmare to take off.  Do it over a couch or a pillow or something, your phone could pop out.  I have pretty nimble fingers and it was really hard to get it out, much worse than the old one.- The rigidity of the rubber makes peeling the hard case out pretty difficult too, you'll feel like you're breaking it, but you aren't.  Same with putting it back on, you have to be forceful with it.- As always, you lose all the design ascetics of the phone. But you also don't ding it all up in a month.Once the other companies catch up, I'll shelve the Otter unless I'm going on a trip or hiking or something.  Day to-day, for me, it's a bit much and I'm pretty careful with my phones so I'm not crazy worried.Also, I would get some sort of plastic screen protector for your phone first.  That way should anything get between the Otterbox screen and the phone, it won't be etching fine lines.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review303" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-13:</strong> Well made, nice color and camo pattern and i have very little worries about my phone being damaged from the occasional drop by my 15 month old little girl!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review304" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-21:</strong> If you are looking for a heavy duty case that protects your phone, let me reassure you that this would be the perfect case. however, there is one major draw back that keeps this case from being number one, and that would have to be its size.

A little bulky, but it was good and worked good on the phone. I eventually got a LifeProof case and really did like that one. When I bought the iPhone 5, the only rugged case Apple had was this case, so I bought it. First impressions...  it sure is big and kinda bulky. But does the job for protection. What I don't like about this case is that when you want to move your apps around, say to another page.. it's next to impossible with my finger to get the app to the next page, especially when going to the left. I actually had to move the case around a little bit to get a better angle on it so that the swipe would work. With the case off, I have no problem with this at all. I'm also not too big on how they designed the bottom of it and the angle of it. It just seems to sit too high right where the apps are when you put your finger there. Other than these, it seems pretty decent, but i'll still be getting the lipeproof case when it comes out for the iPhone 5. Hopefully they'll keep the same design as the 4/4S and just make it to form fit like the prior one..UPDATE 10/19/12:  I couldn't take it anymore. I was ready to rip this darn thing off my phone. I felt like I was carrying around a brick compared to what I was used to on the 4S, I hated how bulky it was, how haevy it felt with a thinner, lighter phone in it, and a pain to try to text and move apps around. So... I bought a Splash case with the screen protector and really like that one. Here is what I went with: http://www.amazon.com/Splash-Cruiser-Polycarbonate-Slider-iPhone/dp/B005SE9IIS/ref=cm_cr-mr-titleHopefully now that the iPhone 5 is out, Otterbox will do some fine tuning on their design and make it more user friendly. I was really disappointed on this one. Hopefully Otterbox reads these reviews and gets some ideas from the consumers thoughts on this. I dropped the Otterbox rating from 3 stars down to 2. It still does a darn good job of protecting the phone, it's just too bulky for me, and a pain to really use the phone to its utmost potential</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review324" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-03:</strong> Good quality it is worth the price. this fit very good and appear to be very protective i would purchase more of these. nice color also.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review325" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-22:</strong> I am a big believer in protecting whatever phone I have, because I always resell when I upgrade, these OTTERBOXES take FANTASTIC care of your phone.

I really like the changes that Otterbox has made in the way the rubber engages the plastic inner liner with little to no gaps out of box. After a month of use I can say that the performance has been better than Defender cases I had on 4/4S cases. The port covers can be a challenge to open but you will quickly develop a method that works for you. The silence button is difficult to operate but that is a tradeoff with the port cover staying in place at all times. Two things I would change if given the chance are I would like to see a larger opening for the camera that would accommodate after-market lenses. The other change would be to either make the dock port larger to fit Apple 30-Pin adapter or offer a dock adapter from Otterbox that interfaces their case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review329" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-11:</strong> I used a Defender for my iphone 4 and it was terrific. The Defender for my Iphone 5 has been problematic. The fit between the silicone case and the holster was extremely tight, and the phone had to be forced into the holster. After grooves were eroded into the silicone case by the retainer clip, mounting and dismounting became a little easier. Unfortunately the retainer clip breaks after one to three months of use; I believe I have used four or five new retainer clips in the 14 months I have used this case. Each broke at the same part of the clip  The case, even when new, did not fit the phone well and frequent removal and cleaning was required. Eventually the silicone portion of the case stretched out and now bulges 3 to 4 millimeters away from the phone contours at the corners, giving the appearance of sagging breasts at the corners, and is loose in general on the phone. The flap over the ear phone socket has torn off. I have given up on the belt clip and carry the phone in my pocket (quite bulky) because I am clumsy and the case still provides excellent impact protection.Otterbox has tried to be helpful, sent me the new holsters free. They are aware of the problems with this case, but to my knowledge have not improved it. Now they offer to send me a new clip holder and a new silicone protector free if I send in pictures of the loose silicone rim. I'm debating whether it's worth it or not for two months of function before the clip breaks without me being aware of it and possibly causes me to lose the phone. I am investigating other phone cases with belt clips and/or loops, but will be watching to see if Otterbox improves the design and materials in the Defender in the future. I'm an Otterbox fan, and love the protection the Defender provides my phone, but would be hesitant to buy the current model. My wife's phone is enclosed in an excellent Otterbox Commuter case, but it doesn't provide quite as much impact resistance, and doesn't have a belt clip option.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review330" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-21:</strong> I bought this for my iphone that i just got because the case on it before was too thin because I tend to drop my phone constantly.

My girlfriend and I have been purchasing otterboxes for the past few years with our new phones and I have to give them Thumbs UP.  Good job on creating a case that is pretty much resistant to everything.Now on to the review;Quality: 5 StarsAesthetics: 5 StarsUsability: 5 StarsSeparate than the actual defender case so...Packaging: 3 stars (no instructions??) youtube iPhone 5 Otterbox Defender CaseQuality: With The Defender case you can be assured your product (iPhone 5) will stay in tip top shape.  The durable case will hold up to just about anything.Aesthetics: this thing is pretty awesome looking. Like if you had a transformer come to earth and replicate itself into an iPhone w/ defender case.  Pretty rugged but also comes in pinks and other colors for those ladies that wish it. Be sure to realize the case is THICK. You will lose the 'sleek' look of the iPhone 5 in this beast.Usability: I am able to use all ports and buttons with ease. Appears to be no problem w/ the dimensions nor design.  Comes w/ a handy holster if you are into that or you can still slide it into a pocket (man sized in my case, some women may want a more slender casing)Packaging: what a pain in the bottom to figure out how to open an otterbox!  You have to dig your finger nails up under the top of the casing where the rubber material meets the hard plastic in order to 'pull' the cover off and then move down the plastic casing while still pulling the rubber casing off.  Once this is done, you are easily able to figure out the rest.  Be sure to wipe your phone off and spray it with a can of air to get all the dust off and finger prints off.  Either way, just youtube it if you get stuck.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review342" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-07:</strong> Work upgraded me to an iPhone 5 and I immediately ordered this.

I decided on the Defender vs the next version up after reading all the reviews. I am so glad I did! The version I had before had the rubber shell that made it difficult to get in and out of pockets. This version works great. I have seen NONE of the problems that others have reported about the covers for the plugs or typing on the screen.

I knew what I was receiving when purchasing, so I was confident it would protect the my new $299.99 purchase. I was especially in a hurry to get a case after the whole 'scuffgate' ordeal.I've noticed a few improvements.I think the material used to cover 'ports' is of a slightly, just slightly more stronger material. I managed to rip off my 4's defender port immediately, so far so good on this.The ports covers plug in much easier, I know in my previous two defender cases, I had to fight to get the port covers to go back into place, and even then they would not stay. In this new IPhone 5 case, it works great.They removed the ability for the holster to 'rachet' or move. It's in a fixed 90 degree position now. (I found this was a positive myself, I hated going to retrieve my phone and it would be in an odd position.)NegativesI don't have fingernails, and I find it hard to open any of the port covers at any time. I usually have to peel back the silicone casing near the port cover I'm trying to open to get a grip, or use a pen. Extra secure, or over secure?The only other slight change is that the opening on the front camera/microphone and the back camera/flash is kind of big. It could discourage a lot of people. I personally feel that it'd be pretty hard to drop the phone leave those portions exposed during a drop (maybe a corner!) It does leave some spacing for your fingerprints on the face/back of the phone, as well as.. possibly maybe dust or crumbs to slip under the film for the touch screen as there is no film on these two openings.Overall, I feel confident that my phone is protected in my Otterbox defender case, and although the price is a bit steep, I feel that it is worth protecting my investment. The white silicone case compliments my black phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review362" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-24:</strong> My son recommended this OtterBox Defender for my new iPhone 5.  He certainly knows more about these things than I do, and this time his recommendation was right on the money.  This is a very high quality case for the iPhone 5.  The fit is impeccable -- it literally fits the iPhone 5 like a glove.  Basically this case is a hard plastic case surrounded by a rubberized outer housing that affords an excellent grip and which should cushion the iPhone 5 from the inevitable drops and jostling to which we all subject our iPhones. The lip around the screen is very well-recessed which should protect the screen protector from getting scratched if you set the iPhone down face-down, as we all sometimes do.  The case looks very professional.This case also comes with a built in screen protector.  My iPhone 5 already had a standard peel-on screen protector that I have chosen not to remove, but even with two layers of protection the touchscreen on the iPhone 5 works perfectly.  The rubberized surface for the on/off switch and the control button on the iPhone 5 work perfectly as well.  There are cut-outs for the front and rear camera lenses so no problem there.There is a rubberized fitting that fits over the lightning connector that is well-designed and which protects the connector.  Personally I probably would have been happy if the OtterBox simply left the connector unprotected, but in practice this arrangement works out well.About the only negative for this case is the inevitable fact that it adds a certain amount of bulk to the iPhone 5 as the price you pay for first-rate protection.  That is fine with me but if you are one of those folks who really insists upon having the slimmest iPhone possible this case may not be for you.  This case is definitely for me as I value the protection and like the appearance and utility of this case.The flip side of the extra bulk that this case imparts to the iPhone is that I like the heft of the phone when talking on it.  And while the OtterBox makes the phone larger, it adds very little weight, so that the iPhone 5 even in this case is a pretty lightweight accessory.  Nice.The Amazon price is a bargain.  Recommended.

The outer casing is a material that provides a great level of grip, but does not attract lint and dust like the older ones did.  The fit is incredibly snug.  I bout a cheaper case taht claimed to be the same as the Otterbox, and I hated it because it did not fit as tightly and attracted lint.  The case adds a little size and weight to the phone, but with the iPhone 5 I think that is a good thing.  The phone itself is so light that I am afraid of dropping it.  These cases will make your phone virtually indestructible, which is the whole point of course.  The only draw back to the Defender is that there is a tendency for an &#34;oil slick&#34; looking spot to develop between the phone screen and the clear protector.  This has been documented all over the internet.  The official explanation is that it is caused by static electricity.  I have read a lot of info that baby powder will keep it from appearing, but that has not worked for me.  I also read about rubbing a dryer sheet on the glass--this just smeared and looked terrible.  The Otterbox Commuter gives side and back protection, but not as much to the front.  This might be a good alternative for you if you can't handle the oily spot.  One would think that Otterbox could come up with something to combat or prevent this.  But if you want to keep your phone safe from drops, I have dropped mine on concrete and asphalt with the Defender, and the phone has been undamaged every time.  It does its job very well.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review370" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-12:</strong> This case is great.

I love how it covers the front of the phone and has a built in, easily detachable screen protector. No phone cases have that! There are a few downsides, though. First, it can trap a lot of dust in certain crevices. Second, I wish the inside case was rubber and the outside was plastic. People have said that the plastic case scratches their phone. Lastly, with the update, it's really hard to swipe up for the quick-access menu. But, overall, i've dropped my phone several times on concrete and it's perfectly fine!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review371" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-20:</strong> Awesome price alot cheaper then the stores and it came in 2days great great great love iti would definitely recommend it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review372" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-16:</strong> The screen protector doesn't fit nicely onto the screen, leaving some type of oil-looking mark.

Because of the added protection, he did not mind that it was bulky or the gap between the screen and the clear face plate. He was initially very satisfied by the improved design and finish over the previous model. Within 6 months however, the clear screen was so scratched, fogged, and damaged that it was hard to see through. He only used screen cleaner or rubbing alcohol to clean the case and phone. Within 8 months, the outer silicone case has stretched out of shape enough to gap all of the way around and only fits snugly over the home button. By a year later, two of the silicone tabs that fit over openings like the charging port and mute button have torn completely off. He uses his phone a lot and carries it daily but he is not rough with it. The most wear likely comes from put the phone in and out of his pockets. In comparison, I have been using the Speck Smartflex View (moderate protection case with built in kickstand) continually since December 2013. My case is still in good shape. I don't mean to imply that the Speck case can provide as good of protection in all circumstances as the Otterbox but it has held up well and has seen a lot more handling than my husband's case. He still continues to use this case with the clear plastic face plate replaced by a screen protector.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review382" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-08:</strong> I LOVE OtterBox!

I owned the blue iphone 4 otterbox defender case and was extremely happy with it, but this newer version for the iphone 5 is even better. The rubber that covers the inner plastic shell is a lot harder, meaning it doesnt wiggle around. It is a little bit tougher to pull off and put on, but it gives that extra protection that I'm looking for. its also made a little different than the rubber outing compared to the iphone 4 defender case, making it easy to put into your pant pockets as well as making it easy to pull out. the one downside i can think of is that the front camera and receiver are exposed, as well as the back camera, flash and mic. in the previous defender case series, these were covered by a see through window. so if you've used your previous iphone 4 otterbox defender case in some light right, you would of been ok, but this new version has those areas exposed. But with the iphone 5, you dont need to look at ur iphone to respond to texts or to post to twitter/facebook, you have siri to do that for you, even to write emails.another big improvement is the clipcase that houses the defender casing. Its built a lot better to hold your otter box in place while its clipped to your waist line. I didnt used the previous one because it just didnt feel like it would hold my iphone 4 in place in the belt clip.All in all, this is a huge step up in quality, with that one minor issue, but its definitely worth a purchase. Oh this defender case is actually thinner than the iPhone 4 defender case, and doesnt feel as heavy. hope this helps you all.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review386" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-04:</strong> Great high quality true Otterbox brand.

Now I know the new iPhone 5 design is part of the reason for how they built this case but compared to the iPhone 4/4s case this is a super star winner and the old case is crap. And by the way the old case is not crap, this case is just that much nicer.The soft outer bit seems more solid and doesn't feel like it will slowly come undone by wearing out. The dock port cover is stronger and doesn't seems like it will come apart. The case feels ,ore solid than before as we'll.

Its amazingly much thinner and stronger than the previous Defender cases.4)  The front and rear cameras are wide open so that the case will not interfere with flash or cause any unwanted vignette.Con:1)  It is extremely hard to open and the port covers for all ports (mute button port, charging port, and ear phones port).2) It is difficult to access the mute button.  The case has a tiny opening to access the mute button & makes it difficult for a person like me with big fingers to mute my phone.2) The built-in screen protector reduces the image quality of the retina display.  (This can be resolved easily by removing the Otterbox screen protector itself. It sounds crazy, but you will love your iPhone and Defender case much more.  The native iPhone screen is already extremely anti-scratch resistant, finger smudge resistant with a tempered glass.  Ive never had problems or scratches on my screen. The built in screen protector for the Defender case may be redundant and not worth losing the image quality on your screen.)I definitely recommend this case to any iPhone user.  If you want a thinner case and not have the difficulty of 'breaking into Fort Knox' to access your ports, I would suggest looking at Speck Cases.  They manufacture lighter and thinner cases that also give excellent protection, but not as superior as the Otterbox.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review400" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-01:</strong> I have had my Otterbox Defender case for over 3 months now and it hasn't let me down yet!My iPhone is in perfect condition and doesn't have a scratch or mark on it.One thing that can be somewhat troublesome is that you can scratch the screen protector, but Otterbox does allowyou to send a picture of your case and tell them whats wrong with it, and they will send you a new one, for free!The case fits perfectly inside your hand both horizontally and vertically.  I really enjoy the new feel/material used on the back rather than the older ones.

I have gone through 2 other otterbox defenders for the iPhone 5 and was a bit hesitant to even bother trading the 2nd one in for a 3rd one via warranty replacement.The first one I received quickly failed on the top left/right plastic insert the actual phone sits in. It would not clasp together anymore and I had to send it in. Also the built in screen protector became detached from the housing and let a lot of dust in. First OB gone.The second one I received the holster clip that the actual case clipped into made the silicon housing tear a bit. Also with both when I would plug the phone in to charge it seemed like there was a little play inside the case and you could actually shake the case and hear the iPhone sliding around inside of it.Third time...ITS THE CHARM. On this one the screen protector has stayed in place and even is sitting flush with the screen, so no little poof or getting used to having to hit the screen a bit harder when texting. Also there is no play inside the case and it even feels a lot more sturdy. The plastic housing snaps in place perfect and and even makes a snapping sound that sets my mind at ease. The one thing I noticed as well as on the other cases they said made in china somewhere on them and this one inside the case, and even on the clip says USA. Does the China versus USA assembly have something to do with the difference? I would say so in this case.Definitely recommend this case to anyone. It is leaps and bounds better than the case for the 4 and much slimmer. The silicone is a higer grade and does not loosen from obsorbing the oils on your hands.Definitely a 5 star product!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review416" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-14:</strong> Protects my phone very well, but I find it very difficult to put on and take off.

I do not carry insurance through my service provider, because with an Otterbox I feel it is not needed. The $7 a month I save in insurance fees has already paid for my Otterbox case. The color is very unassuming, so if you like a flashy case you might choose a different color combination, but for me the grey/white is exactly what I wanted.

She loves purple and loves Otterbox so it seemed like a no-brainer. All was good for a few weeks, but then the rubber portion of this case started to stretch and flop around. It no longer stays in its little tracks around the plastic portion of the case, and frankly it looks like hell.  Not sure if we got a bad batch of material or what. The case for her iPod is still going strong after around a year's use, but this case started showing problems within the first month. I don't think she's putting any undue stress or wear on the case - she hasn't yet taken it back out since the initial installation so it's not that. The only thing she does with it is stick it in the back pocket of her jeans. I'd expect an Otterbox to be able to handle that and not stretch out of all proportion to itself but that does not seem to be the case.We're going to be contacting Otterbox for a replacement - hopefully it will be an easy process and the new one will far outlast the original.

It makes the phone huge and bulky, and it just doesn't look good. The silicone exterior is too sticky.But the OB Commuter is the perfect compromise. It is sleek and looks good without adding too much bulk. And it offers superior protection. This is the perfect case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review442" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-26:</strong> The cover protects the phone while still allowing the screen to be sensitive to touch, unlike the Ballastic case I had before this.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review443" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-29:</strong> From the standpoint of pure protection, I would give this a 5.  I have dropped my phone several times with absolutely no effect on the phone or the case.  Easy to assemble.  Like all Otterbox Defender cases, it seems high quality.  It does add bulk to the slim IPhone, but I knew that before I bought it.  I'm ok with the form factor.  All buttons are covered by the case, but I found the effect on the clickability of the buttons to be miniscule.  Also, the outer screen protector built into the case has only a minor (almost unnoticeable)  effect on the sensitivity of the touch screen.  Overall, well designed.I do have 2 complaints thought.  First, somehow moisture or condensation gets between the outer screen protector and the actual IPhone screen itself.  The result, at least for me, is that I get strange rainbow effects on the screen or the screen protector (can't tell which, and it doesn't matter, the effect is the same).  It's more of an annoyance than a major flaw, as the effects are relatively minor, and sometimes not even noticeable, depending on what is on the screen at the time, how the light is hitting the screen, etc.  Still, I do notice them from time to time, and they are slightly distracting. Second complaint is that the screen protector gets pretty dirty pretty easily pretty quickly. I am constantly having to clean the screen, more so than when the phone is not in the case.  Not sure why this is the case, but it just is.Am I keeping the case?  Yes.  Would I buy a different case if I had it to do over again?  Probably not, although it would be close.  For me, solid protection is the main reason I bought the case in the first place, and as noted above, I give this case a 5 for protection. My other complaints are relatively minor, but still, an irritation factor.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review444" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-01:</strong> Thank god for Otterbox!

Firstly because buying a good case is a lot cheaper than potentially haveing to replace the phone, I can be rough on my phones and it makes me feel more confident holding my phone while doing demanding activities because I am not as worried about dropping my phone or getting it scratched. This particular otterbox offers the highest level of protection the company offers. I like the fact that it does not add a ton of "bulkyness," to the device while still being pretty protective.There are disapointing aspects though. Firstly the case was not made as well as it could have been. There was some access rubber that had not been properly removed during production. The case seems to become weaker and does not fit together as it did the first time if you take it on and off your phone a few times. Also, the part of the phone that would touch the phone in the front above and around the screen is just solid plastic. It would be nice to have a rubber coating there to increase shock absorbsion and make sure the sureface of the phone is not scratched. Otterbox definitly has a superior product and they know that due to the high demand. For what it is, it is extremly overpriced but considering supply and demand it seems to be working out for the company. It just sucks knowing that I paid a lot more for a product than it is actually worth to get the "otterbox." I had a case on my droid x2 made by Incipio that was a full silicone case and then it had a second stage that was hard plastic that fit around the rubber. It was almost identicle to an otterbox, I found it on amazon for $12 I think and it lasted 2 years and is still in great shape and I have dropped my phone quite a bit; no scratches or anything on the phone. Overall though, good product and worth it considering the cost of replacing the actual phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0090YGJ4I" id="B0090YGJ4I-review448" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-06:</strong> I got one of these for my wifes Android phone about 2 years ago.

Previous to this, it has been a requirement for me that a new phone should have a BodyGlove case available for it if I were to buy it.I could not get the case to snap shut on the phone. It was not obvious to me how to do it, and there were no instructions included. The construction of the case was not as sturdy as other BodyGlove cases that I have used. The plastic was flimsy compared to the stitched leather that I was used to. I did not have confidence that it could protect a $500 phone from drops. There is no padding inside the case. BodyGlove may be irrelevant in the smartphone generation. The construction techniques that worked with soap-bar phones with small screens just don't apply to a phone that is all screen.I bought a rubber skin for my phone and a horizontal pouch case. This provides the kind of protection that I was looking for. BodyGlove was good to me while it lasted. I'm sorry to see it end.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003YWFAYC" id="B003YWFAYC-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-03-19:</strong> Don't you love the free market and the positive competition it provides for!&lt;Disclaimer> SF|Planet was kind enough to add a small note asking for a positive review, making absolutely sure I was 100% satisfied, and links for other products.&lt;/Disclaimer>That having been said, I was genuinely satisfied and will gladly review SF|Planet first, the product second.I got the item when they promised.

I am very impressed with the quality and design. It is first rate.2. The clip/stand is a cool idea. I've been hesitant to use belt clip cell holders because of past brush by tear-offs, but this one feels more secure.3. The rubberized grip back is awesome. It doesn't hang up in the pocket of my jacket, but has enough tack to make an otherwise slippery phone very usable now.4.

After a couple of scrapes on the glass screen (I've never scraped a screen before - always owned iPhones) I decided to put away the cheap case options and go for the tried and true.  I ended up with the Otterbox Defender for the Active and I am pleased.  I DO have an extra battery for my phone and changing out batteries will be a hassle, but that is one I am willing to deal with in order to gain the two layer protection that Otterbox provides.I've been using Otterboxes for the past 4 years and they have continued to evolve and listen to customer feedback.  The result is a well fitting, well made product that is usable in all respects.  Usability when being put on the device and usability when the device is in use.  All of the buttons and the screen are responsive.  The earphone flap fits nice and snug back in it's spot.Everything just fits and works.  Great holster as usual and a great case at a great price (the gray / white was considerably cheaper than the straight black ... so I went for that one).The case looks nice on the Active and will provide the protection I have come to expect from Otter.  I THOUGHT the Active would be a little more rugged ... but I was wrong.  It may have a look that pretends to be ruggedized, but it is not.  Put a case on it and it will fare better.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DQNZ1CU" id="B00DQNZ1CU-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-12:</strong> The belt clip doesn't completely cover the protective case.However I like the way it protects my phone but I'm afraid to simplyclip it on my belt.

If you're at all careless with your phone, this is the case to have. The inner case comes in two halves that snap together VERY securely. Getting it apart to change the battery or add an microSD card is really difficult. The face of the inner case has a clear, hard plastic screen protector. Make sure the phone screen and the inner side of the case protector are really, really clean before you assemble the halves. Otherwise, you'll discover just how difficult they are to get apart. The outer case is molded rubber that entirely covers the back and sides of the case, and wraps around to lock on the front. The case is available in several color combinations. OtterBox doesn't advertise this case as being waterproof, but it will certainly withstand full immersion long enough to be quickly retrieved from a toilet bowl or sink and a subsequent rinse-off. We have 6 Otterbox Defender Series cases -- 4 for various phones and two for tablets. I wouldn't buy any other.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00DQNZ1CU', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00DQNZ1CU', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B0096L2UDY</h2>    <p class="price"> $B0096L2UDY</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0096L2UDY" id="B0096L2UDY-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-13:</strong> I love these covers!

It didn't have the best reviews but it had a long arm that would fit my desired height well in my 2007 Toyota Matrix. The lighter socket power no longer works because of it so I'm glad my car has a second one I can charge the phone from. The plastic adjustment base and the socket dock both do not hold as tightly as they should so if I bump it or turn hard, the arm and phone hit my steering wheel or fall in the other direction. I'm constantly adjusting it. The movable feet that hold the phone in place are too loose. My phone has fallen to the floor many times from the feet moving out of the way when I'm putting it in. I've been meaning to add Sugru all over this device to make it more solid.The height is perfect for what I was looking for and the phone release button works great. I haven't found a better solution yet so I'm still using it. If you have an extra socket in your car to charge from if it breaks yours, it might fit what your looking for. The 2007 Toyota Matrix doesn't have much vertical dash open space, a close enough windshield, or high cup holders to use a lot of the other mounts at a good height so this one works for that.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00D4ON4S4" id="B00D4ON4S4-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-21:</strong> I had purchased the competitor version and it worked real good but I needed a more universal item for larger phone, this one came thru.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00D4ON4S4', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00D4ON4S4', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00E89FFO0</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00E89FFO0</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00E89FFO0" id="B00E89FFO0-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-08:</strong> This phone is complete JUNK!

So do not bother wasting your time or money buying this worthless stylus. It is not universal, does not respond to any other Samsung device. Or any other touch device. Not only will you be out your shipping money; they make you pay to send back the device to receive your refund, but then, you are now out money shipping the device back to get a refund. I spent more in shipping the device, that I could have bought two of the items. The customer service,if you could call it that spent weeks ignoring my inquiries about why the stylus wouldn't work, responding only with; tell me the make and model of your phone, which I did, repeatedly. It was only until I mentioned involving Amazon in the return process that they finally responded as to why the device didn't work on my American phone. They then sent me the address to return the item, at my own expense.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00B93LTSO" id="B00B93LTSO-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-18:</strong> Doesn't work as well as I thought it would,  being that is says it's for samsung galaxy s4.

What the heck? Epic fail!Also, after five days/600 miles worth of driving, I have found its power rating to be meaningless. Why? While it does charge the iPhone quite rapidly, it works it's way out of the socket far too easily! I find myself having to re-seat this charger back into the socket every few minutes and it seems every time I glance at it, it has worked its way out of the socket. I have many iPhone chargers and universal chargers I have purchased ranging from $1.99 chargers to $30 chargers in the never-ending search for a good charger which does more than a mediocre job of filtering out both alternator and ECU noise without introducing "motorboating" from ground loops. This charger would be almost satisfactory, if only it did not try to jump out of the socket in my SAAB. No other charger I have tried, ranging from cheap $1.99 to quality $30 chargers have proven so stubborn.Also, the strain reliever on the USB cable has already cracked, revealing the aluminum outer conductor, and the unit has not even been exposed to below-freezing temperatures yet!!Lastly, while the green LED in the VGA matches the green lighting in my SAAB almost perfectly, it is obnoxiously bright. I would live to throttle whoever decided it was a good idea to throw ultra-bright LEDs in every electronic device! I am findingI have to paint over the LEDs on almost everything I buy with black, blue, or purple nail polish in order to subdue the light.Skiva, please fix your product. I expected far better for the price, and based on your product description.Rated it a 1 because it is already falling apart, it fails to stay seated in the socket, and it failed to deliver on its promise to filter out all noise.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004YTRZFQ" id="B004YTRZFQ-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-10:</strong> Nice charger.

It does have many features that I'll never use, (using the phone on Page Plus Wireless is limited), but it's a nice feature filled phone. The only drawback I have with it is that the battery life is a bit short. To get around the short battery life, I have disable some of the constant updates that uses data and turn them on only when I need updates. I did notice that when the data is off the picture text didn't work. I now leave the data on all the time.

Wifi is set to only 25% and its still V fast if on the N setting 15Mb down and up. I have not rooted it yet, but I am sure once I do it will be faster.

Flatbed scanners lose track of where they were on the page. Printer servers seem to lose their jobs somewhere in vaporspace. Seriously, her idea of high tech is a digital children's thermometer...A couple years ago, the kids and I helped her migrate from the realm of flip phones to the smart phone world, and the Samsung Illusion is the phone that the kids picked out for her as a birthday gift. It was the right choice for the job -- not too complex, not too many bells & whistles, just the right size for her somewhat petite hands, and easy to navigate. Of course, she jumped head first into texting with family and friends.It took her a few months to put away her paper address book and start to use the phone's Contacts functionality. Took even longer for her to get comfortable using the Illusion to check and send email. Now she's progressed to taking and sharing pictures, reading and sending work files and other pdfs, and using Google Navigator.Yes, she is finally on her way in the smart phone world. Now if she would only get comfortable remembering to take her phone with her wherever she goes, and stop putting it back into her purse (... and then taking it back out again, over & over) each and every time she sends and receives individual texts.One thing that we did notice is that the charge on the original battery lasted, on average, a little over one day. That battery died a few weeks ago, after about two years, and the Samsung OEM replacement purchased on Amazon (Li-Ion Polymer OEM Replacement Battery (1500mAh) for Samsung Illusion (EB484659YZ)) has been fantastic. We think the charge on this one lasts even longer than the initial one did.If you are looking for a good starter smart phone that is reasonably priced and easy to use, we highly recommend that you consider the Samsung Illusion based on our experience with it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006HXJ40G" id="B006HXJ40G-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-28:</strong> Very simple.

My wife recently just got hers. I have been using the white uag case since it came out a few months back and I love it. The only reason I am giving this pink one 4 stars is that when I got the pink one in the mail for my wife's phone the case was more flimsy than my white one and it was loose on my wife's s3. It actually was so loose you could see the edge of the phone on the bottom. It seemed like it was warped somehow like in the sun. That's the best way I could explain it. Well I contacted uag directly from their website and they sent me a replacement under warranty and am very happy to report the replacement fits nice and snug like my original white one I have on my phone.

It was clear that for this one, she needed something that would protect the phone against painful drops so I began my search for a good case.  It came down to this one and an otterbox.  The otterbox had excellent reviews and I have heard that most people like them.  But, after reading that the otterbox had small flaps for all the input ports, I ended up going with this one.  My wife finds those flaps irritating as we had them on a previous set of phones years ago.  Not having flaps, and being pink won out, and we purchased this item. We couldn't be happier.  She has dropped it a couple of times already, and it's perfectly fine, there is a tiny scratch on the case, not noticeable unless you are really looking for it.I would say the only con is that it is extremely difficult to remove and put on the case.  The corners are rubberized, and flex to allow it, but it is difficult.  Over time I assume this will loosen and be a little easier, but I like to remove and clean under the case every now and then.. Also, we have a spare batter for when we are out and about away from electricity for a while.I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is interested in protection for their expensive smartphone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009FXMWIG" id="B009FXMWIG-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-01:</strong> Just got this for our new samsung S3,the fitting is great,connecting wires no problems,looks well built,but havent dropped the phone yet.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009FXMWIG" id="B009FXMWIG-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-13:</strong> Light weight and very tuff.

It's got a smooth aluminum look to it with two ports (one 2.1 and one 1.1).  It works great as a charger.  It has 4 led lights that indicate the life of the battery and flash during charging. I noticed that it can scratch so I'd be careful with sharp metal objects.  This also has a flash light.  It's not that bright but great if you are in a bind for some extra light.I was able to charge my Samsung Note 2 more than 2x.  The charge was quick on the 2.1 amp - about 1 percent per minute.

But, since I don't have one of those, it is just as well. :-)It is heavier than I expected - over 13 ounces - but it has all of the power you could want! Te two ports (one is 1A and the other is 2.1A) are clearly marked on the top! Clearly marked! As I can read them without my glasses or a magnifying glass!Many batteries that I have tested come with a cord that has a plug on top for all devices. This one comes with a micro cord (used for charging the battery and devices) AND clips that fit over the micro end to convert it to lightning and 30 pin for Apple products.The flashlight is a tiny LED bulb and could be used to light things up in an emergency, but it would not be practical to carry given the size and weight. But the flashlight aspect is always appreciated.Best of all, it actually has understandable instructions.The one thing of note is that the one I received has a turquoise rather than light blue color .. very classy.I received a complimentary sample to test for a review.

This battery holds its charge well so far.12,000 mAh is a lot of power for an external battery, especially of this weight.  The rechargeable battery for my iPad 3 holds 11,560 mAh.  So this battery is more powerful than that of my iPad 3 by a little.  Our iPhone 5 battery holds up to 1,440 mAh, so this external battery will power it for a number of days.Finally, I like the sleek appearance and colors of this battery.

It's pretty compact considering it has a 12000mAh capacity, measuring roughly 3 inches wide and six inches tall. It's about 5/8 inches thick. The size, plus the fact that it weighs 11.1 ounces, makes this rather large for carrying in a pocket. However, it slips into a tablet carry case without a problem. Given that the capacity is something best suited to a tablet, I don't find the size at all objectionable.The case feels metal-like, but it is plastic. The build quality is excellent - it feels solid, and the case has a matte finish that looks good and hides fingerprints perfectly. It has a rounded profile making it easy to put into, and pull out of, a laptop or tablet bag without it getting snagged on anything.All the ports are at the top end. There are two USB output ports (one is 1A; one is 2.1A), a micro USB input port for charging, and a LED flashlight. It has the usual LED "gas gauge" to show the power level left. The LED indicators are blue, easily seen, but don't blind you like other indicators I've seen. The on/off button is on the side, sticks out enough so it can be easily found, and has a positive click so you know the press has been registered.My only quibble is that the port output ratings are sliver on sliver, making them hard to read. Black text would have been a better approach.Zero complaints with performance.It's a good choice if you're looking for a large capacity powerbank that has a slim (for the capacity) profile and solid build quality. Highly recommend.[Sample provided for review]</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IKEVZSO" id="B00IKEVZSO-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-01:</strong> The bottom line on the Onite battery is this: it works. In the past I've tried several different reserve power supplies for my gadgets, and I have had mixed results. However, there is no ambiguity about this battery: it's large, effective, versatile and well designed. It's one of the largest external battery that I've come across in terms of capacity (with whopping 12,000 mAh of charge), and yet it's much smaller in size than some of its larger near-competitors.In order to test this battery charger I decided to completely drain my small electronic devices so that I get as clean of an idea of this battery's efficiency as I can. (As an aside, when you really want to discharge them, the consumer electronics has become really robust in recent year. It took me much longer than I thought it would. I had to blast music from my iPhone for hours and hours ...) I discover that I was able to fully charge all of my small electronic devices with plenty of power to spare. Most of them I was able to charge several times, and thanks to dual USB ports, was able to charge up to two devices at once. Full charging usually takes between one to two hours. I've tested this battery with iPhone 5S, iPhone 4S,iPhone 3G,Kindle Keyboard, Kindle Paperwhite,Mobee Magic Bar,Jabra SPORT Bluetooth Stereo Headset, and the first generationiPad (32GB, Wifi + 3G). Oftentimes I was able to fully charge four or five devices with just one fully charged Onite battery. I was also able to charge my iPad completely, and even charge it to almost half its capacity the second time around. If there was an easy way of connecting this battery to an ultrabook I would not be surprised if it would be possible to charge it to a decent amount as well.The battery comes with an AC charger, micro USB cable, iPhone 30-pin adapter and an Apple lightning adapter. The inclusion of iPhone adapter is very convenient for those of us in the iOS land - most manufacturers of these batteries just assume that we'll bring our own cables.This Onite battery is also beautifully designed. You would not be ashamed of being spotted with this battery at a trendy tech conference. The battery is very easy to use and operate, and overall vey intuitively designed.I am very pleased and impressed with this rechargeable external battery. It is effective, portable, and very affordable. I would recommend it to anyone who travels a lot or uses their gadgets on the go all the time. It can even be carried around in your messenger bag during your daily commute - it will not add that much extra weight.***** Review product provided by the manufacturer. *****</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IKEVZSO" id="B00IKEVZSO-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-20:</strong> Hits the sweet spot in power banksThe Onite Pandora 12,000 mAh power bank hits the sweet spot, combining high capacity, attractive design, and excellent manufacturing quality, all at an excellent value.The case is brushed aluminum with end caps of ABS, the same plastic Legos are made of.  I&#8217;m guessing that it is manufactured in a factory alongside cell phones or laptops because of the way it&#8217;s built.It has all the standard features one would expect, such as a four-LED capacity display, both 1.0 and 2.1 A ports, and smart circuitry.  However, it also has a built-in LED flashlight of moderate strength that will be quite handy when travelling or in an emergency and as a bonus, charging tips for both iPhone 4 and 5 are included.The 12,000 mAh battery will provide at least 9,600 mAh of usable capacity, using a conservative 80% efficiency factor.  That will recharge an iPhone 5 or Kindle Paperwhite at least six times and even fully recharge an iPad air or give a big boost to a notebook.No complaints at all about this power bank. It is even delivered fully charged!Sample provided for testing and unbiased review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IKEVZSO" id="B00IKEVZSO-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-16:</strong> The Onite 12000mAh power bank is probably one of the best on the market right now for price, size and power.  It's about the size of a Samsung Galaxy and lightweight enough make for perfect long distance traveling whether in a car or plane or train.This Power Bank will charge just about anything.  It comes with a charger USB link for your computer, but whatever smartphone or tablet you own (Apple included), you probably have the needed adapter.  Also included are a `lighting pin' adapter and a `lighting pin to 30-pin adapter'.  The power bank came fully charged and when depleted, took about five-six hours to fully charge. When I attached my iPad mini and my iPhone 4S, and both were at 20% power, they both recharged in about four hours. I would imagine that an iPad would solely charge in about the same time.There are two USB ports that can power or charge: USB port 1 provides 1A, whereas USB port 2 .1 A. You can also charge the power bank while it is you are using one.  There is also a small emergency light that comes on when the small power button is pushed.  This is more of a novelty, but could supply enough light, say, in a glove compartment at night.The power bank cell is a Polymer lithium battery encased in an aluminum light blue shell.  The power is indicated by the presence of four tiny bright blue LED lights representing 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% power.  I love this high capacity power bank as I can take it on a trip and it will last the length of the trip.  It will power my iPhone 4S about five times completely and my iPad2 about two times.  It's great to have on a coast to coast plane trip. I never worry about having enough power.  I also wait until the bank is down to 25% before I recharge it.  For the price and the quality and length of battery power, this is one of the better power banks.

What sets this one apart is the price, which at thirty bucks at the time of this review is a bargain, and capacity. I put the review sample I received through its paces and it passed all of the test points I normally check.First, the battery itself charges in about twelve hours, which is fairly quick for one at this capacity.  Second, it fast charged both my Galaxy Note 3 phone and my Samsung Tab 3 10.1 simultaneously. The Note 3 is not much of a challenge, but the Tab 3 is on the power hungry side and is slow to charge off of anything other than the wall charger it shipped with. So that alone won me over and inspired me to give it five stars.The form factor is on the large side, but as a desk charger it is not an issue. I would not recommend lugging it around in a purse or pocket. I love the aluminum exterior which is not only attractive, but serves a purpose.As for capacity, I always multiply the claimed capacity by .9 because batteries lose some in the charging process, as well as being affected by temperature, the age of the battery itself and even the cable you use. Using my formula I am approximating the effective capacity of this out of the box to be 10800 mAh, which is still enough capacity to charge an iPhone 5S with its internal 1440mAh battery 7.5 times.It's also more than 3 times the capacity of my Note 3's 3300mAh battery, and slightly over 90% of the capacity of an iPad 2's 11,560mAh battery and 1.5 times the capacity of the 6800mAh battery in my Samsung Tab 3.The above boosts in the use time of the devices I cited are impressive, especially if you are a power user with a phone and tablet and are on the go. I love mine and have been using it steadily since I received it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IKEVZSO" id="B00IKEVZSO-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-30:</strong> This is a beautiful power bank.  It's sleek . . . a pretty shade of matte blue, which means it resists fingerprints and doesn't mar easily.  The Onite is capable of charging up to two tablets at once.  Alternatively, it can give the Kindle Fire HD 8.9" tablet a full charge with a little bit of juice left over.The only drawback is the size.  It's big and heavy - the size of a large cell phone but thicker and weighs more like a brick - but that's what you get when you want more power.  I dare a lipstick power bank to match its performance.Make sure to press the power button and hold to start charging.  Other power banks may begin charging the minute anything is plugged in, or they only take a short press of the power button.  This one is different.  Before you think it's defective (like yours truly), press and hold.  Double press the power button and you get the LED flash light.  It's good in a pinch but not really practical.This product was provided for review by Onite.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IKEVZSO" id="B00IKEVZSO-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-10:</strong> When you are looking at a power bank, you look at multiple factors. Key parameters are as follows:- Functionality (what is mAH and how long it takes to charge)- Durability (how durable)- Portability (size, look and feel)In these respects this charger performed very well in all aspects. Packaging is very good and a non-frustration type package. This has TWO USB port and one microUSB port. You connect the USB cable to microUSB and charge the device. You should connect the cable to regular USB and other end to phones/phablets/tablets etc.This power bank comes in a stylish aluminum case. The box comes with a USB cable and also an adapter for iPhone 30 pin. I have charged multiple devices using this- Samsung Galaxy S4 phones- Samsung Galaxy Tab PRO 12.2&#34;The microUSB is used to charge this powerbank and the USB itself to charge other devices. I had no issue charging these with the External Battery power bank. 12000 mAh is strong enough to charge the phones multiple times.Overall excellent value and great powerbank.

He is known to lose chargers & USB cables for his previous phone. Also has always had trouble with hard cases properly fitting phones he has had even though he bought them through our mobile carrier or the brand make/model cases sold in stores. This hard cover case fit his phone as to perfection! It looks as if it is built onto the phone, but does not infringe upon the use of side buttons or any slots/openings. Has not cracked & showed it could protect when he dropped it for the first time onto a concrete driveway! Extra accessories......HALLELUJAH! They all work & came packaged very well. Screen protectors...bonus! No scratches! Even if you are getting a new phone with all of these accessories included (as he did), order a 2nd/back-up set. So Affordable & so worth it.

The one I used most is the white one.I like the dual armor design.  A few months into using it, the phone fell face down on a floor tier.  I was very pleased that there was not a single scratch.  That would pay for the cover already.However, after a few weeks, it becomes obvious that the outer shell is too heavy and too rigid.  The material is not as light-weight as the one OtterBox uses, and it does not flex at all.  Then I managed to get some water on the outer shell, and the faux rubber paint starts to peel.  The smooth rubbery paint becomes winkled, revealing the cheap plastic material underneath.  For the white color, some turns to brown and dark, whereas pealed paint reveals plastics.The inner rubber is also too thick.  It is after some use that my hands and wrists start to hurt.  It dawned on me that the cover are too thick.  It completely changes the phone's form factor, and the hard outer shell is not ergonomically friendly to constant hand-held use.  The phone itself is already wide, adding several mm thinkness to both side, with a hard shell, it hurts the ring finger, and strains the bottom of the thumb.In summery, it protects the phone against abuse, but the outer shell is a tad too thick and really hard to press, which could hurt your hand for long-term use.  Once the paint of the outer shell starts to peel after exposed to excessive humidity, it looks ugly, and feels very cheap.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00B4I2GJU" id="B00B4I2GJU-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-30:</strong> Well made, sharp looking case that protects well!

I've been using it for the past week, and it is by far one of the best cases I have used on any phone I've owned.Reasons why I'm giving this 5 Stars:- Fit and cutouts are perfect.- Excellent protection- Great outer shell that has that soft touch grip feel- Doesn't add a great deal of bulk, perfect combination of max protection & slimness- Bezel is flush, provides good lip for screen down placement, and fits perfectly around the touch screen- No issues with screen protector lift and case.- BUTTON FEEDBACK IS EXCELLENT.

As described, it consists of two layers, a softer inside portion that you put on first, followed by the hard outer shell which goes completely over the softer portion and snaps into place.  Covers that are either just the softer sort or just the harder sort aren't going to provide the same protection.  This case will take quite a fall -- each portion will absorb impact differently and should leave an undamaged device.  It also fits so well that the device isn't going to pop out . With my last phone, one unfortunate drop while walking led to a corner and partial edge popping out of that soft cover getting scraped up.  I was VERY lucky it landed then on the back rather than on its face where the glass would have also taken a beating.This case is designed well and fits precisely with all cutouts lining up flawlessly.  Application was very easy.  The buttons work very well, are easy to find through the cover (which has distinct shapes for them), and give ample feedback.Finally, this cover does work with my wireless Qi charger.The price is fantastic for a cover of this quality.  Highly recommended.  I only wish it had been offered BY Amazon so that I could have gotten prime shipping, but even without, I'd get the same cover again.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00B4I2GJU" id="B00B4I2GJU-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-03:</strong> Since Otterbox and Lifeproof don't make their cases for the Google LG Nexus 4, my choices are definitely limited.  I usually like the premium cases but don't have a choice.I bought the black case first and have enjoyed it.  One issue had to do with a crack on the outer shell of the case (less than 2-3 weeks old).  I am unsure what happened?  The case still works though.I decided to buy the red version and this is extremely cool!  The red is candy apple meets slightly metallic.  I don't know how to explain it but the finish is very nice.  I like the red case better since it makes the phone more visible in a purse, etc.  The black definitely got lost in the fray.I am hoping this red outer shell won't crack.

It also feels and looks less bulky. The edges of the case are more solidly built as the hard plastic comes a lot closer to the edges of the phone, preventing the &#34;lip&#34; on the soft silicone to flip up when taking it out of your pocket. It also does not push on the screen protector(dry application).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00B4I2GJU" id="B00B4I2GJU-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-03:</strong> I have to give this case five stars for keeping my nexus 5 blemish- (much less crack-) free from three falls at about waist height. None were hard, but one hit the corner and had me scared. Definitely protects well.The case has two layers: a rubbery inner layer with an outer hard-plastic shell that covers the entire back and most of the edges. This design isn't perfect: on the bottom where the speakers are located, there is no hard plastic lip. This means that the rubber inner liner can easily be pulled away from the edge of the phone. Under normal circumstances this isn't a problem. Further, I did a lot of research on the options available on Amazon back when I bought this, and most of the other cases had what seemed to be worse deficiencies around this part of the phone.As far as long-term durability, the bottom lip might eventually cause issues since larger usb charger plugs cause the rubber layer to flex upward. 4 months in, there isn't yet any evidence that it is being stretched out, but we'll see.The fit to the phone is great and it doesn't add much bulk at all.I'd give this a four star rating due to the bottom lip design &#34;flaw,&#34; but the thing flat out protects from my experience. Doing this at a bulk-level that is unnoticeable to me at this point means I had to give it all five stars.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00B4I2GJU" id="B00B4I2GJU-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-25:</strong> The white case turned blue-ish from my jeans on the first day and it only got worse from there. None of these are new jeans, all are more than a year old, so they've been washed several times. I recommend sticking to the black version.And this case keeps my Qi-enabled wireless charger from working effectively. It still seems to charge, but it is slow and the Superleggera case gets really hot.That said, it provides excellent protection. So when I travel, I switch to this case since I want a little more protection and my inductive charger stays at home.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00B4I2GJU" id="B00B4I2GJU-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-18:</strong> After reading and watching videos about how fragile the Nexus 4 was. Granted, I think that some people were just trying to scam LG into giving them a new phone, but I'm sure many were legit.  This prompted me to buy a dual layer case, similar to the Otterbox design which protects with a rubbery silicon layer in between the phone and the hard case.  Acase's Superleggera Pro Hybrid seemed to be the only one at the time that did not appear to bulky or visually loud, something that I needed for a more professional environment.So, I finally dropped it, then again, then again, which was no surprised considering how often I use my smart phone.  No cracked glass on either front or back and on relatively hard surfaces.  I'm not saying that it offers enough protection to survive a fall from a 3 story building, but it definitely took the minor falls that I gave it.For the protection it offers, the price was lower than one would expect.  Similar cases manufactured by otterbox are easily 20 to 30 dollars more. I definitely recommend this for any Nexus 4 owner.  Just buy it, you won't regret it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00B4I2GJU" id="B00B4I2GJU-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-11:</strong> I have had hybrid cases on most all of my smart phones at one point or another. I'm not the type for the Otterboxes because I think they're a little too crazy or too large. I personally tend to use TPU cases, but I like the hybrid cases specifically for travel and for when my mom inherits said phone when something newer and shinier comes out.I don't know if it's because the Nexus 4 feel decidedly more solid than my Samsung phones, or if it's because this hybrid case exposes very little of the rubber, but the Nexus 4 in this case feels VERY solid. I like that. I don't have the testicular fortitude to do a test drop from more than a centimeter or two, but I suspect this case would do as good a job as any of my Seidio cases in protecting the phone on a more involved drop.I'm curious to see if the rubber gets loose over time. I'm concerned that it was just tight initially and that time will leave it loose. However given just how much is covered by the shell, I can't imagine it'll be a problem.It also looks damn good as a case. I always felt my phone needed more color, and the finish on this is really nice. To be clear, I bought the white case because I've wanted a white phone for a while. And, as luck would have it, that was the cheapest option :-)For the money, it's a fantastic case.

But it does not affect the performance at all and leaving this behind I am pleased with the product and still a loyal customer.Protect the phone very well and does not add much bulk. One thing I didn't know when bought the case is that did not bring a screen protector unlike the first one I bought.

What is worse is every time I pulled my phone out of it, it left smudges on my screen! At first I thought they were scratches, but they did were not as they did wipe off. I would not recommend getting this case. With a phone as large as the HTC Inspire, I would recommend getting a clip holster. Mine works really well and I even forget that I have it on me.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004NRAYVQ" id="B004NRAYVQ-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-06-04:</strong> This is a good case if you want to carry your HTC Inspire (or Desire) on your belt but don't want to pay $20-$25 or more for a vertical belt case at a retail outlet. In addition, this case does have a bit of an "executive" pouch look as opposed to the techno-geek look of many belt cases, especially those made of plastic or other smooth synthetic materials. Another advantage of this case is that the phone fits smoothly; it's got enough room to allow it to slide easily in and out. I actually am able to use this while keeping a thin gel case on the phone. It doesn't slide in and out as easily now, but the leather had enough "give" to accommodate this. This gives me some protection all the time, and double the protection when the phone is in this case.Nonetheless, this case isn't perfect. It may be leather, but if it is, it is of the thinnest, lowest quality leather available. Basically, a very thin leather stitched to cardboard or plastic, I'm guessing. It's somewhat comical to call it "premium," as it is definitely not. It does look reasonably good, and I found that a bit of leather conditioning lotion gave it a deeper tone and made it look even better. Mine did not have the embossed logo and company name on the inside flap, a misrepresentation of what is shown in the photograph. In person, while it looks decent, it doesn't look quite as nice as the picture suggests. Finally, the belt clip does rotate, but not very easily. The clip itself is also not a spring type that opens and closes; it is a simple clip that can take a bit of effort to get over a thick belt.Overall, I recommend this case if you get it with the free shipping, since cases for the big HTC Inspire aren't too common, and this one is a third of the price of similar cases at retail stores like Office Depot and Best Buy. But keep in mind that it isn't really a "premium" case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004NRAYVQ" id="B004NRAYVQ-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-06:</strong> It worked perfectly for several weeks until the belt holder broke off.

All in all though the case did turn out to work for me so its not a great loss.  I have a SGSII with a case-mate tough case on it and I still wanted added protection in my pocket so i needed a case that would be large enough to accommodate the extra bulk.  Though this case was not perfect out of the box, a few modifications later I was well happy with it.  I carried it to the leather repair place in town and had them removed the belt clip and also the flap of the case was too short when I placed the phone in it and thus I had to have them readjust the internal magnet to allow for more vertical space for the phone.  All this being said I have yet to mention the quality of the case.  The leather is not the best in the world, it does seem a little cheap but it does hold up well under pressure thus far and trust me I put this pouch under a lot of pressure.  The magnet does hold the case closed firmly and it does seem like a good buy, won't really recommend it especially through the distributor mentioned above, but do buy it if your looking for a larger than usual case and will be satisfied to make the necessary modifications.The last thing is that I didn't receive any free gift with the order which allows me to believe the retailer is a tad bit shoddy, so again BUYER BE WARNED!!!!!!!!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004NRAYVQ" id="B004NRAYVQ-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-16:</strong> I give it 5 stars because it really is a quality product, but would not buy for being too big for my taste.

Same voltage but higher current rating than the battery which came with the phone (780mAh). Yes, I can get the battery door closed.First charge cycle: battery didn't seem to last as long as expected. Second charge cycle: much better. By the third charge cycle, I'm anticipating it outperforming the battery it replaced. I'm just making sure for the first few charges, it gets a chance to completely drain before I'm re-charging it.Update: I'm finding the battery doesn't really last much longer than the one it replaces. If I take a few calls, the battery life falls off pretty quickly. I do have a MicroSD card installed in the phone which is about 1/3rd full of personal music. I didn't think the SD card would take much power to retain it's contents. Oh well...

I don't see how the over all functioning can be improved upon. The only obvious shortcoming is with the materials it's made of. As is it should retail for $50. or better yet use polycarbonate and gorilla glass, not low quality painted plastic.It would seem there is a huge untapped market for this kind of phone so maybe this is only the beginning. It might need to be simplified even further for the elderly but for those like myself who are just burned out on the endless complexity of technology this is sweet.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005CWSF3U" id="B005CWSF3U-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-12:</strong> I bought my 83 yo mother the unlocked GSM Snapfon ezONE-C Senior Cell Phone with Big Buttons for about $80 (it's $60 now) along with its car charger (forgetting she doesn't drive any more!). I then carried it to her home in Montreal and activated on a Roger's 40 cent/min (but 0$/day) PayGo plan.My mother likes her Mac Mini and iPad, but she's largely blind, quite arthritic, and has peripheral neuropathy reducing her sense of touch. So most phones won't work for her. This was the only phone we could find that she might be able to use. She needs, for example, to be able to call for help when Montreal's sometimes unreliable wheelchair transport service fails to show up - leaving her stuck in her wheelchair as snow swirls, water freezes, and hungry wolves approach over the ice.It is impressive how few devices are made for people like my mother.  I assume the demand isn't there. Certainly if she were younger she might do well with a VoiceOver iPhone, but the combination of age and diminished touch make VoiceOver hard for her. In any case that was my best guess, but the next best choice to this $60 phone is probably a $700 iPhone 5.Based on limited use, here are my impressions of the device. I'll start with the bad, then the good. Bottom line: I think it will work, but I'd rather buy a better version for $100 than the current phone for $60.THE BAD- It doesn't get its time settings off the mobile network. Very weird.- I fear it doesn't  persistently store its configuration. I don't want to test this, but I think prolonged removal of the battery will wipe all setup - and setup is a bit painful. File this under "suspicion" not proven. Settings do survive a quick battery swap. (Maybe it's storing some data on the SIM card, in which case I might have been confused by a SIM swap.)- This is a very Chinese product -- feels like it was built for the Chinese or Japanese market. That is, it has a number of weird add-on features like an FM radio and a flashlight that mostly add complexity and seem weird for the US market. On the other hand, I think my mother might actually use the FM radio. It uses the ear set as an antenna. In my testing it worked well with an iPhone ear set and with iPod ear buds despite the manual saying only Nokia and SNAPFON earphones work.)- It has too many features that can simply cause confusion and will never be used, like 'conference call' and 'call waiting'. Even SMS is of dubious value. The radio introduces many options.- The power connector is small and hard for my mother to find. I stuck a rubber matt near it so she could find it. It is easily confused with the headphone jack.- It feels fragile and unreliable. We're not talking iPhone 5 build. I'd happily pay $40 more for better build quality.- Display is small and text layout is a bit off. I suspect it was designed to show characters, not Roman letters.- Buttons take some push -- they are cheap!- It comes with "PureTalk"; it's probably not the best PayGo solution but it's not entirely bad. For the US market I'd suggest H2O Wireless instead.THE GOOD-Big buttons!-Ringer is LOUD, and phone is loud and audible even at an intermediate setting.-The instruction manual is large type.-I could get a camera lanyard into the lanyard hoop with a bit of fiddling (essential accessory, should be bundled with phone).- It speaks numbers as they are entered. Great feature!- Seems to have very long battery life.- The quick dial numbers will work well I think, even though we decided not to enable the SOS feature for now.- Yes, the flashlight and radio are quirky, but my mother might actually come to like them.I created a large print 1 page handout for my mother that included a simplified version of usage directions and the numbers I programmed in for her.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005CWSF3U" id="B005CWSF3U-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-18:</strong> I bought this phone for my mother in law who is in a nursing home and due to ongoing repairs we cannot talk to her, so we decided to send a cell phone.This phone is just wonderful, it is simple, big buttons,very, but  very light which is very important with people with arthritis, and best of all , the volume, the ringer is really loud.So easily heard by people hard of hearing.It sends text messages, meaning it does everything any cell phone does, but better.Very easy to use.

You get three home buttons. One black, one red and one silver. Easy to apply. Lots of instructions. Makes home button easier to press and slightly more elevated. Looks great too. Much better than the free plastic ones that come with the spigen cases. This home button in my opinion is must if you have glass screen protector installed. Once I installed my glass screen protector I found the home button much more recessed and I needed something to elevate the home button. If I hadnt got the glass screen protector I probably wouldn't have need this home button as much. Im giving this product 4 stars I think $10 is high for just 3 home buttons. With the shipping and taxes the price does get higher than $10. If 6 home buttons were included 2 of each color. Or If you could maybe get the choice of color and just get 3 or more of that one color, that would be ideal. Great product from spigen wish I got earlier when I first got my s4, so I could get more use out of it. Will probably one have my s4 for another 3-6 months.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009WTGZIQ" id="B009WTGZIQ-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-15:</strong> Actually I bought this product by mistake.

If you purchase that from Spaigen as well you will realize they give you 6 plastic home buttons that do not look or feel great in my opinion.  Purchasing a $25+ glass screen protector is a luxury item and pretty much top of the line as screen protectors go then to combine that with a plastic home button is less then ideal.  These aluminum home buttons are wonderful and come in a small package that contains 3 (pink, silver, and black).  There was nothing else in the packaging but I immediately put on the black home button easy to install.  It feels and looks great with the Glass screen protectors.  If you purchase their glass screen protectors I highly recommend purchasing these home buttons as this is what should have came with your luxury screen protector.  Price is a little high for 3 buttons but for my case I used the black and just resold the other two for $6 and recouped some change.I would give this 4 1/2 stars if possible as I feel they are pricing their customers for something that should come with the glass screen protectors but the product itself is 5 stars.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009WTGZIQ" id="B009WTGZIQ-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-06:</strong> These are nice to look at.

I like the look and feel of these very much.  I applied it too my phone with ease and even peeled it up with ease and there was no detectible loss of stikiness (as in the button falling off) after doing that.  So it would appear as though these would be reusable a few times.  I would think that they would loose there adhesive after a while with wear and tear but so long as you are not into taking it off every day this wouldn't be a problem.  The reason I docked a star is that I feel 10 dollars is rather steep for these.  Yes I paid it hence this review but I still feel these could be a few dollars cheaper (5 or 6 maybe.)  If you think 10 is acceptable to pay and you have the SPIGEN glass get these.

I rock an iPhone 5 white with a moonshine white Knucklecase (from their site, not the fakes here) and the silver button. Let me tell you this: Some people do really think I have a 5s for some reason. I just tell them its an attachable button, not a transplant, and people look at me sheepishly drooling hahaa!Ladies and gentlemen, if you have an iPhone 4/4s/5/5c this will make your phone hot! I gave the other two to my cousins both rocking Black Slate 5's and the red really sticks out! The gunmetal button is mehh unless you are going full on ballistic black. Installation took about 3 minutes for me and I actually used tweezers to put it on without it being crooked otherwise I will go into OCD beast mode and scrap it! Get this and you'll automatically be a headturner at a club, social group, school, you figure it out.NOTE: CLEAN YOUR PHONE BEFORE STICKING THIS ON OTHERWISE SKIN OILS AND OTHER DIRT CAN MAKE THE ADHESIVE WEAR OUT PRETTY SOON!

And what a fantastic combination these two items are. The GLAS.tR is perhaps the finest phone shield much in the vein of the superb Giotto's glass LCD guards for dSLRs. However, it does leave the home button pretty well sunk in, a situation which prevents accidental activation but that some find objectionable. The Button solves this issue nicely. Very easy to apply with the "Scotch tape" method. Easy to reapply if you miss slightly the first time. The milled grooves are precise and the chamfered edge was precisely machined. All was well in terms of fit and finish although some have found issues with the centering of the grooves, inset square shape, or the chamfer. When properly applied, it sits just a hair's thickness below the surface of the GLAS.tR. The feel is sure and comfortable to the finger and button activation is not negatively affected at all. You just have to make sure that 1) the GLAS.tR is centered and that the Button is centered in the opening for the home button. I'm quite happy with this unit. The only concern I'll be watching out for over time is accumulation of crud in the gap between the screen protector and the button. I suspect if it gets sufficiently grubby that I'll have to pull the Button and install another. That's okay as they give you three in the $10 pack.I have to say that with the Button, the GLAS.tR, and the Minisuit low profile case, I am as happy with the aesthetics of my iPhone system as I am with the functionality. Beautiful.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009WTGZIQ" id="B009WTGZIQ-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-21:</strong> These home button stickers, I'd imagine, are meant to be used with Spigen's Glas.t and Glas.tR products. However, for the Galaxy S4, they aren't really needed. The home button on the phone naturally sticks out a bit, and with the screen protector on, it's still not too difficult to press it.But I will say this: The Aluminum Home Button Stickers look a TON better than the cheap jelly ones that come with the screen protectors. They're smooth to the touch and and look incredibly sharp. All of them are cut perfectly to fit in the home button cut out on the Glas. products and they give a naturally cheap feeling phone a more sophisticated look.Application was pretty easy with my Glas.tR already on, and the adhesive feels pretty strong.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009WTGZIQ" id="B009WTGZIQ-review21" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-05:</strong> I love these buttons and they definitely are stylish and makes my phone sleek and chic!

Replacing the jelly home buttons that spigen provided with the glas.t, it feels extremely good. It comes level with the glas.t in instead of sticking up like the jelly ones. Also, the genuine aluminum feels great and not cheap at all and the tactile feedback is great. It definitely adds a beautiful pop to the front of my phone without being tacky. I highly recommend this for anyone who is first of all looking for an alternative home button to use with the glas.t or glas.tr as well as anyone who simply wants to dress up their phone elegantly. I also have the black one on my black iPad and it's equally stunning. It does rise up a bit but nothing drastic.As for installation, I recommend using a piece of tape to pick up the button, align it and apply it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009WTGZIQ" id="B009WTGZIQ-review23" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-17:</strong> I've bought a lot of Spigen's products and I've been very pleased with all of them.

The button covers are too thick to use with an iPad cover. For iPhone, it is also to thick. The button accidentally triggers devices to wake causing battery to drain over a period of time. In other words it it to thick.I think the design and  colors are excellent. Other than that, like I said above, they are made to thick. Should have been made thin as a screen protector cover or at least close. Scratch that idea, in fact, the adhesive under the button cover is a bit thick now that I think about it.

Phone looks excellent and trust me, no one will think theres an aftermarket case or button on your phone, it all looks stock and clean.  The button on my Note 2 is a little raised, but the buttons on the GS4 are not.  This solves that.  And though the button is going to make your home button stick out a little bit (not flush, but IMO still looks great and is probably prefferable) it is the same height as the lip on the Neo Hybrid, which again makes it look like this is how the phone came.As usual, Spigen rocks.  Though their products might be more expensive than the low end stuff people for some reason are willing to use on their high end phones, I have to say that their products always impress with their quality, clean appearance, and superiority over most anything else on the market.  Now debating ordering the same for my Note 2.Only complaint is that you have to get stuck with 2 buttons you dont want just to get one you do.

It's because the button protrudes of course so it's to be expected.  I just have to take it out of the holster before I get in the car.

It's a colored metallic button with an adhesive back that goes over your home button! Not much to it, but I will say the quality behind it is A+You can't go wrong with it. If there's any negative reviews then I'm chalking it up to operator error. No way is the product crappy in any way! So why didn't I give it a perfect score for a perfect product?Well I have a design gripe that doesn't effect the quality of the product in anyway shape or form, but stylistically I don't like the &#34;convex&#34; look of the button. It's a minor gripe, kind of like when you find that perfect person and then they have that thing that bothers you. You still love it/them and can easily look over it, but you notice it from time to time.This convex look makes the button look like it's not flush with the Spigen Tempered glass screen protector. At a glance, it appears as if the button is raised. This raised look to me makes it look less OEM. I don't know if a concave look will fix that, but I feel like it's a safe assumption.What I hope for future Spigen releases is a concave metal button to make the phone look like a special OEM phone</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009WTGZIQ" id="B009WTGZIQ-review54" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-15:</strong> These feel nice, but honestly make the phone look kind of weird.

It should reach Amazon's 'Best Seller' mark in the division of External Batteries.  I've gone through 6 other units.  This is the best one.  I've been charging my Note 3 when it's down to about 20% battery THREE Times to 100% before having to recharge my Simplicity 7800mAh.  I wanted to give it a good long run for it's money before posting a review.I'll never buy a standard sized 2700mAH, or 3100mAH unit again.  This unit is way more functional, doesn't seem much bulkier, & has a smooth color/ sleek shape.  It is an ample amount of power/ saves time.. no need to charge it constantly like smaller mAH units.  It stays fully charged for a long time if left unused.  It had all four bars after 10 days of not using it.Besides that, it works flawlessly.  Plus, it has gorgeous mini white LED's to show it's status.  I keep this in my Car's console and charge my phone some nights when my Car is off (I sleep better without a phone in the house).Another GREAT thing about this unit is the Cord!  It has a built in Cord that stores unto itself.

Because I have a lightening cord apple product I need to use my own cord with this device, which is no problem for me because I prefer to use apple only cords. This unit is very sleek and &#34;hip&#34; in appearance. I think it would satisfy any gear lover or tech freak. I like the built in power cords so I can easily attach it to my computer for recharge.I was able to charge my phone 4 times with this charger ( It is important to note here that I am charging from 20%, not from any red zone power area- if I were to be charging from the red zone I would get less than 4 charges. I would guess 3 because an apple product takes much more energy to charge from red than it does from green). I then plugged into my computer and the unit recharged itself in about 2.5 hours. It does have a built in no overcharge feature so I would really recommend just plugging this in at night.The unit it extremely portable with barely any added weight when thrown into a work bag or backpack.I highly recommend this unit that I was gifted in exchange for an honest review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JTDAXDI" id="B00JTDAXDI-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-08:</strong> I own two other external batteries that I've used for a couple of years, and both have their drawbacks (take a long time to re-charge, capacity is limited, etc.).  This unit seems to solve all those problems for me.I used this with my iPhone 5S (lightning) and a Photive CYREN Portable Bluetooth Speaker (micro-USB)First, it's easy to recharge the Simplicity using either your computer (I used my MacBook Pro) or a USB wall charger.  The wrap-around cable detaches easily and plugs right into the USB port; the micro-USB plugs right into the Simplicity battery unit.  I plug it in at night, and it's fully charged ready to go by morning.Once charged, it will work with any device that uses a micro-USB cable (using the included cable), OR your own lightning cable for iPhone.The recharge rate for the iPhone is VERY fast -- much better than I expected.  And I was able to charge my phone 4 times before running out of juice from the Simplicity unit.For the speaker, I was able to get 3 full charges before the Simplicity needed to be recharged.  The speaker has a large battery capacity (will run the speaker for 8-10 hours), so I feel that getting 3 full charges is excellent performance.Then there's the design -- sleek, stylish, minimal.  The gray cable wraps around the unit securely, and the entire effect is chic and classy.  Its small size makes it highly portable -- I can slip it into my purse or overnight bag, and although it has a bit of weight to it (it is, after all, a battery), it's not bad at all.This is a high quality well-performing external battery.  Definitely recommended!

Its large 7800mAh capacity will fully charge an iPhone several times.I charged a Kindle Fire HD (1st gen) & a Fire HDX when they  both had about 50% power left. The Simplicity charged them both to 100% & had power left.It has a 90% conversion rate which means the Simplicity @ 7800mAh, 90% conversion, will provide more charges than a 7800mAh with a 70 - 80% conversion. (You will receive closer to the 7800mAh charging capacity. I hope that makes sense, it's hard for me to explain)One time, my Fire HDX was at 14% - in an 1h 20m, the Simplicity had the HDX battery charged to  62%...that was fast! The Simplicity's output is 2.1A.Fully charge before first use.To check for battery life,  press the power button, the 4 LED lights  will indicate the remaining battery level in the portable charger. It will need to be recharged if no LEDs are lit. I usually recharge it when only one LED lights up.Charge the Simplicity by plugging the micro USB into the Simplicity & the USB into your laptop or AC USB Wall Charger (recommended for faster charging).When the Simplicity is charging, the LED light/s will start blinking. When it is full, all four lights will appear solid.When the Simplicity was depleted & needed to be recharged, it took about 7 - 7 1/2 hours to fully charge it using an AC wall charger.I absolutely love the wrap around micro USB cable. It is so convenient & doesn't come off in my purse.If you use the Simplicity with an Apple product or a product that doesn't use a micro USB, you will need to supply your own cable.Safety Features: The intelligent circuit prevents the battery from self-charging when the micro USB is plugged into both ports. Automatic temperature control to protect the battery against electrical hazards to protect the phone's battery.Lepow thinks of everything, they even use direct color injection molding (reduces the spraying process) which is more eco friendly. And, the Simplicity's  ergonomic design fits my hand perfectly; it is very comfortable to hold.Measurements & Weight (approximate):7.1oz7 1/4" long x 2" - 2 1/4" at widest point x 1" thick5 stars, if my opinion changes, I'll update my review.In the next few days, I'll upload a video showing the Simplicity at work.review sample provided</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00JTDAXDI', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00JTDAXDI', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B009R68J6K</h2>    <p class="price"> $B009R68J6K</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009R68J6K" id="B009R68J6K-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-25:</strong> These are awesome for the times when you do not want to put your stylus in the hole.

Fits the S3 perfectly, even with a slim case.Cons: The armband is tight on bigger guys.  Doesn't stretch so not great for weights.I really like the armband.  I have a case and screen protector on the phone, and the phone fits in the armband great.  The screen is responsive while in the case, even with the protector.  It also doesn't slip even while sweating during the workout.  However, there is one drawback to the case if you want to use it for weightlifting.  It is tight and doesn't stretch if you are a pretty big guy.  I'm 6'1" and 215 and the band is very tight while running, which is great.  But it isn't good when lifting weights, because the band doesn't stretch.  This caused the band to rip during a weightlifting session.  I'll get another one for running but I'll have to get another solution for weightlifting.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008CNHNJ8" id="B008CNHNJ8-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-23:</strong> Product LOOKS great.

Your phone slides in and you can use it while you run.Cons:-It's extremely difficult to get the phone out afterwards. The tiny bit of moisture that makes it's way into the case is enough to make the phone feel like it's glued to the inside.-It's very difficult to adjust the volume when the case is on.-The screen is very unresponsive through the clear plastic front. On top of that, there is a lot of glare when outside, so it's even more difficult to see the screen.-Tighten the arm band slowly, or it will pinch your upper arm.With all that said, I'd still recommend the product for the price. It works, and I don't feel like it's about to fall apart on me.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008CNHNJ8" id="B008CNHNJ8-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-28:</strong> This is everything I needed from an armband to hold my cell phone.

I like the look and feel of the fabric-like back.  It offers easy access to all features (buttons, camera lenses, etc...) and the case is small enough that the phone doesn't feel bulky in my hand yet still feels securely held when in use.  I love the size but it also could be a negative for some users since it's not the most robust case on the market.  If you're looking for a very sturdy case that provides maximum protection I'd suggest an Otterbox Defender case instead.  But be ready to accept more bulk for that added protection. If you don't want the added bulk this one is a good option for you.  (Note: the Defender has the added feature of a built-in screen protector. I've always added a screen protector to my phones but I opted against doing so on my 7&#34; table that has Gorilla Glass and I've had no scratches at all.  I'm not using one on my S5 either so a screen protector is not a feature I miss. I'm just mentioning this for those worried about scratch protection.)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JMPXM5E" id="B00JMPXM5E-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-10:</strong> The short of this review is that this case is nice and thin. Comfortable to hold and protects quite well. Also, it's not rubber, but something harder (and not too stiff). So those are all the good points. The only bad point is that I've had it for only a few weeks and some of the threads on the back are starting to come out. But it's not big a complaint.For those interested, I went on a quest for the ideal case ever since I switched from my Samsung Galaxy S2 to the S5. Quite a difference in size. And it's this big size of the S5 that starts the problem of being able to find just the right case. Here's what I went through:1) I started with the Otterbox Defender case which has a lot of good reviews. And for good reason. Because if you ignore the bulkiness of that case, it's fantastic. Comfortable (although a little too wide for my hands) with excellent protection (I think you could throw it on a rock and it wouldn't scratch!). But I couldn't ignore the added size of that case. So I returned it.2) Next I got the flip case (folio). Very sleek and professional looking. However you need both your hands - one to flip the case open and the other to actually use on the phone. I found it hard to use if I was driving (which I agree is not a safe thing to do anyway) or if I was walking my dog with one hand on the leash (again, not a good thing to take a phone when out on a walk!). But I think you can appreciate that there are times when you have only one hand free, and if you need to use the phone at those times, the flip case makes it difficult. So I returned that as well.3) Finally I got this Case Logic cover. The price was also right! But most of all, it was thin, comfortable to hold in my hand and provided enough protection.There are a few other nice and thin covers, and perhaps a little more sleek looking. But I got tired of hunting around. I'm staying with this Case Logic case!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JMPXM5E" id="B00JMPXM5E-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-30:</strong> Great case, although it doesn't offer as much protection as I'd hoped.

With blue/gray fabric backing, it looks great on my husband's S5 and I trust the case to protect it from the typical bumps and bangs his phone generally endures.  Overall I am satisfied this case will protect our investment while not adding any significant weight or dimension, which is vital for someone with hand dexterity issues.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JMPXM5E" id="B00JMPXM5E-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-02:</strong> The Case Logic CLS5-104 for my Samsung Galaxy S5 is a phone cover that is a little more different that other covers.  It's not as heavy or protective Otterbox Commuter I have on my HTC One  M8, but is is a hard shell style cover.  It comes with no screen protector.  This is a different design because it has a sheet of finely woven fabric which feels like treated polyester laminated to the hard plastic rear of the cover.  It's close to perfect on the one I received, and hasn't been applied off grain which would drive me nuts.  In the blue/grey model, the blue is a dark as blue can be, nearly black, and the grey fabric is an attractive monochromatic accent.  The plastic molded case is lightweight and snaps onto the phone very easily, then snaps off if you want to change it for another.  There is no protection over any of the parts of the camera which you want accessible.  Nothing to move or remove for using the camera, speaker, charger (other than the phone's existing tab), button, or fingerprint scanner.  This doesn't afford an incredible amount of protection should you drop the phone, but it is an extra layer and I like the camera being flush now.  I hope it holds up to daily use.EDIT 7/12/14... To my dissappointment, a corner of the case now has a white spot peeking through the dark blue.  It has not been dropped or knocked,  so I am not optimistic about the longevity of the case.Reducing star rating from 5 to 4 for now.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JMPXM5E" id="B00JMPXM5E-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-29:</strong> I like this case.  It is not super bulky & it looks &#34;good&#34;.  It doesn't give a lot of protection so if you have kids using your phone or tend to have butter fingers, you may need more than this.  But it does protect the corners & provide light bump protection.  The fabric could get grubby over time but it's a nice look.  All the buttons & ports are easily accessible.  It snaps on & off fairly easily but stays on & in place even going in/out of my purse & briefcase.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JMPXM5E" id="B00JMPXM5E-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-30:</strong> I have an Otterbox Commuter case for my GS5 already, but I wanted to see what a smaller case would be like.  This offering from Case Logic seemed like an interesting choice, as it is almost the polar opposite of the Otterbox.  My instinct was correct, but I am sticking with the Otterbox.  This case doesn&#8217;t have a lot to offer in terms of additional protection, and it barely covers the corners - a corner strike is you should be worried about.  All controls are accessible, and it does protect the back of the phone from scratches and dings.  However, it really seems to be about form over function.  Unless you just really like the look of this case (which it is not bad), I would not recommend this case.  It just doesn&#8217;t offer up enough protection.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00JMPXM5E', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00JMPXM5E', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B005FKT0NI</h2>    <p class="price"> $B005FKT0NI</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FKT0NI" id="B005FKT0NI-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-22:</strong> I love this case!

One of them runs out fairly quickly, but I'm not sure if that's because of the wear and tear I put on them, but either way, I was only looking for 2 extra batteries anyway. Cannot beat the price. Only complaint is that the charger is designed for the standard 2100mAh batteries (like the factory one) and not the 2300mAh batteries that come with this. Because of that, these batteries only charge to about 95% on the wall charger and the factory one will charge to 100% - this is based upon the &#34;charge-off&#34; feature in the wall charger (so you won't overcharge the batteries).

I love this because overkill is always good if you depend on something the way most of us do our cell phones.  On a practical level by rotating all three cells with the original Samsung one I believe I will get more total days out of each battery.  Why?  I don't know...But, there is something about moderate versus overuse, draining too much versus 80% drainage, and actual rest (not too much however) between discharge/charge cycles.  So, if you buy into all, or even part of this, you'll love having three extra batteries.These are very slightly marginally thicker than the Samsung original cell and I'm happy to say they fit just the same.  No problem whatsoever.  They may last 30 minutes longer which anything is appreciated, but I wouldn't say the slight extra time they give is the reason you should choose these as it's more like a little bonus icing on your cake.As for the charger wall-plug brick itself.  It ain't nothing fancy in quality or design.  It does get the job done and is portable without the spaghetti wire effect.  No overheating of cells as far as I can tell and I've had it over a year and should know.  It isn't a super fast charging model yet does get the job done in 5 or less hours typically when dealing with an up to 90% discharged cell.  I like the bright indicator as I can see if it's ready from a good distance.Overall, a fine affordable battery/charger solution.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0088VUXTQ" id="B0088VUXTQ-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-04:</strong> Great charge and battery, its a must when your on the go with days without charging.

It takes 12 hours to fully charge the batteries and that is in the phone.  They never reach 100% charge in the worthless battery charger.  Who has 12 hours to charge a battery?  On top of that, once fully charged, the battery will still be dead in about 6 to 8 hours.  You don't even get a full day of use and I don't use my phone constantly like some people.  I bought these to go on vacation and have plenty of battery while I was out and hopefully not have to charge my battery daily. Did not work out that way at all.  I used my original battery and just recharged it at night since these batteries take way too long to charge, the charger doesn't even work and then the batteries drain in no time.  And to make it all worse, I have to pay the return shipping for these worthless batteries and charger.

Samsung wanted to keep my phone for 2 weeks to fix it. Truth be told the piece that connects the charge port is very thinly placed on the motherboard and will eventually go out on most phones. I have only had the galaxy for 4 months and it went out. Insurance on it will cost you $150 to replace the entire device. I decided to get this instead of replacing the entire phone. It works great but the batteries never charge to 100% like your original Samsung battery will. They only go to around 96% but now I am never with a dead phone. It is somewhat an inconvenience to have to swap them all the time but its better than waiting for one to charge.

The replacement batteries only charge to about 87% but when your main battery dies and you are trying to capture priceless moments with your phones camera, 87% makes all the difference in the world! I carry the spare in my purse and use it for these kinds of moments.Also, be careful that you don't over charge because the plug in is supposed to change colors from pink to blue (i think) but it doesn't always change. I'm guessing that if you have it plugged in for 45-1 hour, that is more than enough time.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0088VUXTQ" id="B0088VUXTQ-review29" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-17:</strong> I haven't used these much.

I binged the Internet to look at a roadmap and don't see any hope that Mac machines will be supported at all.The Nokia Software Updater and Maps Uploader apps for Mac do not recognize this phone at all despite successful OTA software update.  The Media syn app also doesn't recognize the phone and so I could't upload music to this device.It is a resistive screen and touch response for me is adequate.  It may be deemed slow or trash, but hey touch screen response is very subjective.  At times the screen would turn white for a second, usually when you slide out the keypad.I like the physical keyboard.  Battery is more than average.  The first full charge did not last a day despite the phone mostly on idle.  The second charge lasted 2 days with apps running.I like the free Ovi Maps the most.  This is probably the phone's best asset.I also like the Facebook ticker.  It seems to me that this is the "Facebook phone.".  Albeit, the typeface is small due to cramped screen.  Also, I never like the legacy Nokia font which existed since my Nokia 5110i.  The FB ticker shows random contacts.  Can't change that to your inner circles.I also like the feel of physical answer/hang-up buttons.  The phone is good quality plastic, the screen however cheap looking.This phone is the low-end ver of Nokia N97 Mini.I am bothered by Nokia's lack of support for US market bec software updates are apparently released first in EU and Asia for similar handset in the US.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003VNKLES" id="B003VNKLES-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-10-27:</strong> Buen producto,, todo excelente,, pero tenia un problema con el bot&oacute;n de c&aacute;mara, no funciono.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003VNKLES" id="B003VNKLES-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-09-12:</strong> 04/05/2012 UPDATE: I want to do a quick comparison between the Nokia C6-00 and Android phones, specifically Samsung Nexus S by Google. I've been using the Google android phone for the past 11 months and it did EVERYTHING I needed it to do from paying for Starbucks coffee using a Starbucks app so I didn't need to carry my Starbucks card around and accessing multiple MS Exchange accounts to the interface and OS being slick and nimble as well as Google directions/mapping/GPS; the MAJOR downside to smartphones such as Android and others is the fact that they are battery drainers because of the intense use of power for the OS and display especially. I could not last more than 6-8 hours on Android and this is with setting the Display to the lowest brightness at all times which is a pain when outdoors in bright sunlight. That was the ONLY issue with my Android. Anyway, it did everything I needed so I stuck with it. Until recently the sounds stopped working. So I sold it and now I am back with Nokia. The strength of Nokia is the battery lasts a good 14-15 hours on standby (not sure why this Amazon description states 16 days or so, no, 15 hours, so at the end of the day before going to bed, you need to charge it up again for the next day). I can only add ONE MS Exchange email account on Nokia and I also have Gmail installed. The OS is not as slick and fast as Android and there is a "white screen" lag, but you put up with it. The sounds, ringing, call quality and reliability of the Nokia as a PHONE first and foremost is second to none. The Android (Samsung) had low ringing volume even at maximum. Also Sprint service for the Android was weak in my area, so ATT under Nokia was better. The Nokia is a "workhorse" of a phone that is loud (volume, I like!) and does a barely ok job at being a 'smart phone.' I will keep using it for now because of long battery life and I can switch out the SIM card to my flip phone using the same data plan for traveling using a small flip phone, esp. overseas like Europe (ATT only charges $10 month for unlimited data since it is not considered a smart phone versus minimum $30 for smart phone). Will I eventually switch to a smart phone when something I like comes out, YES, of course, the Android experience (except for battery life) did EVERYTHING I needed a smartphone to do (rich apps for banking, Starbucks, etc) and my LIFESTYLE. What will I look for in a smart phone next time? STRONG BATTERY LIFE (EASILY LASTING 15 HOURS ON STANDBY OR BASICALLY WHAT I CALL A 'WHOLE DAY' BEFORE CHARGING AT NIGHT), LOUD RINGER AND VOLUME, 4G CAPABILITY, HANDLE MULTIPLE MS EXCHANGE EMAIL ACCOUNTS.06/20/2011 UPDATE: Bought this phone in September 2010. There is still a slight lag (in the form of a "white screen") in between applications but other than this and the slight heft (weight) to the phone, it is a good sized pull out keyboard phone. For a while the Ovi maps and Ovi store apps did not work, I finally figured out I needed to delete the old files from apps manager and redownload Ovi maps and Ovi store. The trick is it is a Catch 22, you cannot download Ovi maps with Ovi store (the PC sync did not work for me in the first place), and you cannot if Ovi store did not work, I finally went to the browser and searched download ovi store and did it that way and once I go Ovi store working, downloaded Ovi maps and then everything works now. The music was a trick, you need to sync to your PC and copy and paste to the C6 after created a "Music" folder, then in the C6 press music and then library and then "Options" and then refresh the list and then your copied and pasted music will show up, otherwise you will be figuring out why it does not show up after a while, you need to manually refresh the music library!I added somore more apps like a flashlight and games, etc. It is 100% working and a nice little phone. However, my main phone is a Samsung Nexus S 4G from Sprint because it is a PURE GOOGLE experience on android, it is faster and smoother, and because I rely on gmail and Google calendar and Google everything apps, it just works for me. This C6 is a travel phone for me, for example I also have a Motorola Ming A1200 flip phone I used in Europe and the C6 will also be a travel phone for me when I do not need to take my larger Nexus S 4G with me traveling. So the C6 is powered off, all set up, and stored away in my closet until my next travel trip (the last time I took it I went to Idaho and Oregon on business) because the battery life on the C6 lasts a whole day+, the flip phone Ming A1200 was even better, a few days battery. The Nexus S 4G I charge every night and can't beat the apps and user experience on nexus S.Recommendation is 3 stars now from 2 stars. I would recommended it but would advise of the heft and the white screen. Everything works on it though, but with MS Exchange you can only add one email address so I have a MS Exchange address and a Gmail address, which is basically what I need for email.11/1/2010 UPDATE: HAD THIS PHONE FOR A FEW WEEKS NOW, THE "WHITE SCREEN" BETWEEN SWITCHING SCREENS, ETC IS GETTING ANNOYING NOW, FOR $300+ OR SO I PAID FOR THIS PHONE I EXPECT A FASTER PROCESSOR. I AM CHANGING MY STARS FROM 4 TO 2; I WOULD NOT BUY THIS IF I KNEW HOW ANNOYINGLY THIS WHITE SCREEN WOULD BE.I am reviewing Nokia C6 here first since I had time to play with it, I will review the N900 soon in a bit under the N900 product site on Amazon (I reviewed the N900 on 10/13/10 so look for it under my "Kingmonkey" ID). The C6 . . . I couldn't decide between Nokia N900 and C6 (did not want new N8 coming out end of September 2010 since there was no physical keyboard), so I bought both N900 and C6. Phones do not come with a case to hold, which is a disappointment considering how much each phone costs. For some reason Nokia only sells OEM cases for these phones to the European market, if you go to Amazon UK site or Nokia EU site you will see cases made for N900 and C6, so I had to go to Amazon UK site to order an OEM case for N900; the C6 on Nokia EU site has some nice ones but could not find them on Amazon UK and on Nokia EU site I cannot order them online being from the USA as you need to go to a retail location in Europe. Anyway got some generic case (more like a pouch) for the C6 from Amazon UK.The C6 is a nice looking, stylish phone, good size phone, not too thick or long at all, it's fairly small and fits in your shirt pocket if you are a guy. Made of quality materials and feels like a quality product from the weight of the phone and also when you slide the keyboard out, it is stiff and not moving about. The top row keyboard key is a little close to the top half of the phone so when you type your thumb hits the top and gets in the way; not a deal breaker for me as I just learn to adapt. Those with bigger hands (fingers) may find the keyboard a little cramped but I wanted a smaller smart phone compared to the other ones out there such as Samsung Galaxy or Motorola Droid, so it is expected to be smaller overall as that is part of the appeal. Physically that was the only issue, again, Nokia is stylish, smart looking, and as always, love their Nokia ringtone theme. One last thing on the physical side, being a middle of the road phone (between N8 and lower end Nokia phones) it doe snot have al of the bells and whistles hence the lower price. One feature I wish it had, like the more higher end N900, is a camera lens cover, the camera is just exposed to dust, etc; the C6 does come with a factory "screen protector" and since this is a new phone and you can't buy a screen protector just yet I suggest leaving it on to protect the screen, since after I set up the C6, the screen protector is scratched from my use of the phone (normal use with fingers swiping back and forth, mind you, I take care of my nice things, gently putting it down, wrapping it in napkin until my pouch comes in the mail, wash my hands and dry them, no lotion, before I handled my phone), so even with all of this the screen still gets scratched slightly if you look at it at an angle. Anyway will need to buy a screen protector when they are available and hopefully the one that came with it will last.On the software side, the 2GB microsd chip only holds the California map and voice navigation (street names + male voice both for US as two separate files); that's about 2GB total. If you want all of US and other countries, need to buy a 16GB microsd but even with this not sure if it can hold all the maps as you will need to delete some still as some maps are several gigs(I think 16GB additional gigs is the limit the C6 can handle for a microsd card). I don't travel a lot outside of California so it does the job and don't need to buy a bigger sized microsd card for now, I can wait until I need it and by then the microsd card price will go down.The other major issue is I use Google calendar, right now you can use MS exchange to set up google mail, calendar and contacts but it imports ALL of my gmail contacts into my C6 even though I don't actively keep in touch with all of them, I suppose you can choose to update only calendar and gmail and skip the contacts, don't remember if this is an option. The calendar also only updates my main Calendar so others I created, including Holidays calendars, bill due date calendars, etc do NOT get imported. This was a deal breaker for me so I deleted this newly created/added gmail account and all of the contacts and email and calendar got deleted, which is what I wanted and it went back to how it was, being empty. By the way when you import this way, any contacts or information you had in the calendar gets overridden with the new import, so my one contact I created with a photo and all got overridden with the import. I had to reenter it. Anyway my workaround is to use instead of MS Exchange option on Nokia to add Google accounts like gmail and calendar, etc, I used the "Gmail" option via the email icon to set up the email account and it works well. As for Google calendar, there is a Google Mobile site and one bookmark webpage you can set up is for Google Calendar, so for my Internet application I set my default homepage as the Google calendar address so when I want to look at ALL (holidays, bills, color coded too) of my Google calendars I just open up that bookmarked web page homepage and it is there updated in real time by Google. As for the Ovi calendar, don't use it, maybe I'll look at it just to see what day it is every sooften. So I get my Google calendar but via a webpage site, not the Ovi calendar because like I said the MS Exchange way to sync gmail mail and calendar and contacts only gives you the main calendar, no other calendars created as discussed above.I also downloaded OVI software to my PC and the linking between the C6 and Ovi software on my PC works well, this is how you sync the photos, maps, contacts, etc from your PC to the C6, also faster way to update your C6 with software updates since you download them from the PC first and then link your C6 to the PC via a USB cable and the data transfer is faster. Otherwise you would have to do it over airwaves on the C6, which is slower even using 3G but you can connect to wifi if available using the C6.I customized my desktop icons, which is pretty cool, I added a couple rows of frequent contacts, then 3rd row from top Gmail, then a couple row of shortcuts below such as web access, a bookmarked web page, calc, camera, last row has messaging icon, then I downloaded an app for messaging, including google talk, from the Ovi app store by searching for "messaging"--it's called Nimbuzz and with this you choose your account type, Google talk, Yahoo messenger, whatever . . . at first I was lookign and looking for Google Talk app but it does not exist, you have to access Google talk through this 3rd party app Nimbuzz or something else equivalent (it was a free app) and it works perfectly fine. The C6 home screen icons,being Symbian software based, is a bit "cartoonish" when compared to more sophisticated phones like the N900 or Droid icons or Blackberry 9000 Bold, but it's fine and the learning curve is not steep to learn to master the C6 menu and navigation as discussed above.Overall I am happy with the Nokia, good size, small bar type smart phone, good looking, quality materials. The C6 is Symbian based and my N900 is Maemo based so another reason I bought both to compare and see how I like them. C6 works with ATT 3G so since I have an existing ATT SIM card it works great, the N900 I signed up for a T-Mobile individual plan text+web+voice and the N900 3G only works with TMobile 3G, So I am set here; if I used the ATT SIM card the ATT 3G does not work with Nokia N900 and would have to settle for EDGE (non 3G).

The articulation of the mount is beautiful and makes it easy to position and lock in place.  Suction cup works very well.  Make sure that the glass is not cold.  It stays put very nicely and can likely fit well in almost any vehicle due to the multiple areas it adjusts.  You can even have the phone mounted vertically if you would like that option.  It would be really cool if you could swap out the suction cup to a mount that clipped into the air vent to mount it of the glass, but works fine being mounted to the glass.  I would even consider buying another one since I have two vehicles.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00BCOHYNO', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00BCOHYNO', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B000QDPUBK</h2>    <p class="price"> $B000QDPUBK</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B000QDPUBK" id="B000QDPUBK-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-09:</strong> I just got it in the mail and I saw the reviews and figured &#34;I'll just reinforce the stitches with a needle and thread when it arrives.&#34; but an examination of it revealed that it's pretty durable.

I also used the included cable ties for added security as it is on a motorcycle as opposed to a bicycle, and thus far it has held up well.The included cable ties are OK but if you wish you can use sturdier ones, and then cut them to length after attaching, if you know you are going to keep the mount on one single bike that is.The case itself is certainly OK to use as an everyday case, and then simply plug and twist to the handlebar mount to secure when needed. I don't use mine often enough to warrant having the case on, and prefer a more protective case for everyday use.The Front cover clear "poncho" is a thick plastic push over cover, that allows for touch input and clear vision, but is designed for rain protection rather than a lot of touch screen usage, but that's fine as I just really want to put the phone there and leave it while I'm riding.The locking bracket that fits inside the back of the case with a reassuring "click" feels much more secure than it looks, and has been pretty sturdy so far.The case outer is thick, so access to external buttons is not that great, but like I said, I believe it's designed more to be a mount to be used like a GPS unit, rather than full phone function. I wouldn't recommend trying to text or type while riding anyway.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BN7XNQW" id="B00BN7XNQW-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-10:</strong> This mount works perfectly on the stem of my road bike.

It is extremely easy to mount the phone in either landscape or portrait mode.The case for the phone is decent but as one other reviewer mentioned it does interfere with dock connectors/converters.  I'll probably end up buying a dock extender from cablejive to make the case work with my current docks.  I also agree with the other reviewer who said the volume buttons are a bit hard to find on the case but overall this is minor to me.All and all I don't feel the issues are enough to knock any stars off of the rating as it is a very nice mount.

There are many ups and downs and bumps in the trails and it is hard to find a mount for my bike that hold my iphone 5 in place.  You get a cover for your phone that you push on the mount and twist it in place. The cover just slipped right on my phone and then snapped right the mount.  Prior to that I had to attach the mount on my handle bars.  They give you zip ties and large O ring like bands to do this.  The O rings were not a good long term hold for me.  I had to use the zip ties.  But everything matches and looks well on my bike.  Whenever I make a stop along the way I can just quick release my phone and take it in with me.  And if i need to answer a text or email while riding I can do so.  For me, I could not ask for anything better it is very easy to use.  I do recommend it to anyone from the casual rider to the pro.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BN7XNQW" id="B00BN7XNQW-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-04:</strong> I use it to mount my iPhone 5s on a Giant bicycle, it works very well, easy to put my phone in and take it out, and the phone stays in safe and secure.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BN7XNQW" id="B00BN7XNQW-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-07:</strong> This phone case and the clear, water-proofing pancho fit this 5s well. I like how this locks onto the mount really simply, yet securely. You have to pull up on the blue piece (see product photo) in order to detach the phone. So it snaps in easily, but only detaches when you want it to. You can operate the phone easily with the case, with or without the pancho with the 5s. The basic case also fits a 5c reasonably well, but the pancho won't fit easily over the slightly larger 5c, nor does it claim to.The difficulty can be in attaching the mount to the bike. The stem to which the mount is attached in th product photo needs to be round. On my bike--a Raleigh hybrid--it is angular, so the curved mount doesn't attach securely. Instead I have to attach it to the handlebars themselves with are already crowded. It was doable, but does give my bike a very cluttered look. So I recommend this case if you have a round stem and can mount it as shown, but not so much if you have to resort to handle bar mounting.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BN7XNQW" id="B00BN7XNQW-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-28:</strong> I'm an optimist.People seem to complain about the intrusion of technology but I see it as a blessing and mostly, as a lifesaver. As a mom, though I'm an optimist, I'm also a realist and get very nervous when my kids take off on their mountain bikes. As odd as this seems, this very simple bike mount has totally helped to calm me when the kids ride off.I tried this first myself on a ride, and LOVE it. It is sturdy and easy to take on and off. Before, I would carry my phone in my pants (which is usually where my kids would tuck their phones) - or a fanny pack (my kids REFUSE to wear a fanny pack because it's &#34;for old, nerdy people&#34;). So the phone rings while riding and though of course, you should pull over, even I'm guilty of trying to keep going while fumbling to get the phone out of my pocket (just to see if it's an emergency).This mount changes all that. It's easy to see who is calling, and even better, even with both covers on, you can still swipe and it picks up your finger motion. You can mount it horizontally or vertically and it's easy to slide out of the mount, yet secure enough not to worry about it falling out.I totally love it - and as sappy as this sounds, as a mom, it gives me peace of mind when my kids go out riding now.Love it!!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BN7XNQW" id="B00BN7XNQW-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-29:</strong> This is a fantastic mount. Here's what you should know:First and foremost, you've got to trust your bike mount. With others I've used (i.e. less pricey options) I've always worried that my expensive phone would fly off if I hit a bump just right. The connection on this one is so solid, that I found myself forgetting to take my phone off when the kids and I would stop on our bike ride (The Habit, Yogurtland, etc.) Note: the mount can be attached two ways: with 2 O-rings, or with zip-ties and the O-rings worked so well that I didn't even zip it on.In order to connect the phone, you simply pop it in a case and then pull down on the blue &#34;quad lock&#34;. Twist it on a quarter-turn, and then let the lock snap into place. One it's on, your phone isn't going anywhere. This system also allows you to put the phone in both landscape and portrait mode, depending on the application you're using.How am I using it?Initially, I used it for the GPS. My kids and I like to take bike rides though our community, and usually we just go out for X number of miles and then return. Our preference is to come home a different way than we came, so having the GPS right in front of me allows me to make decisions on the fly. In the past, I'd have to stop and plan our moves every once in a while, which spoiled the flow of our rides.After a few rides, I realized that the speaker on my phone was plenty loud enough to play music as we rode along. The phone doesn't get too loud, so it's not obnoxious like the beach-cruiser & ghetto-blaster combinations we see so much at the beach. I must say that I've lengthened many rides because my Pandora music mix was doing such a good job that I wanted to keep going.And finally, we like to use it for tracking our miles and rides using Runkeeper. This is great because we can set goals and tell our friends how much we rode.Note: The bike also comes with a clear cover for your phone. Because I didn't read about it, I assumed that it was necessary to have on the phone (it's just a clear top). While writing this review, I noticed that they call it a &#34;poncho weather resistant cover&#34; and that makes sense. When the case it on, the sensitivity of the screen is diminished but the case is really designed to put on if it were to start to sprinkle or if you were riding through muddy conditions. For it's intended purpose, it works great but if you won't be having these conditions, just leave it in your bag.Ultimately, this is a great, secure bike mount that works perfectly for my needs and looks great doing it. Because I write so many reviews, I don't often suggest products to my friends, but this will definitely be an exception. It's that awesome.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BN7XNQW" id="B00BN7XNQW-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-23:</strong> The Annex Quad Lock provides a great, secure mount for your iPhone.  The phone case is actually two parts with rubbery backing that works just like most other phone cases, and a &#34;poncho&#34; that wraps over the front of your phone to completely seal it.The case snaps onto your iPhone like a regular phone case, with holes along the sides for the buttons and the charging port.  The back slightly raised to give room for an interlocking hole for the mount to snap into.  While it definitely makes your phone thicker, it's actually a lot slimmer than I expected it to be.  The thickness of the case could cause issues with connecting to charging cradles, but my OEM Lightning cable works fine.The poncho is a rubbery, clear case that wraps over the front of your phone, completely sealing it for weather protection.  The sides of the poncho have raised bits that line up with the buttons so you'll still be able to use your phone through the protective casing.  Also, the touch screen will still work!The mount itself can be secured to your bike using the provided zip ties or rubber bands.  I went with the zip ties because they're easier to attach, but both seem like reliable options for keeping the mount attached to your bike.Other reviewers have noted that the phone case is prone to catching dust and smell debris in the back, which I've noticed too.  Attaching the poncho seems to offer some additional protection, but it also makes your phone considerably bulkier.  I usually switch to the Annex Quad Lock only when I use my bike though, and I switch back to my regular case when I'm done, so I haven't had to deal with this problem too much yet.Overall, this is a great system for securing and protecting your phone while on your bike.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BN7XNQW" id="B00BN7XNQW-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-05:</strong> This bike mount kit doesn't work with my bike stem because of the way my rather short stem comes up out of the head tube and then bends at only a 45 degree angle. (Okay, I should clarify, it doesn't fit vertically...it would work if I only wanted to mount it horizontally.) So, I had my boyfriend put it on his bike, which has a longer stem and more of a 90 degree angle like in the pictures of this product, and it fit very well and he really likes it. Because it attaches to the stem, it leaves plenty of room to mount your lights or coffee cup holders or whatever on the handlebars. It really seems like a sturdy mount and it's nice that it comes with both bands and zip ties.One other thing...looking at the little bits of plastic that make up this product, I was shocked when I saw the price. Who can put a price on keeping your phone safe and secure, right? But still...it's not even like they guarantee your phone won't get damaged and as of this writing they are charging 60 smackaroos! There are also other things you can use it with, once you have your phone in the quad lock case, like a car mount or a belt clip, but those are also expensive hunks of plastic.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BN7XNQW" id="B00BN7XNQW-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-01:</strong> Using it for over a month on TREK bike and this bike mount kit is just perfect.

The package contains two smaller mounting o-rings, two larger mounting o-rings, two zip ties, Quad Lock bike mount PRO, black hard backed plastic Quad Lock case with flexible sides, a flexible weather resistant Poncho cover, and an installation guide.Installing the Annex Quad Lock bike mount kit begins with placing the mount on the head stem or handlebars then securing the mount into place with either the o-rings or zip ties.  Snap your iPhone into the hard backed case.  Cutouts are provided for the power button, speakers, camera lens and flash, auxiliary jack, and the power input.  Then push the case at a 45 degree angle onto the mount and twist.  To remove or reposition, a locking collar on the mount needs to be pulled down.The Poncho, when used, muffles sound as it covers the speakers.  Sound can still be heard, although the quality is greatly reduced.  Additionally the front of the Poncho is streaky when the iPhone is not active.  When the iPhone is in use, the screen can be seen and touch control is not a problem, however the picture quality is also reduced.The back of the case has holes which the mount fills.  Even though the case looks good for everyday use, these same holes could allow dirt and moisture into the case when not mounted.  The camera lens/flash cutout presents the same problem, and is exposed when mounted.  While this case is securely mounted and weather resistant, I wouldn't expect much in extreme conditions.  Even on clear days, I can make a mess of my bike when mountain biking a trail with creeks and such.The same mounting system is used in other kits, potentially offering more mounting opportunities.  Alternate mounts include asports armband,car mount, adhesive mount,wall mount,tripod adapter,belt clip, and a universal adapter.For everyday road biking, the Annex Quad Lock bike mount kit is a good iPhone accessory.  While the iPhone is secured into place by this system, I wouldn't trust this mount kit to protect from dirt and moisture while mountain biking.  However, the alternate mounting options make this bike mount kit appealing.  If the conditions you ride in work for this mount kit, the Annex Quad Lock bike mount kit is worthy of your consideration.PROS:Quickly and Securely attach your iPhone to your bike/motorcycleDual stage locking mechanismInterchangeable mounting optionsWeather resistant30 day money back guarantee1 year limited warrantyCONS:Manufactured with chemicals known to cause cancer and birth defects</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BN7XNQW" id="B00BN7XNQW-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-24:</strong> When the rubberize clear cover is on you cannot use the touch screen.

The locking system keeps my phone secure and makes it easy for me to see the GPS, or change my music without crashing my bike.I was worried I would no longer be able to use the magnetic mount I have in my car, but I still can. It is not perfect, but Annex also makes a car mount, so I will eventually end up ordering that mount for my car.If you have wanted a bike mount, but were worried about stability -- look no further, this mount is the one!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BN7XNQW" id="B00BN7XNQW-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-14:</strong> This bike mount is so easy to install that my 11 year old grandson did it.

One fell off within half a mile of the starting point. We all hate seeing our iPhone fall to the floor when you are going at high speeds. It is the worst ever. I ride every week, often 30 miles at a time, and it is very helpful to keep your stats (and map!) in a place that is easy to access.The mount is very easy to install. I installed mine on the right handle bar, near the center. The center mount easy locks and unlocks from the phone case and you can carry the phone case around when you take a break or are at your destination.I have had no issues with the brackets or the mount shifting and it was held securely. The phone case makes charging or plugging your headphones accessible. The only issue that I have is that the waterproof cover makes it so you cannot plug in your headphones at all. It will completely encase your phone so the only thing you can do is see the screen.It is not completely weatherproof and I remove the phone from the case after every use. Dust and particles accumulate in the case a lot. So, great for riding but not for everyday use.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BN7XNQW" id="B00BN7XNQW-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-18:</strong> I have tried numerous mounts for my iPhone.  This one works well for several reasons.  It is very secure (although I am a little wary of the o-rings that attach the mount to the bike handles), easy to remove the phone from the bike, and has the "poncho" to keep the phone from getting wet or dirty.  On the surface it should be my favorite mount.  It isn't because I use a gel case and don't like to remove it.  This mount requires removal of your own case, no matter how thin it appears to be.  You can probably use this as your phone's case, but the mount on the back sticks out a little and I would be afraid I would hit it and compromise its strength for holding the phone.  I don't like many clear covers as they tend to hold the heat in and cause my phone to overheat.  This has primarily been a problem with waterproof covers.  I have not used this "poncho" for any length of time, so I don't know if this would happen with it.  However, the "poncho" is not very easy to remove. I would not want to use it with the base as an everyday case as it is a little cloudy.The big reason I don't like this is that you cannot use a headset and the cover.  I drilled a little hole in it to make it work as the main reason I want my phone on my bike is to listen to music.My current favorite mount isiOttie One-Touch Bike Mount Holder for iPhone 5 4S 4 3GS iPod Touch Samsung Galaxy S4 S3 S2 Nokia Lumia 920 HTC OneX EVO 4G Rhyme DROID RAZR MAXX Google Nexus LG Optimus G BlackBerry Z10 Torch Compact Size GPS.  I will probably use this on messy rides (wet, muddy, or just dusty), but not for my normal trail rides as I am too lazy to remove my case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BN7XNQW" id="B00BN7XNQW-review19" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-02:</strong> This bike mount is excellent! Its design is well thought out. It mounts securely and quickly, and includes everything needed to mount your iPhone 5 to your bike or motorcycle.The bike mount is also solid. You can mount it using either the included o-rings (two sizes included) or included zip ties. I used the o-rings and they worked perfectly, keeping the phone still, even over bumps, curbs and rough pavement. I mounted this on standard bicycle handlebars, not the ones shown in the photo.The case is quite slim in design, with a suede-like black finish. It can be used permanently as a regular case. If you already have a case on your phone, you will have to remove it to use this one. Installing your phone on the mount simply involves pushing down on the mount and twisting; you can choose either vertical or horizontal viewing. To remove your phone, reverse that process.Included in the package is a &#34;poncho&#34;, clear, weather-resistant cover. This cover completely covers your phone, but its touch-sensitive screen is very responsive, and you can still access all of your phones buttons. Because this cover completely encloses your phone for weather protection, you cannot use the headphone jack. But surprisingly, the speakers are not muted with this cover on the phone.I've tried a few bicycle phone mounts over the years, but none compare to this one. This has everything going for it. My only suggestion is that you may want to invest in a Bluetooth set of headphones. I used my corded Marley's and didn't have trouble with them getting in the way. But if you ride in all types of weather, you won't be able to use plug-ins with the poncho cover.I highly recommend this bike mount.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BN7XNQW" id="B00BN7XNQW-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-03:</strong> This item works really well.

Only thing i would suggest to those who buy it is use the zipties to connect it to your stem and not the rubber bands, i crashed and the rubber bands both snapped off somehow, i didnt hit my stem anywhere either.

It features double lock. They called it quad lock, though it looks like more of a double lock but you get the idea that it is a secured lock, and your phone will not accidentally popped out from the mount.  It is easy to install and will fit most (if not all) bikes and in several places as well (the vertical bar or horizontal bar etc). My only concern is how durable is the o-rings especially with the outdoor weather. The zip ties (also included) will be more durable. Your phone will be a bit bulkier with the quad lock case but it's not that bad. This is a great product for bikers.Sidarta Tanu</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BN7XNQW" id="B00BN7XNQW-review22" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-19:</strong> Until now, the biggest problem I&#8217;ve found with bike mounts is that you need to take off your daily-use case to use them. Annex has solved that problem by making a slim line case, with an attachment point built into the back, that is thin, lightweight, and smooth enough to be used as an everyday case. Fitment on my iPhone 5 was perfect and the attachment point on the bike easily fit the stem on my Trek Domane.It also comes with a weather cover that slips on and off of the case relatively easily to protect your phone from moisture. If you wanted to, you could leave it on the phone all the time since the touchscreen is still usable through the cover, but it&#8217;s nice to be able to remove it for a cleaner view. I was unable to get the clear part of the cover completely clean. It appeared to have been lightly fogged in a few spots but they were not visible once the cover was on the phone and the phone was turned on.The connection method is quite secure yet easy to attach and detach. The phone case turns 45 to snap into place but requires releasing a catch before turning the phone 45 to release it; no worries about bumping it and accidentally releasing the phone.The mount on the bike is secure but not permanent. O-rings style straps hold it in place and a couple of included zip-ties can make it more secure. It has a rubber piece built in to the underside of the mount to prevent slipping so that the phone holds steady when riding.Only time will tell how well the case will hold up in daily use, but it feels pretty tough (not like an otter box, but good enough) and I expect it to hold up well for at least a year. I&#8217;ll update this if I notice any flaws over time.Annex makes a few other mounts that this case will connect to including one for your car dash or window. I&#8217;m not an advocate of distracted driving, but having the phone securely mounted where you can see it easily seems like a good idea for changing music or seeing a GPS map.It&#8217;s a great idea that seems well-implemented with one major issue: at nearly $70 it feels a bit overpriced. Then again, that&#8217;s typical for a special-use, low-volume production part such as this.I recommend this case to anyone wanting to mount their iPhone to their bike securely and easily, and willing to pay a premium to protect their valuable smartphone asset.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BN7XNQW" id="B00BN7XNQW-review23" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-25:</strong> Having your mobile phone available when riding is almost as common now as having it when you're driving or running. I've found the Annex Quad Lock Bike Mount Kit is a nice way to have my iPhone available during a ride without the risk of it flying off (or running off the road while trying to look at it).The bracket is the main selling point for me. The bracket itself straps onto the handlebar post using either rubberized O-rings or zip ties. I opted for the zip ties as it feels a lot more secure. The iPhone case attaches to the bracket with a locking mechanism that doesn't release the phone unless you push down on the attachment post. Once it clicks into place, it's not coming off. The case itself is a hard plastic (polycarbonate) that will protect against scratches and drops fairly well (but I hope I never have to test that out).It also comes with a clear cover for if/when it rains and you want to protect your iPhone from the weather. It's OK, but it's not something you'd leave on all the time (it blocks the jacks when you use it). You could probably do a little &#34;creative engineering&#34; to cut out part of the clear cover in the jack area, but I would have expected that to be part of the design.Overall, this is now part of my bike and will (likely) remain there until I upgrade phones.Disclosure:Obtained From: Amazon Vine Review ProgramPayment: Free</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BN7XNQW" id="B00BN7XNQW-review24" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-23:</strong> This excellent little buy has been helping me get in shape by allowing me to mount it not only to a bike but also to a stroller. We just had a new baby and I like to take her to the park, but sometimes I want to walk with her and listen to something at the same time and this has done me a service. I had wondered about the advertised adaptability offered by this device, so I also tried it out with more than one model type and was pleased that it has an easy adjustment as well. The one con I have noticed is an issue another reviewer also noted, which is debris building up inside the case and needing to be cleaned quite regularly. That is disturbing in a way because protection should take into account the terrain that it is being utilized on. Still, if you are aware of it, this can be a minor obstacle at best.I will update this more as time passes to see about durability and about the accumulation issues.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00BN7XNQW', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00BN7XNQW', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B004I53BK4</h2>    <p class="price"> $B004I53BK4</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004I53BK4" id="B004I53BK4-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-24:</strong> This cover is very nice, it just covers the back of the phone, and fits perfectly.

I was advised that they would work it out and contact me.Second attempt: after a few days with no contact from Telestial, I went online again and this time it gave me a US (Sacramento area) phone number!  So I called it and left a voicemail or two and sent a text or two.  Never any indication that I had received a v-mail or text. Called the helpdesk again, got another patient and helpful rep and she was able to walk me through the process of receiving voicemail (it is completely unlike anything you've ever experienced and is far from intuitive, but it does indeed work...you just have to learn to ignore messages like "not supported by SIM" and sit tight waiting for something else to happen).  I asked how I would be able to know if I got a voicemail or text; she investigated and found that my assigned US number couldn't receive texts due to a tech issue.  Since you learn that you have a v-mail by receiving a text message, this made it impossible to know if you got either one.  So she disabled my text-challenged US number, assigned me a new US number and sent a text to the new number as a test.  It never arrived.  She elevated the issue for further evaluation.Third attempt: to be determined.  I'll update this in a few days as I was promised an email or some other communication to let me know if they've figured this out.  Come to think of it, that was the outcome of the first attempt.  No sense in dwelling on the past, though.If I can't understand how to use this in the US at my leisure, I'm not willing to bet that I can get it working in Europe when I hope to have better things to do with my leisure.  &lt;sarcasm>But for only five bucks, I've gotten hours of entertainment out of this SIM card so far!&lt;/sarcasm>I do want to stress that the support people seem genuinely interested and I think they are trying hard to help make this work, very commendable for such an inexpensive product.  But PLEASE pay attention to the other reviews that encourage you to test and practice with this before you leave on your trip.  Even if it works fine for you right out of the box, there is a non-trivial learning curve and in my experience so far, this is anything but plug and play.Update Friday 3/30/2012Telestial is serious about customer service and they do pay attention to comments on Amazon unlike many other vendors.  I got a replacement package yesterday (UPS next day air of all things - it cost them more to send the replacement than I paid for the card to begin with!).  I've been playing around with it but haven't had time to update this review properly yet.  Briefly, I would now give this 5 stars except for (1) the couple of bad false starts combined with the fact that (2) I haven't taken this out of the country yet, so I'm still a little skittish.  I will update further and almost certainly go to 4 stars over the weekend.  So don't let the glitches I experienced dissuade you from seriously considering this - these people want you to be happy and will go to extremes, in my view, to make you so.  More later.Update Sunday 4/1/2012The replacement card I'm using now does everything Telestial says it will and is entirely worthy of 5 stars.  No, I haven't been overseas with it yet but am convinced I got an incurably buggy card (account, US number, whatever) on the first attempt.  If this replacement isn't reliable during my travels please believe that I will have plenty to say about it when I return.  But for now, I recommend these folks because they actually gave a cr*p and got things working for me.I would only reiterate that if you buy this or *any* SIM for overseas use, and then just stick the shrinkwrapped package into your luggage assuming that you've taken care of that detail, you are asking for trouble and deserve what you get.  Make your decision and do your evaluating/testing well ahead of time, so that you and your vendor have time to work out the kinks.These guys are good.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004GV13VY" id="B004GV13VY-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-06-24:</strong> The US phone number was not printed on the card, but I found out it was sent as a text message.  The international pin prefix number on the card does not match the written materials so I tried to call customer service but never got anyone after 1/2 hour and gave up.  Another call to customer service later did give an answer and their emails were very prompt.I received $10 credit for writing this review and another $5 credit for setting up the Journal thing with 5 emails so I had $20 in credits for $4.50.  Nice deal.  Since it costs about 80 cents to text you need about this much money for a decent road trip.The plan was to have people leave a voice mail if they really really needed to get a hold of me.  I used it on a trip around Italy, Greece and Turkey and the free voice mail worked in all three.  I also sent a journal text message when going to new towns although sometimes these would have been logged automatically anyway.The Journal thing is worth doing, but be advised it costs 9 cents every time someone just looks at the map.

I've used this service three times in the last five years. This last time was the only time it did not work out of the plane for me, which ended up being a major inconvenience due to a situation which arose.  I ended up having to call their customer support from a pay phone the following day to get it to work though it was a toll free number.  I still am not sure what the issue was. I was told to press 1 then the pin number. This was never mentioned in the literature.  Also, if you have your phone on 3G and data roaming off, it did not work. You must also insert the data settings of the Passport service in order for it to work. I was (Paris) never able to get it to roam on any carrier but Orange this trip and  in the past it would  roam on all 3 visible carriers.  This also was never mentioned in the literature.It seemed easiest and safest for me to turn off 3G and just use the 2G network.  Also, you cannot send pictures using mms, so plan on using data to do that via e-mail or any other app you may have to do this. The call back was quicker this trip than in the past. But, I'm just plain getting tired of the hassle of trying to save money on international roaming and am not gonna pay regular carrier rates.  Enough of this for me. I'll be purchasing local sims next time I travel. I have also been using a VoIP app on my phone to make calls using wifi.  This is free and surprisingly, a better quality call than using cell service.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B004GV13VY', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B004GV13VY', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B005T0DT2W</h2>    <p class="price"> $B005T0DT2W</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005T0DT2W" id="B005T0DT2W-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-04-09:</strong> I have been anti case for so long, mainly because they are ugly and bulky.This case is neither. I love the look and feel! This is a must get for the iPhone 4S!I'm guessing Spec has changed their packaging...

So, I'm changing my rate for this product from 5 to 2 stars only.# Update (Oct, 14 2012):My last 4 Speck Cases were bad bad bad quality!!In there website [...] they claim (there is fake knock-offs)..

The first was the Amazon Basics case, which is clear with some kind of circular line pattern on the back. Not bad at all for the $8 cost, but it has this irritating sharp edge on the back which made it feel bad in my hands.  It didn't add much bulk or weight to the phone, but in the end this edge just got on my last nerve (this must come with age, but I could not overcome it).So, I found this case which is highly reviewed here on Amazon.  I have to give credit to the other reviews posting about this case before me.  I really like this case.  Offers lots of protection and looks good.  I like the extra grips and the harder plastic parts which helps to maintain the looks of the iPhone 4s.  I have the white/black to go with my white 4S.  There is a nice wide opening for the camera & flash, so no worries about washout when using the flat (a big issue with many cases). The buttons work well but the volume buttons are probably a little harder to use than the on/off button. The headphone jack opening seems small, but it works fine with the headphones I already own (but you way want to pay attention to this before ordering).  There is another port for a another ring/silent button, and the case cases it to be rather deep, but I can reach it easily with a fingernail. I don't think you want this button changed easily anyway.In short, I am very happy with this product.  I wish I could say such about most of the products I buy. Congrats to Speck.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005T0DT2W" id="B005T0DT2W-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-07-04:</strong> Nice product.

I've had very good luck with the otterbox commuter but wanted a change of pace.  It feels good in your hand an looks sharp, but I'm a little worried about it cracking after reading all the reviews of it online  they made the opening for the dock connector large, making older cables compatible, but by doing to the plastic along the top is very thin.

Nice side grips. Not too bulky like other heavy duty covers. Opening around camera doesn't obstruct the flash.  Looks super cool.Cons- Thick on the bottom. Can't plug into a dock without removing the cover completely. Buttons are a little stiff. No vent holes.Overall, it's an awesome case. I bought another one in a different color. I've done way more research on Amazon than I should looking for the ideal case. If it weren't for the dock part, and slightly stiff buttons, I'd call it the perfect iPhone 4S case. Although if they ever redesign this case, some vent holes would be nice. The iPhone gets hot if you use apps for a long period.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005T0DT2W" id="B005T0DT2W-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-10:</strong> I have dropped my phone way too many times, even from my dorm room loft onto tile floor, my phone is protected very well by this case.

I used it for months but was disappointed when the slimmer parts of the plastic started cracked - like around the volume buttons and on one corner.  I thought it was perfect in the beginning, sleek yet it doesn't slide out of your pocket because of the rubberized grips.  My son has had several SPECK cases and he didn't have the same problem but he changes them up more than I do.

This case is offers great protection and style for a decent price. I'm surprised how ell it actually works because of some negative reviews. I do occasionally play games on my iPhone 4 and the grip helps a lot, even when it's not being used for gaming. The rubber bumps built into the bezel help with the lay on the table design as well as serving a purpose whilst gaming. I do have to say I have a Sprint phone and one of the sides is looser than the other. I'm not sure if this is caused by a small nick in my phone on the looser side, or simply because it is a sprint iPhone 4. Other than  that it's a great case, and I've used it for the past week or so and had no peeling rubber. The color (I bought the blue) decides how well the scratches show, on the blue it is really only noticeable in bright light. Maybe its just me but I think the blue color in the picture is off, its a lighter color in real life. The case scratches somewhat easily but it is better than scratching your phone. I'm 99.9% sure this is a genuine Speck case. No problems with flash. Overall I recommend it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005T0DT2W" id="B005T0DT2W-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-27:</strong> I love Speck covers for my phone, in fact it's the only brand that I buy.

Upon holding it for the first time, my first impression was how smooth and slick the case was. I am positive the thing would slip from my hand a couple times a week if I didn't do something. After some research, I settled on the Speck CandyShell Grip case. After a couple months, I am very happy with my selection. Here's why this case works for me:- The ribbed black rubber areas on the outside provides plenty of grip no matter how I hold the phone. The same textured areas reduce skidding when I place the phone on a hard surface like a desktop, making it harder for me to accidentally knock it to the floor.- The combination hard shell and soft rubber insert fit like a glove with no gaps at the corners.- The rubber insert extends beyond the face of the phone so I can place it face down without marring the screen protector.- The phone's controls and ports are easily usable without removing the case.- The case doesn't add too much bulk for me and it easily fits in my coat pocket.Finally, the case is holding up well (I don't tend to abuse my gear) and shows no signs of wear and tear yet.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005T0DT2W" id="B005T0DT2W-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-07-01:</strong> Case is thin, light weight and easy to hold on to.

It doesn't look completely clear when you take it off the paper, but when you put in on the Galaxy it does appear clear. It's easy to put on, but I find I have a small portion of the edge that isn't sticking and I have to keep pressing it down. It is easy to move your finger around the screen without any drag and it does seem to help against the glare. I have tried the ones that guarantee to protect against scratches and they are more like heavy tape, not stiff and much harder to put on. The finger doesn't slide as well on those either. I don't know if the Belkin protects as well, but it looks nicer on and is easier to use. It seems like a good product and priced right, especially since you get two.UPDATE:i love sitting in myfront yard, drinking my coffee and reading my kindle books on my samsung galaxy 8.9 via my free kindle app, but was i surprise how beautiful the screen is nowthat i havethe glare free screen protector on.

The matte surface does a pretty good job of evening out glare.  It doesn't eliminate it, but rather softens it so that you see some reflection, but you can't make out specific objects.The bad parts are that the matte surface changes the characteristic of the screen, especially with bright ambient light. It isn't as noticeable in dark situations, but the matte surface causes a little bit more blurriness compared to a clear screen protector.The second thing I don't like is the thickness of the screen protector.  The edges seem to get caught on things pretty easily, which then lifts the edge and allows bubbles to form around the edges.  Otherwise, it was easy to position and fairly forgiving with mistakes.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006LVZCXM" id="B006LVZCXM-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-03-15:</strong> I obtained this Belkin touchscreen for the Samsung Galaxy at the same time I tried out the Belkin iphone protector sheet.  Unlike the iphone sheet, i found that this product was actually easier to apply (strange- it's bigger, but I had less trial and error to avoid air bubbles).  Since the iphone protector was not that difficult anyway, this was really a breeze.  One might wonder why you'd need a screen protector in general, other than the obvious use of preventing scratched glass (which i'd never really had a problem with anyway).  I actually prefer overlays due to the way the light reflects more softly from the surface, and the way my finger glides more easily over the surface of the screen.  I highly recommend the belkin line of screen protector products, because they are easy to use and apply, cause no loss of touch sensitivity, and because of the non-glare aspect of the resulting surface.  I think these products are definitely mandatory, and should probably be included with the product to begin with!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006LVZCXM" id="B006LVZCXM-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-04-19:</strong> I get that the matte version is supposed to be easier for reading in the sun, but I honestly don't see enough of a difference to put up with the slightly different color variation it causes or the muted color in general.If you're looking for a matte one for your Galaxy, it's not a bad choice, but I would recommend looking at the glossy.

Does not have a significant affect on the touch screen sensitivity, though it is a little less slippery than the naked glass. The matte finish does resist finger prints better than the naked glass.

I don't own a Samsung Galaxy 2 so I'm actually cutting this to make screen protectors for my Lumix camera.  I found this overlay to be far superior to the one I'd been using previously.  It is thicker and therefore much easier to apply without any bubble problems.  They included a screen cleaning cloth and a smoothing card to facilitate a perfect installation.  I'll get approximately 16 protectors from this package which will be more than I'll need for the life of the camera.The thickness does not in any way interfere with the touch screen capabilities of my camera. The matte surface provides excellent visibility and glare reduction in any light.  The package includes 2 protectors sized for the Samsung Galaxy but which could be trimmed for use on any camera or cell phone screen.  Obviously, it is intended for a specific device but I think the material would proved superior protection for any touch screen equipment.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006LVZCXM" id="B006LVZCXM-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-03-14:</strong> The protector is very well designed and it fits my galaxy tab very well. And it significantly reduces the glare (the galaxy tab comes with a glossy screen so without the screen protector, it reflexes a good amount of light into my eyes.) Would definitely recommend it.

Not really enough to be a bother, and this is true of many protectors. Just increase the brightness a little bit. It includes the typical cardboard applicator - I hate these. A credit card usually works better.I've tried a lot of protectors, including various Belkin. There are some important tips to remember when installing these:1) The device must be CLEAN, static and lint free. I use alcohol to clean it, followed by a lint free cloth, followed by a dry-air blow from a bulb (same one I use for my cameras)2) The protector must be static free - you can use anti-static spray on the protective cover, or wipe it with a dryer sheet. Apply to the "up" side.3) clean and dry your hands4) Peel off the protective sheet and apply - do this under a bright light with the device off. Lint and bubbles show up clearly against a black surface. The light just helps with application and spotting dirt before you apply.Static is the #1 cause for bubbles - tiny bits of crud are attracted to the protective cover when you remove the thin protective covering. This causes a static charge and is a magnet for dirt.Follow the anti-static and screen cleaning process and you'll have a nice, perfect - debris free cover.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006LVZCXM" id="B006LVZCXM-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-19:</strong> I have to admit I was hesitant about ordering these for my Galaxy but I bit the bullet because I had severely scratched the screen on my last one and wanted protection this time around.  You have to read the directions and apply carefully onto a clean surface (I recommend a room with a little humidity to keep the static electricity and dust down to a minimum).  But with carefull application and patience in the process you can wind up with a screen cover with minimum bubbles if any.  I got mine on with two tiny bubbles in opposite corners that defy all attempts at flattening out but they're minimal and overall I dont even see them with the screen on.  My older brother got his on cleanly (of course).  I also like the matte finish as it cuts down on glare quite a bit and less fingerprints as well.  Just take your time.  Read the directions.  And don't expect perfection.  Then if you get it you'll be showing it around to your friends for a month ecstatic with your accomplishment!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006LVZCXM" id="B006LVZCXM-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-04:</strong> This is fairly easy to use.  Just clean your screen real good before installing the protector.  Read the instructions, peel the back and carefully put into the proper position.  Then you take the miniature squeegee, and press all of the tiny bubbles out, which works pretty well.  Doesn't seem to affect the sensitivity of the screen to any degree.  Protects and reduces glare on the screen.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006LVZCXM" id="B006LVZCXM-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-04-28:</strong> I'm pretty impressed with Belkin's line of screen protectors, and this one is no exception.

Thankfully this Belkin protector is stiffer than the ones I have used before and laying it down without trapping a huge number of bubbles was pretty easy.  I had to lift it and re-press it a few times, and I managed to lean over it and get some dust to fall on the screen as I was applying, but lifting the corner and using a spot of tape to remove the dust from the glass worked wonders.  I applied the protector in the bathroom after running a hot shower for 10 minutes, waiting about 5 (fan off, door closed) to try to get the dust out of the air, and it really seemed to help.The matte finish is pretty nice, it seems to cut down on glare a little bit, but not as much as I hoped (broad daylight is still problematic), and fingerprints aren't as big a problem as I thought.  Unfortunately, nothing beats naked glass (with a little RainX to keep the fingerprints at bay, google it, it works great), but I can live with the feel of this protector if it means reducing the odds of scratching or gouging the glass.I did end up removing this after a few days, the TPU case I get it in and out of wraps just over the front edge, and after a couple cycles it caused the edge of the screen protector to lift, and it collected enough dust that I couldn't get it to apply.  If you plan on using this with a case that attaches from the back and over the front edge, trim the screen protector just slightly to keep them from coming together.  It's okay that I had to remove it, though, I have another screen protector to review next!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006LVZCXM" id="B006LVZCXM-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-04-24:</strong> This screen protector has good thickness and yet, it's not stiff at all.  I was able to apply it very easily and had minimum bubbles, which for me is a big deal since I seem to always end up with tons of bubbles.  It is very easy to clean (just wipe off) and my fingers just slide through it like nothing.It includes a little cardboard piece that should help squeeze those bubbles away, but I ended up pressing too hard and bent the edge of the cardboard at first try defeating its purpose.  I then used the little piece of hard plastic I got with my phone and that helped - I had to work really hard on the corners though.Regarding the visibility, it definitely makes a difference between a bare screen and one with a protector.  Depending on what's being displayed, the screen might need to be adjusted for brightness and color.  I didn't have much of a problem.I still think that there's room for improvement since it is still difficult to read just under the sun, but other than that, I really like it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006LVZCXM" id="B006LVZCXM-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-29:</strong> These screen protectors work very well and are very easy to apply.  The sheets are thick enough that they don't flex extensively when you are attempting to line them up to apply them to the device and I found that I was able to apply the first protector the first time without having to retry.  There were no bubbles under the protector and it didn't take any time at all to apply.  This is a pretty solid  point of endorsement, as I am not good at applying these things overall.The one thing I don't like is that fingerprints are fairly visible on the protectors... more so than another brand of anti-glare protectors I have used.  This isn't a deal breaker, as the anti-glare coating is not as opaque as others and the image doesn't look fuzzy through it.  I suppose you have to balance things out and think about what is more important.  I choose better visibility.There are two protectors in the package in case you mess up horribly applying one, or wear one out/scratch it.Overall, this is a good value for a good product.4/5 starsRECOMMENDED</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006LVZCXM" id="B006LVZCXM-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-28:</strong> This protector lives up to its name. It has a non-glare finish and leaves the screen readable without interfering with touch.The package contains two protector sheets, a cloth, and a smoothing card. The biggest reason many users will need two protector sheets is that it's easy to make a mistake if you've never applied one of these before. I've had that experience with previous screen protectors for different devices, and was glad I had an extra so I didn't throw my money away. With this one, I had no problems applying it.  The smoothing card is not something that comes with all screen protectors, and gives you an extra edge (literally) in eliminating bubbles.The material is on the thick side compared to some protectors, which is good, since it's not so thick that it would impede viewing the screen but thick enough that it should be durable.Aside from that, it's similar in design to a lot of others on the market. But beware of cheap ones that need trimming or need to have recesses cut for anything. Those tend to be difficult to smooth uniformly and are more likely to have bubbles or a distorted view.I've used lower cost custom fit screen protectors for other devices, and my experience has been that even cheap ones can work well. But those were for smaller devices and did not have the anti-glare feature. As a percentage of the cost of your device, these are not expensive. But if you want to get a cheaper one, don't expect to find a package that includes the cloth and smoothing tool.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B006LVZCXM', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B006LVZCXM', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B0095PCLRG</h2>    <p class="price"> $B0095PCLRG</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0095PCLRG" id="B0095PCLRG-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-17:</strong> I bought it just to add accessories to my phone but it proves a challenge to use as I have to take off my phone case and everything.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0095PCLRG" id="B0095PCLRG-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-29:</strong> It didn't work and although inexpensive, I really don't like throwing money out the door for nothing.

The LG840G phone is relatively small, very thin, and generally slippery, making it too easy to fumble and drop it.  This gel skin takes care of the slipperiness problem, and provides some protection against accidental bumps; in my opinion it is a must-have for anyone who does not have a hard case (like an Otterbox) for their LG840G phone.NOTE: No gel skin will protect a cell phone from damage if dropped onto concrete, rock, or tile, so you still want to be careful to not drop your phone. This skin does make it much easier to keep a secure hold on the phone to prevent accidental drops, so it's certainly worth the $6.00 price.Impressions on product Quality: The overall size is perfect. The skin is an exact fit and grips the phone at least as firmly as the other gel skin I purchased for my Samsung Galaxy MP3 player.  Note: these gel skins are by nature flexible, so it is possible to peel the skin off the phone if pulled forcibly from a pocket or purse.  The openings for the charger cord, headphone plug, camera lens, and microphone are properly placed. Mine is the green color, there are several other colors available from this manufacturer.Overall Rating: Highly recommended.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BUBE3N8" id="B00BUBE3N8-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-31:</strong> Nice at the price and love the color.

This cover is a semi-translucent, gelly-type (yeah, like my daughter's clear beach shoes), dark grey colored, cover for the phone. It fits snug on the phone, covering the buttons on the side, but leaving openings for the camera, and ports on top and mic on bottom. The cover lines up at the bevel on top and adds a lip of  ~1/8" (or 1mm) for drop protection of the screen.Likes: Excellent fit, nice feel to cover, doesn't add much to weight.Dislike: Because the buttons are covered and not exposed, you need to push on raised portions of the cover. This 'can' be harder than before. The camera and volume buttons match perfectly, but the same size button template was used for the power, so it's too big. Just make sure to not push on the bottom of the molded button and you'll be ok.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0047K8SVM" id="B0047K8SVM-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-04-24:</strong> I bought this case because the one I bought from the ATT store broke.

I have to say that the circle patters look better on the picture than on the octual product. The Styluses (Styli?) that come with the phone are a nice adition for free I thought it was a great idea especially for someone with big fingers like me. but it seems to me you have to press too hard on the screen for them to work.

The silicone cases offer decent protection and fit well, but they have a tendency to attract pocket lint and dust. So, I decided to get a case made out of TPU plastic like the one my wife has on her iPhone 4. I would like to say, if you can find a decent TPU case that fits well, go for it. But, this TPU case doesn't fit well at all. The area around the phone display does not cover the bezel very well. Compared to my silicone case, the TPU case offered less protection. Also, the areas covering the buttons are almost flat! I found it difficult to detect the phone buttons by touch, because the areas were not raised like my silicon case. This also presented anothet problem. The TPU case was applying slight pressure on my phone buttons. So, when I pressed the power button to "wake up" my phone, the phone started to shutdown. This happened on more than one occassion and was extremely frustrating. Yes, I could carve out the phone button slots with an X-acto knife, but why bother? By the way, the circle patterns didn't look very masculine on my phone either. This product also included a stylus twin-pack, but they are worthless on the Samsung Focus since it has a multi-touch screen (how are you going to pinch-to-zoom with these things?).

I have to press a little harder on the right side volume buttons, but the power button works just as good as without the sleeve.I might take a chance, because this was so cheap, and cut out the covers for the camera, power and volume buttons and see how that goes.

I had a LG Voyager and loved it and waiting for the new one to come out and I will jump ship as soon as the new one comes out.  I updated the new software but still the same.  All I can Say is even though all the experts are saying the Iphone is better.  I will never ever buy anything from Apple, cause I just think their products are garbage.  I still can't believe the new 3G Iphone still does not support music streaming and the Itunes software is trash.  Well enough bout my babbling on the piece of crap Apple products. I just hope RIM fixes all the bugs or they'll lose many customers.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001HN5BPS" id="B001HN5BPS-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2009-05-03:</strong> If this phone worked as it should it would be acceptable at best, but a number of software problems make it something you will probably want to avoid.The email feature is very good, although it only checks for email from most ISP servers every 15 minutes, and there is no way to force it check for new mail at your convenience. To get around this you must have all your email forwarded to a service like Hotmail or Yahoo, which means you will get copies of your email immediately. However, if you want to reply, you will not be able to change your reply-from account from Hotmail to your main ISP email provider. You'll have to wait 15 minutes until the original email comes through.When you are in a call, the screen goes dark quickly, and it requires a lot of maneuvering to get a keyboard up if you have to press keys during your call or even if you want to switch to speaker phone mode.Trying to type an email or text takes real perseverance. The default "Sure Type" mode that suggests words is cumbersome, and changing its suggestions can be maddening. Even in landscape mode with a QWERTY keyboard, an auto-correct feature takes over and requires constant vigilance. And just TRY to use the touch-and-click screen to reposition the insertion point and make a correction several letters or words back; it's really frustrating.The manual that comes with the phone and the various online tutorials don't begin to cover what you need to know to use the phone's features; you will need to attend a Verizon workshop.All of the above assumes that phone actually works as it's supposed to. After spending hours with Verizon and BlackBerry support staff, I finally got the phone to the point where it works much of the time, which is a giant step up from the way the phone came out of the box.Here are some of the problems, all of which BlackBerry acknowledges as "known issues" and which Verizon will tell you SHOULD be addressed in a long-promised and long-overdue software upgrade (think Windows Vista):* Voice-command dialing (e.g., via Bluetooth headset) sometimes results in a white screen that locks up your phone and requires one or more reboots (a reboot means removing the battery for 15 seconds, replacing it, and waiting 4 to 6 minutes until you can use the phone again).* The battery drains quickly and sometimes continues to drain when plugged into a charger; it may require one or more reboots to start charging.* Synching the Storm with Outlook can result in errors that prevent this feature from working until you spend many hours with support staff trying to find which record causes the problem; the fix will last a couple of days, before the problem recurs.* The network connection turns itself off occasionally, and you won't be able to make or receive calls until you notice that the network is off and you go into the options to turn it back on.In order to get around the Bluetooth lock-ups, I purchased aBlackBerry HS-655+ Bluetooth Headset, which the manual recommends. It has cut down on, but not eliminated, the number of lock-ups.The most helpful support person was a Verizon tech who had me "wipe" the phone and start over (choose the "Options" button, then "Security Options," then "General Settings," then press the menu button and choose "Wipe Handheld"; all the software reloads automatically, but you will have to reload any personal data). That helped with most of the problems, including the Outlook synch problem, which hasn't recurred (it's been 10 days).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001HN5BPS" id="B001HN5BPS-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2009-01-11:</strong> There are some pretty chatty reviewers here so I'll just bottom line it for you. As a web browser and general all-around application tool, the Storm is far superior to the Bold (and the Curve) due to it's large touch screen. As a mail READER, the Storm is also superior.As alluded to by numerous other reviewers, the only non-superior aspect of the device is the maximum speed at which a user can type out a message. For generating email & text, a traditional quality keyboard such as on the Curve (and to a lessor extent the Bold) will actualize your maximum typing speed... if that's what's most important to you.For me, the ease of navigating screens and applications (to include READING email) via the touch screen is far more important than maximum typing speed (I have an office computer and a notebook with broadband; either of which I will use to generate most of my wordy emails. I use the blackberry mostly to keep abreast of what's going on while away from those primary computing tools). Using the trackball of the Bold and the Curve is much more cumbersome for the regular away from desk tasks of reading email, browsing the web, updating Twitter, etc.There is also currently a socio-capitalistic elitism to be enjoyed by having the touch screen of the Storm (sure, deny it if you want, and hate me for bringing it up, but you know in your heart that like me, you enjoy having the coolest new toy in the office, and this is it!).Summary: I read 30 email messages a day on my phone, but only respond or generate a few... the keyboard's maximum typing speed is of secondary concern for you if you share my same use model (and the web browsing on the Storm, like the iPhone, is absolutely joyous!)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001HN5BPS" id="B001HN5BPS-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2009-02-24:</strong> The best way to put it is...Love mine!, the point being that it takes a while to get used to it, but once you do, you get the unbeatable blackberry email and almost everything else you get in the iphone.The screen resolution and brightness is totally HD!I went for it over iphone as I needed the Blackberry email, calendar features etc. and now that I have it for a over a month or two, its hard to put it down. Am totally comfortable with typing as I don't need to email Grey's anatomy every day (it's a thick medical reference book:-)...you get the point.The way i look at it is that if your work environment is blackberry based, which i believe is true for most corporate environments, you'd certainly feel more comfortable with blackberry over iphone.For all rest, iphone may represent better value!Gave it four stars as RIM still has their work cut out on the software side, but don't be mislead by it, they seem to be on top of it and should have it sorted out soon.In the end, both devices represent great value, you need to work out what serves you better!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001HN5BPS" id="B001HN5BPS-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2009-02-28:</strong> I wanted to love this phone but having a screen that clicks just was not a good design.  The mere fact that you have to press, then let go to register a click makes it inherently slow. Plus you cant type without making a lot of racket, like during a business meeting or at the movies.  Maybe RIM should give you the option to turn clicking off so u can use it like any old touch screen.The device actually has gaps between the screen and the rest of the body, allowing dust and dirt to get into your phone!  On some on the shipped storms, clicks were not registering on the outer edges of the screen, necessitating uses to stuff paper, etc. in the battery compartment to make the storm work correctly.  Are u friggin kidding me? lolThe worse part of typing is actually the keyboard software itself.  Try typing any combination of numbers and letters and you are in for an experience.  Too many button presses are required to alternate between numbers and letters.  Touch screen keyboards have been around for ever.  You'd think RIM would give you something new that works well.  The storm landscape keyboard isn't as good as my old win mobile on screen keyboard from years ago.If you are use to bb's with a trackball, you are going to find navigating the storm a pain.  Try scrolling any long page.  It takes forever.  Maybe they will put a trackball on the next storm, or at least give u accelerated flicking like u see in the iphone.I wont even mention the slow camera, check error, random reboots, slow accelerometer, bad browser, etc since those things may get fixed if they haven't been already.  Just dont expect to be able to run lots of apps like you see on the iphone.  It's simply not going to happen.I'll be using the bb curve until verizon release the bb storm or the palm pre.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001HN5BPS" id="B001HN5BPS-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-05:</strong> This phone case was bought for my teenager who drops her phone all the time and this one was bought to replace another she said its working good so far though</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001HN5BPS" id="B001HN5BPS-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2009-02-08:</strong> As our own President Obama can attest to it, it is really hard to go back to any other phone once you become accustomed to using a blackberry.I am usually all things apple.  I use mac, own several of ipods..etc, but when it comes to mobile phone use, I just couldn't give up using a bberry(coming from Curve & pearl).  ( I played around with iPhone for a month but it really wasn't any different than ipod touch that I had because the phone was pretty much useless with all the dropped calls)With the Storm, I'm no longer require to carry a business phone, personal phone, ipod or a portable DVD player.About the only "con" I can think of about the storm is that, I can not type as fast as I used to on the Curve.( but then again, I don't think i can type as fast on any touch screen phone)also, the plug is micro USB instead of miniUSB.  which mean I can no longer use the car charger from my other bberries/or motorola chargers...MotoQ or razr.By no means, this is a perfect phone.  It has it's imperfactions.  But then again, other winMO, treo or iphone have their share of short comings or faults as well.  Yes, storm does freeze, resets once in awhile(which seemed to have stopped with OS upgrade).  But to me this really isn't a "con" as seeing that every other phone out there will all freeze/reset occasionally.  That's just a nature of electronics.  I mean, have you owned a smartphone/mac/PC that didn't freeze or stall on you once in awhile(ctrl+alt+Del)??Having few months under my belt, I can say that lot of the problems people have addressed in their reviews are fixable with OS upgrade and/or by having settings set correctly.  I've been an early adapter for phones like MOTO Q, Treos, and iPhone.  Compared to those phones, I think RIM is coming along just fine as far as working out the kinks and having bugs fixed thru OS updates.  Even the iphone fanboys have to admit, it took them almost a year before iphone became where it's at current state.Now to some things I like about this phone.- Verizon network coverage..  Call quality is superb as usual just like all of my past Bberries.  not 1 dropped call.(might be a RIM hardware thing, cuz my Moto Q used to drop calls once in awhile)**set aside all the bells and whistles, this should be your most important factor in choosing a phone.  I'm not suggesting Verizon has best coverage in your area..  I'm sure there are areas verizon lacks coverage where others excel at.- instant email & Blackberry Messenger  (2 things that no other phones can compare/compete with and what makes it my "crackberry")- being able to use AIM, Yahoo MSGer, google talk all simultaneously  (waiting on Jivetalk to come out with  the update, which will enable me to use 1 program for all IM programs)- visual voice mail(being able to check vmail without having to call in...shows lengh of msg, who it's from..etc before you even check the actual message)- shooting videos, being able to upload online(eg. youtube) rightaway, or sending via MMS- takes great quality of photos (easy upload to flkr, facebook..etc)- using Trapster, getting warnings about upcoming speedtraps, camera lights is a lifesaver($$$ saver too)- streaming online radios (Moodio, flycast..etc)- Being able to wirelessly sync(google sync) contacts, calendar with Google acct.- Full fuctional GPS with 3rd party apps.  (trapster, Nav4all..etc)- Full HTML browsings  (if BB browser doesn't do it for you, check out BOLT browser)- being able to just drag&drop; movies, songs, ringtones, pics straight into storm without 3rd party app. (both on Mac and PC) you can use it like a flash Drive or external Hard Drive.- Great Media player  (viewing photos, music, Video)  Watching a full length movie on the storm is amazing.  Really no other phone out there can compare to quality of this screen  except maybe Blackberry BOLD.- Being able to listen to music/movie via bluetooth headset/speaker or having it piped thru my car stereo via bluetooth using (Motorokr T505)- not sure what other documents it can open/view, but I was able to open MS word, Excel, Powerpoint slide show, & Adobe PDF files no problems on storm.- being able to tether via bluetooth to use as wireless modem for my laptop.- Being able to changeout batteries and micro SD card.  (Those long plane rides are not so long anymore with 2 extra batteries and a extra 16GB cards along with 8GB card that came with the phone)*I covert my DVD's to 600-700MB sized file, so you can imagine how many movies I can carry on a 16GB card.-being able to Multitask.  eg. I can listen to streaming radio while my AIM is online in the backgroud and I'm checking my email.- Being able to have it "Unlocked" - took me about 5 mins with Vzw rep to have my phone SIM unlocked.  This means, even though it is a CDMA phone here in US, when I travel overseas, I can just pop in a pre-paid GSM SIM card from that country without having to pay for roaming fees(this makes a truly world phone for me).  I did test with my buddy's AT&T;, T-Mo simcard to make test calls/txts and it worked flawlessly.**I'm not saying other phones aren't capable of these things.  I'm just stating some things that I like doing on/about the storm.With few more OS updates and upcoming Apps store in March, I would never trade this for any other phone that are currently out in the market.  (Bberry Bold & Curve 8900 would be an exception, but then again, AT&T; & T-MO really can't compare to network coverage and Quality of Verizon in my area)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001HN5BPS" id="B001HN5BPS-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2009-11-16:</strong> I've had my Storm for a year now, and have been debating whether to upgrade to the new Storm2 or the Motorola Droid. I had the opportunity to play with both phones, and I can confidently say that the Storm is the true winner! I like the fact that you can touch the screen but need to actually "click" down on the screen to open an app --whereas on the droid it opened whatever my fingers accidentally touched, and had stuff opening all over the place just from handling the phone!  The touch keypad is much more accurate (and I had less mistakes) on the Storm than on the droid. I also like that the Storm, now a year after its release, has become MUCH more stable due to consistent operating system upgrades. The new OS is much faster and more reliable. The camera and video camera work great, I have 16GB of photos & songs on the media card - which play as good as (if not better than) an ipod, there are TONS of apps and games, and the Bluetooth sync'd to my car is awesome! I also like how everything is organized much better, and easier to find (in logical places and menus)- which I could not find in the droid. I also use my Storm as an MP3 player and a radio when outside thanks to the Slacker Radio app and my Bluetooth headphone! Apps that I have installed on my Storm are: a GPS app that is very cool and works w/ the Blackberry Maps; a Level app that turns the Storm into a level tool; a Flashlight app to use the phone as a flashlight; a task reminder app; Bartender app; Photo paint app; a Travel/Pedometer app; Weather app; Unit convert app; YouTube, and of course Facebook. In playing with the new Storm2, the only thing I can say is it is a little bit faster, has more app memory than the Storm1, and has wi-fi. I believe that the Storm2 with wi-fi will really speed up the browser.  I think I will be upgrading to the new Storm2 rather than the flakey droid that I had the opportunity to play with. If you want the best, go with the Storm!!!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001HN5BPS" id="B001HN5BPS-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2009-01-26:</strong> There are good and bad things about the Blackberry Storm.

You don't have to worry about breaking this when you throw it in your pocket.Micro USB standard charger - this means a lot of your electronics will use the same charger.The internet is fast, if you can deal with the touch screen.Jim Halpert is featured on the commercials!  Big tuna.Cons:I've used the iPhone and the LG Dare, so I know touch screen phones.  The Storm is a nightmare to text on.The touch screen clicking takes a bit to get used to.  I didn't like it, although I'm sure some will.  When I highlight an application, I expect it to open...I don't expect to have to highlight something, THEN click it again.No built in internal memory - you'll need to pick up a micro SD card if you want to put videos or music on there.The screen isn't as impressive looking as either it's touch screen counterpart the iPhone or it's AT&T; brother, the Bold.The bottom line is - if you can get used to the touch screen, this will be a fine phone for you.  I didn't like the touch screen, so most of the features didn't do what I needed them to.  This phone is just too young - wait for the next version.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001HN5BPS" id="B001HN5BPS-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2009-10-22:</strong> This is the best, most useful phone I have ever encountered overall.First of all, while I always prefer a phone with a real, rather than virtual QWERTY keyboard, the click-touch interface at least gives a tactile response to the user.  This interface also helps distinguish between merely selecting (highlighting) something and commanding an execution.  One of the great things about this interface is that it uses the type of contact used in the IPhone, where the device recognizes you with a mere laying of your finger onto the screen.  Having previously used a Voyager which requires a physical push of the screen to recognize anything, this electrical type of interface is much easier.  Unlike the push touchscreens which have a hard time discerning between merely selecting and executing a command, the fact that Research in Motion added a clickable aspect to the screen makes entering commands easier and more clear.  By the way, even the IPhone can have that problem as it has to recognize a mere placement or swipe of the screen (highlighting) and a tap (executing a command). There are those who feel that the clickable screen slows down texting.  Yes, that will be true compared to a real QWERTY or the IPhone's keyboards, but less mistakes will be made on this virtual keyboard.  When selecting a link on a web page, for instance, you merely slide your finger over the screen until you get to the link you wish to click on, then push down with a click and you're where you want to go.Speaking of the browser, it's quite quick (The new IPhone also has a WiFi option, which IS really quick, and that's what you're using when you're in an Apple store.).  On top of that, there's something pretty great with the Storm I have not seen on other phones (just to say that I may not be aware of any, not that there aren't).  You can set the internet browser to appear to the web page you land on as either a Blackberry mobile device or appear to the page as either a Firefox or Internet Explorer browser.  Why is this important?  Some sights work better with Internet Explorer or Firefox browsers.  Sometimes, you don't want to get the webpage's mobile site.  For example, The Boston Globe's mobile website,[...], is very limited.  When I go there, I usually switch from the Blackberry mobile browser to either Firefox or Internet Explorer where I can get the full website.  This phone has no problem with most full websites.  I have encountered sites where you need to put in a user name and password and find that the full browser works better.This phone has an accelerometer.  I'm not sure HOW they work, but, like the IPhone, it automatically changes its orientation depending on how you hold it. If you hold it vertically, it gives you a vertical orientation, etc.There are so many features built into the phone, including a GPS, which will map any area and provide directions, but no voice help.  For that, you can use the Verizon VZNavigator, but that's an extra charge.  The media player can play many types of music files including straight .wav files (which is the file type used on CDs, so you get the same quality sound you get from your CDs.).  Most players can only play the very compressed .mp3 files.  You don't even need special software to download files from your computer (though the Blackberry comes with a few programs to help you do this).  Simply connect the Blackberry to your computer, then drop and drag the files you want from your computer to the Blackberry drive using Windows Explorer.The phone can multi-task.  There is a task manager, which allows you to switch between open applications without closing them.The screen itself is pretty spectacular and the phone comes with a preview to a film just to show you how much it's capable of.  While most downloaded files are not of great quality, I have streamed .mp4s and they show up quite sharp.The built in 3.2mp camera is sharp, but not spectacular.  It's color correction is not adjusted as well as it could be, but overall it ain't bad.  There is a built-in flash.There are lots and lots of applications now available for the Storm, and they take advantage of the power and screen quality of the device, including a dedicated YouTube interface.  There is a Prodigy for Blackberry.  This was really Blackberry's attempts at rivaling the IPhone for sure.  Someone said to me that this is an IPhone for business people.Here's the downside to the phone and it's why I haven't given it 5 stars.  The documentation for users stinks.  A lot of this capability I only found through  trial and error or talking with either Verizon's own Blackberry service (they have a separate group that handles Blackberry only) and Blackberry's own people.  Comparing Verizon's literature that came with the Voyager and other phones I have used which talked about the littlest minutiae, Blackberry's documentation leaves a lot to be desired.  Thank goodness I'm pretty intuitive in this area and I know to poke around.  Still, there are things I would have liked to know from the documentation that are fairly basic.I'll cite just a few examples:You like that one can drop and drag files directly into the Blackberry Storm by using Windows Explorer?  Nothing in the documentation on that.  I found discovered this while talking to one of the RIM guys up in Canada.Want to customize your screen to eliminate icons of programs you won't use?  Or how 'bout how to customize the "desktop" of your phone?  Well, there's nothing in the documentation -- not in the booklet accompanying the phone, nor on the accompanying the CD, nor online.  I went to the Blackberry website and did a search from the front page. I put in "icon" into the search.  The only thing that came up were pages on how to create your own icons.  Again, a tech was able to explain how to do this.Third example:  When using the camera, there are several icons or numbers across the lower camera screen.  Some of them are obvious, some are curious and one, as it turns out, isn't used (the designers intially put it in and then opted not to use it, though it wasn't removed entirely).  There is NO explanation in the documentation as to what each of the icons or numbers represent.  Contrast this to the Voyager's documentation which explains each and every button and visual.  No stone unturned in that documentation.  Yes, the flash can be turned on automatic mode, off mode or forced mode, but is there anything that mentions this?  No.4th example:  That wonderful feature allowing you to switch browser-type I mention above?  I only learned about this by talking to one of the techs when I was having trouble working on a website.  Again, there is nothing in the accompanying documentation about this.So, there is a myriad of ways to customize the phone in terms of its functionality (not so much visually).  Most of these are found by using the Blackberry's menu button.  Unfortunately, some things you want to alter may need to be altered while in the application and others from the home screen.  You'll have to learn which are which strictly through trial and error.Contrast this to the IPhone.  Apple has mastered user intuitiveness.  The IPhone's interface is so obvious, at least to me.  I hardly needed to know the phone to know how to use it and how to get where I wanted to go.  The IPhone does have an open platform so many designers are coming up with apps for it.  The interface is quite elegant.  The home screen is simple and then drilling down is intuitive.But I can download files of all types and attach them in emails using the Blackberry.  An Apple rep told me that someone is working on a application which will allow downloading of files and attachment to emails.  When that happens, I'll consider it.  And while Blackberry's monthly fee is higher than Verizon's, it comes with unlimited data AND video and picture messaging, and I believe, the fee is less than AT&Ts; monthly fee.Bottom line here -- the Storm is INCREDIBLY capable.  The user interface just isn't as elegant or intuitive for the non-computer type users.  If you can be patient, and will to make a few phone calls to the techs (Clearly, they value Blackberry users business, as you get right through, no waits and all from US call centers.), once you have learned the quirks (the learning curve on this is much higher than on the IPhone), it's a wonderful and very useful phone.  The up and coming Storm 2 will apparently include WiFi (useful), but may not have the click screen (I, personally, would miss this feature, but I understand it can slow down the person who is a fast text message wiz.).I'm curious about the new Droid phone Verizon is touting.  I stick with Verizon.  Everyone I know who has tried AT&T; has not been the happiest with the quality of the reception they get when in the US.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001HN5BPS" id="B001HN5BPS-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2009-04-28:</strong> As merely a cell phone, the Storm would be mediocre at best. In fact, my prior LG clamshell phone was a better phone in terms of handling, use and overall experience. But the Storm was not designed to be merely a phone, and I didn't buy it for that purpose. The Storm is a multimedia device, and after having the phone for three weeks now, I can say that I had my doubts, but am now satisfied and intend to keep the phone. I did my homework on new phones and went with the Storm once the Blackberry App World received glowing reviews within days of its launch on April 1, 2009. There is a learning curve with the Storm, but once you learn how the device works, it can be a useful and functional computer in your pocket. Many reviews complain about how buggy and slow the phone can be (and prior models and OS were apparently), but I have learned that the key to optimum performance for the Storm is managing the application memory. Close all applications properly, do an occasional battery pull (or get a free app to simulate one) and learn a few other tricks and you can have a wide-range multimedia device on a network faster than AT&T.; Pandora is now available for free through the App World, which, as a music lover, is worth quite a bit to me. Not to mention the ability to take pictures with the Storm's 3.2 mp camera and upload them on my Flickr account within seconds. Like I said - a multimedia device.The instruction manual Verizon provides with the phone is virtually useless for anyone vaguely familiar with how a Blackberry works. But with an investment of time online at [...] and a few other sites you too can unleash the Storm's full potential. This is a strong touchscreen debut for RIM and the Storm will only get better with time (may I suggest a trackball/touchscreen combination).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001HN5BPS" id="B001HN5BPS-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2008-11-28:</strong> If you have been researching this phone you are likely to have come across a lot of negitive reviews comparing it to the iPhone. I must admit that if Verizon had the iPhone I might have chosen it over this (at least until RIM releases a software patch or two). But as it is AT&T; service is horrible, so the iPhone os not an option for me and those who prefer Verizon's service. If you want to stay with Verizon this is a great phone. Let me give a run down of its pros and cons.PROS:-It has great reception (the most important feature seeing as its a phone).-Its a touch screen, which can be a pro or con depending on whether you can get used to a touch screen or not.-Decent internet speed, even indoors.-Good MP3 and video playing capabilities, on par with the iPhone I tried.-A great camera as far as phones go. Obviously not a replacement for a stand alone camera, but no phone camera is.-Unlike my old Curve you can use the built in GPS without paying for VZNavigator.-Bright, clear screen that is much better looking than the iPhone I tried.-Sleek look.-Its a Blackberry, previous and current BB users will find a lot of familier features here.-Does not require iTunes, but it supports it if you wish to use it.CONS:-Its slow. It often freezes while doing the simplest things like turning or switching menus. On the bright side this seems like it could be fixed with a software upgrade.-Its a touch screen, which can be a pro or con depending on whether you can get used to a touch screen or not.-Like the iPhone (and any other touchscreen phone), the on screen keyboard can take some getting used to. In this case the SureType feature in particular.-Typicall early adobter syndrom. If you buy this you know that it is likely an improved version will be released in a year or two. Also as of right now accessories are hard to come by along with apps taylored to the Storm (luckely most Blackberry aps work on it). The last two issues will likely dissapear when the stores stock more accessories and the App Store launches next year (along with more 3rd parties supporting the Storm).All in all I'd say if you want a an iPhone, without switching to AT&T; and their lousy service you won't regret getting a Storm. I love it, and its likely to only get better through software updates. As for the price its basically $30 or $45 (depending on whether you need/want corperate e-mail or not) on top of your regular Voice plan charges, as is the case with all Blackberry devices.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001HN5BPS" id="B001HN5BPS-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2009-07-10:</strong> I just bought this phone after the keys kept sticking on my Curve. I had read all the bad reviews and decided to try it anyway--with Verizon you have 30 days to try it and return if you don't like.  I have to say I love this phone!  Right out the box from Verizon it had the older OS on it, even though the rep told me was up to date.  No big deal, took me 30 minutes or less to download .148, the new OS.  I have seen none of the lag problems that people complain about.  The camera takes awesome pics, and the larger screen is crystal clear.  I am already getting better with the touch screen.  My brother has the iPhone and said even on that it took him a few weeks to get used to typing on it.  Would I consider the iPhone if my work email was compatible?  Maybe.

Don't waste your money!!!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001HN5BPS" id="B001HN5BPS-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2008-12-14:</strong> UPDATED 12/15I just so happen to love it.  But that's because I'm open minded about these types of things.  Was the thing overhyped?  Probably.  But so what?  Methinks too many people get their hopes up and expect the world when they should understand by now that NO technology is ever perfect.First of all, to those that wonder if BlackBerry has lost its touch (no pun intended), wonder no more.  Internally this is a BlackBerry, through and through.  The only real distinction between this and other BlackBerries is the screen/navigation, period.  It's still the champion of email and messages; still handles documents, still handles PDFs, still is one of the best all around communication devices there is.  In fact, behind the the pretty interface, the apps are nearly identical to that found on the Curve or Pearl.As you've likely noticed already, this device has been getting either lauded...or blasted...depending on who you talk to.  Some reviewers love it, some hate it.  99% of reviews compare it to iPhone (AT&T;), simply because of the touch screens and accelerometer.  But to be truthfully frank, that's really where the similarities end, and is the background of my review here, as I've not used an iPhone and therefore make no comparisons.  I did own an iPod Touch for about a day (returned it, couldn't stand it), so I'm familiar with some of the touch functionality found there, but ultimately I didn't get the BB for its touch; I got it because it's a BlackBerry.  If you're in the same boat, read on.As I mentioned, this has all of the functionality of the other BlackBerries.  Email on the go is the #1 feature for me and the reason I keep coming back to BlackBerry, and this one is just as good as the others, if not better.  Of notable mention is the new method of navigation on this phone; there's no scroll wheel, no "pearl" to scroll through options.  There are two ways to navigate: touch, and click.  Touch selects an option (referred to as "highlighting"), which click activates it.  This is important, because it means you can't use touch to type.  You have to use click for each key.  Some don't really care for this. Part of that is RIM's fault, because of the way they presented this functionality.  They made it seem as though the screen was some sort of soft press deal that "felt" like keys...when really it's a single dimple pressing a single button to activate whatever option is highlighted.  You can hopefully see where I'm going with this and why I said it that way.Sometimes you'll highlight an option not what you want, thinking you're on something else, and when you click, it will do the option you didn't want.  So for example, you'll be on a menu option attempting to close an application, and it does "Switch Application" instead.  You'll see "Close" clearly highlighted, but it does the other one.  You didn't see where the highlight shifted at the last minute.  It happens.  The reason this happens is due to the user and the adjustment period to getting used to the device.  You really need to take your time and pay attention to what's being selected; it's not like other BlackBerries where you can feel out certain options, or like some users who can select options with their eyes closed because they're just that good at the navigation.  It's just a learning curve, but one that not everyone will tolerate.I had a co-worker ask me what kind of person would enjoy this device.  It's hard to say.  What I know for certain is that if you're not a "gadget head", you probably won't like it.  If you're the kind of person who just needs to make calls this is not the device for you.  That's not to say it's not good at making and receiving calls, because it is...better than most other phones I've had.  It's just that, if that's all you care to do, this phone is overkill.  Same for the Sidekick/LG Voyager/Dare converts; in my opinion, this phone is way overkill.What some have to understand, is that BlackBerries are business phones.  They are designed for the business-minded individuals who need to get stuff done.  Certainly RIM has gone out of its way to "consumerize" the device, but at the end of the day, it's not going to have a stellar, if any, camera.  It's not going to be the ultimate media player.  It's not going to be the ultimate instant messaging machine.  But it will get stuff done efficiently.Another co-worker approached me after having bought the Storm, on the verge of returning it due to multiple frustrations with using the device.  His #1 complaint: too confusing how to figure out how to do everything.  I countered this by explaining that the main difference between iPhone and Storm is that the iPhone wants to hold your hand through the process.  It wants to "teach" you how to use it effectively.  The Storm, on the other hand, is still a BlackBerry at heart.  BlackBerries don't "teach".  They expect you to know how to do the basics already.  This can be considered a shortcoming on RIM's part, but to their credit they do run you through a setup the first time to try and help you learn the basics; quite honestly, you'll only learn by doing it and patiently working with the phone.Another concern people have, and have had since the Pearl, is with SureType, complaining that it's difficult to use.  SureType is actually more intelligent than the regular phone predictive text engines; What some miss, and the reason they get frustrated with it, is that SureType is also attempting to think for you.  There are a lot of things it will do for you without you even realizing it.  Basic things such as punctuation, first letter capitalization, etc. are all done by SureType automatically.  The best way to use SureType: don't think too hard about what's going on the screen; just spell out the words, space, period.  Repeat that, without worrying about what's happening on screen (for the most part).  If you let SureType handle the logic behind the sentence structure, you'll probably find that it's even easier to manage than standard QWERTY, even though QWERTY does some of the same things.  If you think/worry too hard about what SureType is doing, it's guaranteed to give you errors, because you're effectively fighting the engine without even realizing it.Finally, make sure you update your phone to the latest firmware as soon as you get it, as it will resolve a lot of the issues with the screen navigation and accelerometer.  Other than that there isn't really much else I can say.  Either you will like it, or you won't.  The more open-minded you are about the phone, the better the experience.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001HN5BPS" id="B001HN5BPS-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2008-12-16:</strong> I have had this phone for around a week.

Fact is that Blackberry still reigns in the business world. As intrigued as I am by the iPhone and the huge application offering, the Storm is still king in the smartphone arena. I won't give up my iPod touch anytime soon though!I've had a couple Blackberry products, so by no means am I new convert to Blackberrys. I upgraded to the Storm and received it the Saturday after released. Friends waited in line on release day for many hours, and in all honesty, it only ended up being 12-16 hours later that I got mine from Fed-Ex by the time they made it out of the stores.Out of the box, the operating system (OS) was by no means stunning. It is a good looking phone though! Shortly after the release and the problems of typing and rotation issues, the beta OS'es were hitting the web. These made for HUGE improvements in the functionality of the phone. The downside is that RIM/Verizon is SLOW to release an approved version. The current release is still .75 which fixed all the initial huge problems. All phones are delivered with .75 today. I just completed the installation of .141 this morning, which is rumored (aren't they all?) to be what will be the next official release. I have my doubts, but it is huge improvement over many of the previous beta releases I was running.The memory leaks are FINALLY gone (went away for me with .132). I am running with ~40mb of free memory, and it stays there! Before I moved to the previous beta release of .132 I had to reboot the phone daily because of memory leaks. The upgrade to .142 gave me about 8mb additional free memory.A pointer like box was added in recent beta releases which makes corrections much easier when composing an email.As strange as it may sound, typing has been consistently getting better with the OS updates. I didn't think that this would be possible, thought it was a problem with the implementation of the touch screen.A nice drop in dash mount for my leather Piehl case has also allowed me to replace my Garmin GPS. I chose the Verizon Navigation software as it is discounted through my corporate discount plan, and most importantly traffic is offered in my area. The Garmin BB software didn't offer a manual route around detours which was a problem where there isn't traffic coverage and you are notified of a road closure.The application offering is ever expanding, my favorite of which is Pandora. That replaced my Sirius subscription, and best of all, it is free.The camera isn't half bad for a cell phone, this again has been improved with newer beta releases. Geotagged pictures are pretty neat as I have a pro Flickr account which has built in integration to the phone.&lt;update 5-13-09>I downgraded from the 142 release, and since installed a Hybrid OS running leaked version 141 and a beta of the upcoming 5.0 base OS update. We're in for big things. The 5.0 Bold platform browser which is coming to the Storm is a huge leap forward. The browser is SO much faster under 5.0.Memory utilization is vastly improved as well. I hang in the mid 40mb free range. Mind you the OS shipped on the phone will be less than 10mb and require daily reboots (battery pull unless you get an application-free to do a true reset).Version 141 was rumored to be the next official VZW approved release OS, but it didn't pass QA. I do have a Bluetooth stack issue under 141 where BT cuts out from my S9 headphones after every song. It does the same thing when connected to Bluetooth in my car.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001HN5BPS" id="B001HN5BPS-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2009-02-23:</strong> BlackBerry Storm is like a beautiful woman with a personality disorder: It will charm you with its gorgeous screen but make your life difficult with slow & buggy software that constantly freezes!

You have to go through several menus and taps to do simple things for example you have to go through two screens and taps to put phone in vibrate mode.4.Voice quality inferior than Palm Treo 755p but better than iPhone.5.Poor desktop sync software. On Mac it either syncs contacts & calendar with PocketMac; or the media with iTunes with MediaSync- not both. And once you install MediaSync, you cannot use PocketMac!6.Only syncs playlists, not Podcasts.7.Unable to play audiobooks from Audible.com, as of February 2009.8.Does not fast forward or reverse audio or video.9.Long shutter lag with camera and even though it is supposed to be 3.2 megapixel, picture quality is not very good.10.No Wi-Fi.11.Fairly heavy at 155 gm and not easily pocketable like Palm Centro.12.Bluetooth plays stereo but constantly disconnects.13. Accelerometer very sensitive, keeps changing keyboard from portrait to landscape and vice versa even when you do not want to.BlackBerry Storm replaced my Palm Treo 755p which I really liked except for its bulk, browser and lack of Wi-Fi. I was hoping to replace  2 devices - Treo 755p &  iPod - with Storm but its software is buggy & sluggish and voice quality poor compared to Palm Treo 755p; and media player does not sync Podcasts and play as well as iPod.

The problem is that it is nearly impossible not to touch a nearby key on the keyboard and that slows one down considerably.  I've tried, I really wanted this phone to be great given all the features, but can't stand it.  Also, if you want to use the keyboard, you have to go to menu, scroll down (should be a top menu choice) and then select "Show keyboard."  That's an annoyance after being used to having a keyboard (a real one) right on the device.  When entering information into a field on a webpage, the keyboard does automatically come up.  But you have to tap exactly into the field data entry box on the page (good luck in doing that; you can magnify the page but then have to demagnify the page to view it after entering your text).  Just too user unfriendly and an enormous missed opportunity by RIM to create something great.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B001HN5BPS', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B001HN5BPS', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B007UOKQJO</h2>    <p class="price"> $B007UOKQJO</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007UOKQJO" id="B007UOKQJO-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-18:</strong> Bought these for my iPhone and people compliment them all the time!

I know now that if It was sent like my other iphone accessories items were the shipping would have been longer , on with it ..

They stay on, in fact, it's near impossible to take them off. They don't make the home button hard to press or anything, and they'll get a lot of comments from people who think that it's more than a sticker. Haha. The only problem I had was, once you take a sticker off, if left a thick sticky residue on my home screen button that was difficult to remove. I had to take off my screen protector and repeatedly press it on my home button to get the residue off. Lucky I had another screen protector sitting around.If you plan on keeping one sticker on your phone for a long time, these are the ones to get. It you plan on putting one on then taking it off soon after, then probably not the ones for you, because of the residue.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007UOKQJO" id="B007UOKQJO-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-17:</strong> Everybody likes these.

These things rock. The clear sheet isn't quite the size of the screen on the X which is actually good in a way. I'm sure if they were exactly the size of the glass, it would be much more difficult to install. There's about an 16th of an inch gap if that. Make sure you are in a room with ample light so that you can get the phone screen really clean using reflections as your guide.These things aren't that hard to figure out. The side with the tab to pull off BEFORE application has a little bit of sticky on it obviously. I recommend NOT pulling the first strip completely off but doing what other reviewers have said and sliding it about halfway down, then using the supplied "squeegee" to get it flat on your screen. One thing, I was glad there were three in the pack. I cleaned my screen off with the non-stick cloth and then used the first one to actually pick up more dust and invisible particles. This worked really well. The second one I used is actually on the phone right now and the third acts as a backup.Overall, if you have a little patience, these things work awesome. There is NO WAY you should spend anymore than a buck on these things. I highly DO NOT RECOMMEND the higher priced ones available.PROS: EVERYTHING.CONS: NOTHING.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003X57XB8" id="B003X57XB8-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-01:</strong> Great screen protector. protect my phone from dirt and sand.

I was hesitant because so many people said it took them several tries to install them and they didn't come with instructions. Well the second part is true, they don't come with instructions because they don't need instructions. A monkey could put these on. Like all screen protectors they have a protective backing on each side of the 'real' screen protector. There are pull tabs to remove the clear backing from the screen protector and they are labeled with a '1' and '2'. Now I don't know, maybe I'm just a genius, but it would seem to me that is self explanatory. You simply remove the backing that has the '1' on it first, duh, and discard it. Then you stick the side that you just removed the first backing piece from face down to the screen. Then you smooth out the bubbles. Second, you pull the tab labeled '2' (what a coincidence) and voila. You're left with a nice crystal clear new screen protector. If that doesn't make since then perhaps the big words printed on the tab that state "remove this first, and remove this last' will help. I read that some people were complaining about the sticky residue being left behind after they removed the labeled stickers from the backing. Well, that's because the pieces that are labeled are to be thrown away. They are not part of the screen protector! They are simply protecting the real screen protector until you put them on. This is a very simple task and anyone over 4 years old that doesn't still pee themselves should be able to do it. These protectors are very nice and cover the entire screen. You get three in a pack for under a dollar so buy some extra's.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003X57XB8" id="B003X57XB8-review19" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-18:</strong> This product arrived on time and was incredibly easy to install.

Application was very easy compared to others. I applied it and put it in my purse in a separate compartment. I took it out and boom! there was a big old scratch mark on it. It didn't go through the protector, and therefore did protect my screen, although I doubt whatever it was(I think it was my fake nail) that scratched the plastic  would have actually marred my screen, but nevertheless, it provided it's service for it's price.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003X57XB8" id="B003X57XB8-review42" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-07-06:</strong> I decided to replace the original Verizon matte, non-glare protector that I'd had on the phone since I got it almost 2 years ago.

The colors are more vivid, and everything is more crisp.  It's easy to apply.  Really, it is.  There were no bubbles and no trapped dust particles.  It's not like I'm some kind of professional screen protector applier either!  There's a protective sheet on each side of the actual screen protector.  Just peel off part of the one that says to remove it first and line up the protector.  Peel the rest off as you apply it to the phone.

Before buying these I read some bad reviews.  Yes, Screen protectors can be a little tricky but all I did was clean my DroidX screen with a little windex, then I used the supplied micro fiber cloth to further remove dust.  I started at the bottom of the phone and slowly let the screen almost suck up the protector.  It went on very smoothly with no air bubbles.  Now, I did have one little bubble, I wouldn't call it an air bubble because while inspecting it in the glare of a light I noticed an extremely small dust particle right in the middle of it.  Fortunately, it was on the edge and was covered by the phone hard case.  So, make sure there is NO dust on the phone before trying to apply the protector.  This is only the second time I've applied a protector and other then the one tiny dust particle issue it went on perfectly.  Oh, and the fit was perfect too.

I interpret this as a sign of what is to come through normal use.  The product is cheap enough, so no big loss to try it.  I did get a couple bubbles under it.  Upon close inspection I can see that it was because of tiny pieces of lint.  I cleaned the phone several times with a lint free cloth before installing, but it's pretty difficult to not have ANY lint on something I guess [at least in my house :-) ].

Whomever did the cutouts for the speaker/camera and the home button were either on drugs or 6 years old.  Because the speaker/camera cutout is way, way, way off-center.  (On the iPhone, it is perfectly centered).  If you center the screen protector perfectly, the cutout is very large and still manages to avoid the speaker and camera.  But it looks terrible.  Way off center and obviously so.  Huge fail.

It is a wired headset in the form of a telephone handset. It has one button to answer and end calls. Like the single button on Bluetooth and wired headsets it can redial the last number, activate voice dialing if your phone supports these features. On the one hand it takes the place of a $15 wired headset which often comes with your mobile phone. On the other hand it is a very comfortable phone to hold against your head, the audio is as good or better than your phone's, it looks great, is passively powered, and looks great ( I said that twice). Setting aside another reviewers xenophobic bashing of the french, the adapter works with all iPhone, and 3.5mm iphone like 3 band headset plugs. If you have a phone with a proprietary adapter,Native union sells a bunch of adapters or you can get one from any local best buy, radio shack etc. as most phones have converters from proprietary to the 3.5mm standard. You can use the phone with or without the base. The base if fairly heavy and stays put on your desk.

I have room on my desk at work for the base and the pad for the iPhone is a nice bonus. I don't like how this feels to use "hands free" balancing it on your shoulder with your neck and head.

I had to figure out why I ordered it and if I made a mistake, so I set out to give it a try.  Opening the Amazon box yields a swanky and well designed package that's sure to impress any gift recipient.  More significantly, its easy open/close velcro top and window proudly say, go ahead open me up, check me out, and I dare you to return me (as opposed to piranha-like clamshells which just scare you into keeping crap).  Anyway, it never was returned.  Here's what you get:You get all that is promised, a corded handset (no Bluetooth here and it's a handset not a headset) for a cell phone, a weighted base (which I believe you can get by without if you'd like), and a somewhat useless silicone pad for your cell phone.  That's it.  The genius is in the execution, and  quality exudes from the design and the workmanship.  I actually rather like the humble handset, and I imagine it'll be something that others who have forsaken landlines will grow to love too.  If you're concerned about radiation, the lack of Bluetooth will certainly be a plus, and the longish cord can allow desktop users to keep the cell phone away from other desktop items such as their PC (which can hinder reception).  Lastly, the audio quality rocks.  Without Bluetooth issues to worry about, it does have a head start, but the microphone and speaker are also top notch.  I already got unsolicited compliments on my first call (maybe my old headset was that bad!).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003DKL4MC" id="B003DKL4MC-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-08-08:</strong> Synopsis:  The Moshi certainly puts distance between one's head and cell phone radiation.  However, it does so at the expense of convenience; reducing the cell phone to the status of an old school corded telephone.Cell phones emit low levels radiation during calls.  We humans, especially children, absorb at least some of that radiation as we talk on our phones.  Many smart persons believe this radiation absorption is potentially very harmful to the health of cell phone users.  Other smart persons, along with the cell phone industry, do not associate ill health effects with the type of radio frequency radiation cell phones emit.  For those who wish to play it safe by avoiding the radiation, altogether, the Moshi Moshi offers a simple alternative to head sets, ear pieces, and hands free devices.  By plugging one's phone into the handset base and using the rather old fashioned hand set, one can keep the radiation emitting cell phone well away from one's ear.  The Moshi does this well.The Moshi, though, does take some getting used to.  To get the most out of it, one must unholster or unpurse one's phone and set it close to the handset base in order to plug it into the base.  The Moshi ships with a soft, rubbery, grippy phone rest which adequately holds protects the phone and table surface upon which it sets.  This means one has to "run" to answer the phone instead of just reaching for it.  On top of that, unless you manage you hold the handset and your cell phone, you will be unable to wander while speaking as if you had returned to the pre-cordless phone days.  The convenience factor of the cell phone, therefore, diminishes.And then there is the styling.  Out of the box, this unit fails to impress.  Co-workers who saw me using it agreed is rather unattractive looking.There must be a better way to protect cell phone users from radiation.

Leather case, with soft felt interior.  Looks well constructed, and snaps on securely.Could not really give it a 5 star rating for a couple of reasons:1) the case on precludes being able to put the iPhone on her Bose Sound Dock without having to remove the case, and to do this is rather difficult. - this is only a minor inconvenience.2) the cover flap does not flip completely out of the way (as in some other cases where they are "hinged" to the back of the case.  In this design, the "hinge" is to the front bottom, and so the front flap tends to sit at an angle and often makes contact with her chin or mouth when speaking.  The front flap has a metal piece that slots into the back case, and allows for its removal, but then it would defeat the purpose of protecting the front glass if you remove this piece.  Also, where the front cover leather goes into the metal connector plate may prove to be a weak point ~ as other reviewers have mentioned the leather breaking at this connection point.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005XG3EKO" id="B005XG3EKO-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-02:</strong> Merchandise arrived damaged.

Unfortunately, that was YESTERDAY, and her case has already broken. The metal (?) latch that connects the cover completely fell apart, making the cover unusable (the whole point is to cover/protect the screen of her iPhone).  Mine is still intact; HOWEVER I have noticed the little suede tabs that connect to the cover latch are very thin and stretching, so I imagine they might tear, OR the latch may fall apart as my Mom's just did. The good thing about this case is that you can charge your iPhone with the cover in place, using your Apple/USB cord. BEWARE though, if you have to remove the case or it's cover for any reason (like to place the phone on a charging stand or if you are one of those people who switch covers like purses)) chances are this lovely case won't last you very long. I have no beef with the seller- the item arrived very fast and was well packed. I think this case is designed for SHOW, not true protection or durability.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005XG3EKO" id="B005XG3EKO-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-03-16:</strong> This is one of the most beautiful iphone cases.

It has its limitations, however &#8211; recharging only by solar is very slow and can take several hours to build up a decent charge level. But if you don&#8217;t have access to power, such as while camping or in an emergency situation, any ability to recharge can be hugely helpful.The overall build quality seems very good. It has a good heft to it, and it is encased in a water resistant frame that is also shock resistant. The input and output ports are covered with rubber flaps to keep out dust and moisture. I really like that the flaps are attached to the body to prevent me from losing them.The overall size is pretty compact. It&#8217;s just shy of 3 inches wide and about 5.5 inches long. It&#8217;s very thin (about  inch thick) making it pretty convenient to take along in a backpack or even a large pocket. It comes with a clip ring so you can hang it on a strap on a backpack.The output ports (2 of them) are located on the top on either side, and provide a 1A output. There&#8217;s also a micro USB input port for conventional recharging. It has a 4 LED &#8220;gas gauge&#8221; to show the power level remaining.No complaints at all regarding performance. It recharged my phone and mp3 player without a problem, and still had about 50% capacity remaining. The 5000mAh capacity means this is best for small devices but, in a pinch, you can also use it for a larger device, such as a tablet, albeit the charge speed will be slow and you probably won't be able to fully recharge the device before the powerbank is empty.While it&#8217;s priced higher than a conventional powerbank of the same size, the solar recharge option makes this a better choice if you&#8217;re looking for something that can be carried along for camping or hiking, and still maintain the ability to recharge it even when there&#8217;s no power.[Sample provided for review]</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00KMRYSQ8" id="B00KMRYSQ8-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-24:</strong> I like the way that my charger looks - the blue is a pretty light blue that matches several of my other phone accessories.  It comes with a 10 inch cable (not including the ports) and an adapter that you can use to make the USB mini-port turn into a USB to I-phone adapter.  I put it in the window and it charged up , to full, a little green light came on and when I plugged it into my Kindle, all 4 blue indicator lights came on and it charged my Kindle completely as fast as if I'd plugged it into the wall.The solar panel looks durable and nice - it's not shiny and cheap looking like some are- it's more matte and it's tight without a lot of cracks so it is rain-resistant.  This is actually the first solar cell I've seen out of a material that is matte like this - I like it a lot.  Most are shiny and a bit static-y and attract dust, this one doesn't.It comes with a hook so you can hook it on a backpack or purse.  It has 2 usb ports and a mini-port in in case you want to charge it with the wall.  I've only used the solar charge so I can't say how it works on AC.There's also a small LED flashlight.  It's not big, but it's helpful to find keys or unlock a door in the dark.  To turn it on, just tape the power button twice.  It turns off the same way.I was given a sample for purposes of review.  I do like and would highly recommend it.  It's very stylish and pretty, and it absolutely does what it is advertised to do, easily without any effort- just put it in the light, and it charges and works.  It's very simple.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00KMRYSQ8" id="B00KMRYSQ8-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-01:</strong> This charger provides emergency solar charging when no other power source is available. The approximately 5.5 by 3 inch device is a 5000 mAh portable battery that is normally charged using its micro USB port and the included cable connected to any full size USB power port. It will take 5 to 7 hours to achieve a full charge in this manner, with the four blue LED lights showing progress in 25% increments. Once fully charged, the device can fully charge two USB devices at the same time using the two USB ports, one on each side of the handle. It charged my almost fully depleted iPod 5 in just over a half hour and showed 50% capacity remaining.There is a single green LED to indicate when the battery is charging from sunlight, which goes off when complete. When solar charging is used to recharge the battery, the matte finish solar panel that covers the front of the unit only generates 200 mAh which is about a 1/20th of what a normal USB connection would provide (4000 mAh), so it would take several days in the sun to achieve a full charge from a complete discharge. The solar capability provides an important backup lacking in conventional auxiliary battery devices.I actually had an occasion when I needed to make a call and found that both my phone and battery pack were out of juice. With this product, you can be sure that it will never be completely discharged by giving it time in the sun each day, and even if it is completely discharged, a little sunlight will get you enough charge to make a phone call. Don't leave it in a closed car in direct sunlight, however, because it will not work in temperatures over 113 degrees Fahrenheit (45 degrees Celsius).Along with its emergency solar capability, the charger has an attractive rubbery liner surrounding the solar pane l and covering the back. The USB ports are concealed behind rubbery hatches and contribute to making the device dust and water resistant. There is a small oval opening in the rounded top in which the included carabineer can be attached for ease of transport. The charger has a smart combination of handy features -- handsome, powerful, lightweight, water, dust resistant, compact, and rugged.A power cord is included (USB-A to micro USB) and an adapter was provided to fit iPhone 4/4S phones.

Mine arrived close to one hundred percent charged, so I was able to at least test the simultaneous charging capability by connecting my Galaxy Note 3 phone and Tab 3 10.1 tablet. Both were in the ninety percent charged range and both were at one hundred percent in less than thirty minutes.Of course, the key feature is the ability to recharge the 5000mAh battery in this unit using solar energy. After I discharged the battery to about fifty percent (indicated by two remaining lit LEDs) I tested that capability. Even on a slightly overcast day it took about ten hours to charge it up the remaining fifty percent. Not bad to be honest.There is a charging port that allows you to more quickly charge this from a wall or car charger. That process can take five to seven hours, but it's a major convenience when you are preparing for camping or otherwise going off the grid.Some of the features that impress me about this battery is it's designed to be water and shock proof. More importantly, the status lights show at a glance the capacity (in twenty-five percent increments), and the charging state from either solar or wall power sources. For me it's reassuring to see the light indicating that the unit is, in fact, charging up via solar.I will not say that it's indestructible, but it's definitely sturdy and will withstand a lot of abuse in a harsh environment. For that reason, and because it works per claims made in the product description, I am giving it five solid stars. It's in my vehicle as an emergency item just in case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00KMRYSQ8" id="B00KMRYSQ8-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-08:</strong> I took the eBoot solar charger power bank with me on a week long camping trip.  Our cabin was devoid of electricity, so I relied on this power bank.  Instructions note that the solar charging is just for emergencies, that it should not be left in the sun for prolonged periods of time.  I had to wonder what a consumer would expect buying a solar charging power bank if it weren't to be be left in the sun.  How long is too long?  So, I left it out to charge.  Seeing that the battery level was not moving up above one bar, I did what any normal person who doesn't read instructions would do and left it out all day, every day.  After a full day of bathing in the sun (sometimes shaded by trees but I tried to move it to full sun when I saw that), the power bank has enough juice to give my HTC One a 10% charge.I've had experience with larger solar chargers, so I didn't expect much more, though I did hope for it.  Even three and four panel fold-up chargers take a bit of time to fully charge a 5000 mAh power bank.  This power bank is the size of a large cell phone.  There just isn't enough surface area to catch the solar energy.  Instead, we can charge this power bank with a USB cable, which is what I do most of the time.  When it's fully charged, I can give my HTC One a 100% charge.This is a rugged power bank.  The ports are covered, and there's a carabiner for hanging off a backpack.  It's good for camping, but don't rely on the solar panel.  If you have an emergency and wait all day, you can get enough power from the sun to charge your phone, search for a signal and call for help.This product was provided for review by eBoot.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00KMRYSQ8', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00KMRYSQ8', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00HKSCJ22</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00HKSCJ22</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HKSCJ22" id="B00HKSCJ22-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-24:</strong> I was provided a Pawtec Apple Lightning Cable for testing and review and was asked only to give my honest review, so this is what I found.What You Should Know Before You Buy:&#9830; Passed the "Does it Work" Test with flying colors.&#9830; MFI certified to work with all Apple Lightning Devices.&#9830; Was able to sync and charge my iPhone 5S with no problems whatsoever.&#9830; It is a high quality cable with solid connections from wire to plug on both ends.&#9830; The Lightning plug end is larger than the standard Apple Lightning cable plug and could have problems fitting into some cases, but it fit my Incipio Dual PRO case perfectly.Conclusion:Overall, the Pawtec Apple Lightning Cable was great.

With the traditional black cable skin coating it's as flexible like any other, but what makes this stand out is the orange rubberized grips.You really can't go wrong with this cable especially when the original Apple brand costs about $8 dollars more. The cable by Pawtec provides the same transfer and data speed as the original for those who are primarily concerned about its true purpose. Although, it does exactly what it should in comparison, the most unfortunate thing about this cable is that the ends are on the slightly thicker side.So depending on whatever protective case you are using on your device, the Pawtec Charge and Sync Cable may be a little too fat to plug in all the way in to your device's charging port. Also, because the ends are orange and rubberized, they may scratch and discolor depending on how much you intend to use it, but other than that, I personally think it's a perfectly fine and stylish cable and great option for those who are on a budget for Apple products.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HKSCJ22" id="B00HKSCJ22-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-15:</strong> You pay a little more than generics for this, but it is cheaper than Apple, and seems better made.

In the last year, I've seen several third-party brands that appeared to be of equal quality as Apple accessories. The Pawtec Lightning cable meets or exceeds the quality of other cables that I've seen and used. The plugs and the section where the cable meets the plug end look to be well made and very durable. The hard rubber-like plug where the Lightning end goes into the iPhone or iPad is 0.45&#34; wide, which should fit through most cases. The 3-foot length (I measured it as 39&#34;) allows enough freedom of motion to move the phone or tablet around, which is essential if you're in a vehicle with your phone charging from a power port.This is an excellent cable, and it's considerably less expensive than buying the official Apple cable.A product sample was provided for review purposes.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HKSCJ22" id="B00HKSCJ22-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-10:</strong> This is a great charging cable for any of your iDevices that require a new lightning cable.  First, you will notice that unlike many other off-brand cables, this one is MFi certified, so you know that the lightning connector is high quality.  I connected it to my iPad 4, my iPhone 5S, and my iPod Nano.  All of them charged just fine and sync'd just fine with my PC.  The connector on the end looks well fabricated and I did not detect any play or stiffness when plugging it in.The other charging cables I own are the OEM cable from Apple and the AmazonBasics cable.  Compared to the OEM cable, this one is thicker and less flexible. The lightning connector on the end is also a little fatter which may make it a tight fit in some bulkier iPhone cases.  In fact, it almost wouldn't plug into my AmazonBasics case, but it did manage to fit.  That being said, the AmazonBasics lightning cable has an even thicker shroud and had a tougher time fitting.So I give this a strong 4 stars.  Not as flexible or thin as the OEM cable, and certainly the larger plastic shroud is a bit annoying, but it feels high quality, works well, and is certified for use with your Apple devices.  At a lower price, what's not to love?Note: I received this cable as a sample from the manufacturer in exchange for an honest review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HKSCJ22" id="B00HKSCJ22-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-04:</strong> This cable is more stiff than the original.

Look no further.  I bought this unit with the matching transmitter ("Sony Bluetooth Wirleless Transmitter for iPod (Black)"), and have been enjoying clear, reliable music ever since.  This headset has a volume adjustment that actually works -- the upper volume range is amazing.  The track-changing controls are also snappy (just flick to change).  The unit pairs quite well with its own transmitter.Bluetooth is not great for deep sounds, so the bottom range is just okay.  But the overall sound is better than any competing products.One recommendation that I am surprised no one has considered: an on-off switch that, once flipped on, automatically pairs without having to hold buttons down.  All bluettoth headsets are guilty of this gaffe.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B000PCCLPA" id="B000PCCLPA-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2009-01-21:</strong> These stereo headphones are IMHO a miracle of modern electronics. (OK, maybe I'm somewhat easily impressed) I'm using them with my Samsung U900 flip shot with a 4 gig. chip..A word of caution: Your phone (or other storage device) MUST! support A2DP(Advanced Audio Distribution Profile)  and AVRCP (Audio/Video Remote Control Profile) to access all the features of this device. (or for that matter, to even work with it)..I have most of my CD collection in my phone and when listening to music the buttons ON THE HEADSET will control (in the phone) fast forward, rewind, mute, move to next song, pause, and play, even  turns off the phone speaker when active. The head set is quite comfortable (at least for me). The fidelity is on par or better than plugging directly into the phone with my wired headsets. Certainly not "studio quality" ,but again, quite adequate.  Stereo separation is superb..I was initially concerned about the phone working with these headphones as the phone shows NO capabilities of sending stereo music (or ANY music) via bluetooth link prior to pairing with these headphones. To wit: to my Motorola H710. After pairing with the headset, all the functions magically developed in the phone of control by the headset..The only `Cons' I can think of are [1] No fidelity control (like bass and treble) [2] I haven't yet been able to INITIATE a call with the headset playing and consequently give voice orders to my phone..Which bring me to another `plus', however. When listening to music an incoming call is indicated by a tone from the headset and may easily be answered by pushing the `multifunction button' on the headset. Surprisingly, the music `mutes' and the headphones will then serve as a fairly good bluetooth hands free communication device. There is a mic in the rt. head piece as evidenced by a SMALL hole about 1mm in diameter. I didn't expect much of communication with this mic placement, but again: big surprise! It works quite well both ways during a call. Particularly on my end due to the fact BOTH ears are participating in the conversation. It isn't as good a bluetooth -phone communication device such as my Motorola H710 ear piece, but close..When the call is terminated, the music automatically comes off `mute' and again begins to play..It does take some practice to be able to push the desired button or control on the headset, as it must be done by `feel' alone. There are four different buttons, two being a `rocker' profile. Easily learned, even by this old man..Any multifunction device most always can be outdone (on a SINGLE function) by a dedicated, single use device on the plethora of functions sometimes available. A good example is my U900 Samsung flip-shot phone. It's a 3.0 megapixel camera, a passable video cam, a very good "MP3" (type) player, and ,before I forget, ummmm... a very good cell phone..IMHO some of the negativity expressed in many reviews neglects to consider the INHERENT lesser capabilities of a MULTI function device. Refer to my second paragraph comment(s)..Battery life is quite good. With reasonable expectations and a compatible storage device, I think most would be satisfied with these headphones.  Emphasis on WITH A COMPATABLE A2DP/AVRCP DEVICE..Addendum 5/09- I AM able to give my phone voice commands and call initiation. This is, however, the headphones weakest feature. These headphones could stand on their flawless transmission of music alone  as far as my opinion goes. The voice commands are a non-issue for me, anyway.

While there may be better,  more expensive headsets on the market,  this was about as high as I was personally willing to go for something with no swappable battery and intended for serious use.I picked this up as part of a bundle with a Bluetooth Transmitter for my iPod,  and it is serviceable there.  The real shortcoming appears to be the transmitter,  which is not particularly strong.This review is strictly about the Headphones,  however,  which are pretty close to excellent.There are certain compromises purchasing headphones;  larger,  over the ear style ones are better but heavier.  Smaller,  in-the-ear style ones tend to provide less in terms of quality audio,  and are most likely worse for your ears in general.These are  "street style,"  which may not contour to your head if you have a larger one.  Despite this short coming,  they probably provide the best balance between size and sound.  Clip-ons always fall off my hears,  and over the ear headphones block out too much noise when I am outside.  While I appreciate my music,  I appreciate not being run over much more.The sound on these headphones is particularly good compared to a similar price range.  Use with a portable media device will depend on the transmitter;  while my iPod and transmitter struggle to broadcast from my pocket,  the headphones will receive music in fine quality from as much as 30 feet away (standard distance for a Class II Bluetooth device).  Similarly,  I can stream music from my PC anywhere in my apartment.While I did not buy this primarily with phone usage in mind,  the unit's microphone is solid and the noise cancellation is some of the best I've used.  My friends usually cannot tell if I am at home or out on the streets,  barring heavy wind or a semi driving by.  Compared to the bluetooth earpieces I've used in the past,  the reception is stellar.  Not only do I no longer have to raise my voice,  I can speak in rather quiet tones.  This was a pleasant surprise,  considering this was not the reason I made my purchase.Active Battery Life easily trumps eight hours new;  over time,  expect the batteries in a bluetooth unit will deteriorate,  and most cannot be replaced.  Expect two years of battery life from such a unit,  with some deterioration towards the end (depending on use).  Standby time is a little dodgier,  and extended time off the charger may limit usage.  If I charge the unit in the morning or overnight,  I can get a full day and change,  even with heavy use.  Unfortunately,  this appears to be the only way around the drain on the battery.The headphones also support multiple devices at once.  For example,  you can run a music device and a phone through the same unit,  provided they support the right profiles.  I stream music with an A2DP profile through my iPod or PC while also using my mobile phone.  This can cause minor disruptions to the music,  however.  Interruptions are usually minimal.  The headset features controls for fast forward,  rewind,  play/pause,  volume,  and talk/end/voice dial for phones.  A compatible device can be controlled with only the headset,  meaning your phone or music player can be tucked away and still managed.The features,  sound quality,  and reliability far outstrip any problem I have with the neckband.  If your head is larger than normal,  expect the earpieces to shift around,  and possibly discomfort if worn for several hours at a time.  When not in use,  I usually let them rest around my neck instead.The type of headphones one uses is a personal choice,  but if you prefer the "street style" to clip-ons,  earbuds,  and studio/monitor style over-the-ear headphones,  this is a great device for the price.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B000PCCLPA" id="B000PCCLPA-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-05-13:</strong> It's an awesome bluetooth piece available in the line of bluetooth headsets. The sound quality is far better and louder than Motorola bluetooth I used before. I'm satisfied with my purchase. The controls on the headphone is easy to control. The operation is exactly s mentioned in its description, 11 hrs voice and music. It folds so easy to store in bag or sometimes even in my jacket pocket. I definitely recommend this to the user who wants to get rid of wires between phone and mobile.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B000PCCLPA', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B000PCCLPA', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00A20BXXG</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00A20BXXG</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A20BXXG" id="B00A20BXXG-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-30:</strong> very average cover. its cheap so its ok. i am not using it anymore because it makes it very bulky.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A20BXXG" id="B00A20BXXG-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-19:</strong> These cases are awesome.

I had one that my husband gave me after he got a new one but it wasn't very flexible and didn't let me have much movement of my head.  I saw this headset and I thought that maybe it would work better.When I first took the headset out of the box I was surprised by the short cord that was on the charger.  Most of our outlets are the typical ones that are near the floor so I have to literally place the head set on the floor when I charge it in my bedroom.  The only place that I could charge it that I wouldn't have to do this is in the kitchen which at times is very inconveniant.I have to do quite a bit of adjusting to get the earpieces to fit my ears correctly so that they do not fall out if I move my head.  I really don't know how people could use these successfully if they were running.  I have used them while I was walking and I had to limit my head movements to very little movement or the earpieces would dislodge (still better than the other headset thoughThe distance that you can be away from your device is very limited.  With the other headset I could walk almost anywhere in my house.  Not so with this headset.  I am lucky if I can walk across the room and the headset doesn't cut out on me.Once I do get the headset adjusted it is very comfortable on my ears.  The quality of the sound is quite good.Since I do most of my listening in my car this headset works well (after the Initial adjusting).  I would not recommend for any activity that has alot of movement.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FVNHBI" id="B005FVNHBI-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-28:</strong> Awesome for workouts.Battery life for music is as advertised, about 2 hours.

So far I've used them around the house and while walking.There is no in-the-ear aspect to them.  Therefore they let in external sound fine. I could hear people talk to me as I walked.  That would be important if riding a bike on the street, etc.  If you prefer ear buds, which I usually do, then you'll find that there is a lot of extra sound.Previously I had a pair of in-ear Sony bluetooth earphones that I really liked, but they would fall out.  These were more comfortable just hanging out on my ears.  I plan to use them while cooling off in the pool (without submerging them) and I needed to know they wouldn't fall off accidentally.The functionality is good and walking around suburban Houston I was able to receive my favorite FM station.  Changing stations is error prone and laborious, so these are only realistically going to be set to one station and left there.  That said, I didn't have any real problems with reception and I'm 30 minutes from the city center.My S4 worked fine in my pocket with these.  Occasionally a song would jump which may have been reception issues.  In the house I left the phone on my desk and walked around a corner before I lost signal.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FVNHBI" id="B005FVNHBI-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-01-13:</strong> I was down to this product (Jabra Sport) or the Jaybird Freedom Bluetooth headphones to wear in the gym.  I was sick of the corded headphones. I ended up with the Jaybirds, but I decided to get my wife a set of these Jabra headphones for the same purpose. I tried them out, wore them once, and returned them immediately. Glad I chose the Jaybirds in the first place.Reasons these aren't good:1. Uncomfortable. In an effort to be simple, they chose a standard piece that when inserted in the ear just hurts. I am a nearly 6-foot tall man and they hurt my ears. For a woman, it would have to hurt badly.2. Range.  I can take my Jaybirds 30 feet from my cell phone which acts as my MP3 player in the gym.  I couldn't get 3 feet with these. If you aren't wearing the device on an armband, it wouldn't work at all. I am not sure even an MP3 player laying on a treadmill rack would have uninterrupted reception.  Terrible.3. Buttons.  Not easy to press at all.  You kind of have to push through your ear to get to the buttons since they sit on the headphone arm which sits on your ear.  Very annoying.I will say I like the design and cord in the back aren't cumbersome.  Given they are similar price, the Jaybirds are far far superior.  The range is bad enough on these to stop me from owning them at all, even if there weren't a worthy competitor.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FVNHBI" id="B005FVNHBI-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-11-28:</strong> I received these as part of the Amazon Vine Reviewing Program and partnered them with myLG Optimus Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile)to test them out. The following is my impression of the Jabra Sport Bluetooth Stereo Headset, based upon experience using the following bluetooth products:Motorola H720 Bluetooth Headset [Motorola Retail Packaging] andBlueant S1 Visor Mount Bluetooth Car Kit Speakerphone with Multipoint - Retail Pack.  I also useSkullcandy Titan In Ear Bud S2TTCB-047 (Black/Chrome)headphones daily during workouts, and compare this product to the Jabra Sport for 'fit' only.PACKAGING and INSERTS:Tough to get into this one! I ended up prying it open from the top and after a lot of untaping, it was free. The Jabra Sport headset, charger, rubber earpieces and directions were included in the packaging.GETTING STARTED - DIRECTIONS:The directions that come with this product are fair. Very small insert, with small drawings for 'how to', along with written directions relating to functions.  If you are a forty-something like me who needs 'cheater' glasses to read things - get 'em ready to dive into these or have a magnifying glass handy.Jabra added two supplemental inserts: one yellow and one red so you don't miss 'em.  These too are in very small print.  I think Jabra could do better with a bigger booklet, with better images - actual photographs would help.If you have trouble with the directions, I suggest going to the Jabra website and looking up the product.  You can view a hyped video, which indicates you can easily pair these with bluetooth devices such as your tablet PC and smartphone, as well as easily answer calls and listen to the radio.  FAQ and support is available on the website as well.You will need to charge your Jabra Sport Headset prior to use. I'm not sure how long that takes as I plugged mine in as I was going to bed, but a green blinking light appeared when it was charging, no light was on once it was fully charged.The charge will last 3-4.5hrs, depending upon how you use it.  The charging port is under a rubber flap on the left earpiece. The flap feels flimsy, but if you're careful, it should be OK.  It snaps into place and is flush when properly mounted.THE PRODUCT:A good solid unit - well made and substantial. I like the design: on/off, volume, FM radio buttons all on the right earpiece with a cord behind your neck so no battling it. What I don't like and the reason for the 4 versus 5 star review - the fit of the earpieces.I'm a medium to small framed woman.  My ears are 'just right' for my size, but these Jabra Sport earpieces - after trying all three rubber tips - just don't comfortably fit my ears. I can wear the headset for about an hour without needing to remove them.  More than this and my ears actually ache.  No, I'm not shoving them in, nor am I using too big a rubber tip.  It's more about the shape of the speaker (round) and the size of it (about 2/3rds of an inch in diameter without the rubber tips).  They do block out the external noise, but I think ultimately these are made for men's ears and not women's.  I'd love to see a "women's" version with a smaller earpiece.FUNCTION:The Jabra Sport paired quickly and easily with my LG Optimus Android smartphone. It also paired with my bluetooth enabled PC the same way.  Recognized quickly with no need to add a code.  If your device needs one, it's OOOO.  A woman's voice comes on to tell you what to do to pair it, once you turn on the headset, and it's also in the Jabra Sport directions.FM radio signal pick-up was not great in my area, but I live in a rural place with few stations.  I can see how it would work well in a metropolitan area though.Listening to music off my phone using the Songbird Android App was seamless and crystal clear. Nice bass, but not stellar as the Jabra site claims - at least in my opinion. Volume control on the right earpiece is easy, but I tended to dislodge my earpiece when I pressed up or down to adjust the volume. Again, the fit of the headset for me was an issue.Turning my head, jogging with the device - neither affected the performance of it.  I did set it up as in the directions: phone on right side, above waist level and paired with device.OVERALL IMPRESSION:This would be a good product for a man - due to the fit it's tough to recommend it for women or anyone with anything resembling 'smaller' ears.  I can see where even those who are not going to use it for mountain biking, skiing, snowboarding, running and similar active pursuits could enjoy them if they fit their ears.The build-quality is excellent, and they should prove durable. While the directions are not great, they are not tough to use and the Jabra site is helpful.I like that the short cord is long enough for people with big necks (big guys will love 'em) and can simply be pulled out and hang around your neck while not in use, but don't have tons of cord length to hide or battle.I also like that there is an Android App called: Endomondo Sport Tracker (FREE- there is also a 'Pro' paid version for %3.99 in the Android Marketplace) which allows you to use the GPS in your paired device to track your workout performance.  The Jabra Sport headset pairs with Endomondo to audio-coach you through your workout - giving you pep talks.  While that could be annoying to some, I thought it was fun.The only real issue to consider when buying this one is 'will it fit'.  There is an insert that says 'Do not return to point of purchase', which leads me to wonder: "If you buy this and it doesn't fit - can you not return it?" If you have questions - I'd contact Jabra Support or Amazon prior to making this purchase - just in case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FVNHBI" id="B005FVNHBI-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-11-09:</strong> Jabra "Sport" used with HTC EVO 3DEndoMondo Sports Tracker* Intro and Inspection** Testing and Battery strength*** Optional Software--"EndoMondo Sports Tracker"**** Conclusion* I love Jabra--the Dutch company--that's been producing about a dozen or so different styles of Bluetooth-enabled headsets and headpieces a year.  The company has also managed to get the full support of the wireless community where almost all of the well-known devices are connectable with it.  And, now there are software companies producing innovative app's--lifestyle app's--that work seamlessly with your mobile phone.  The recommended, optional app--Endomondo Sports Tracker is one that I didn't realize that I needed or would feel crazy about.Jabra is, in my opinion, the most-versatile wireless accessory company out now, bar none.The set contains:The Headpiece-- two "over-the-ear" headpieces attached by a rubber band.  (I don't know if the rubber band contains a Bluetooth connector or is just a material that connects the left and right earpieces, while there'd be two Bluetooth receivers for each ear.)  In any case, the band doesn't seem to serve any purpose.  If the band is indeed to wrap around the head for support, the one size fits all doesn't work.When I first walked a 3-mile trek, the headset would come loose and I'd find myself re-adjusting as I walked and talked on the phone.  Despite the reception and the battery strength, I was all set the give "The Sport" a 4-star rating, until I took it out for a spin on a few other occasions and never had that happen again.The second night I went out, I subconsciously firmly adjusted both pieces over my ears and it molded to the shape.  I never moved from then on.  Still, the rubber band (barely noticeable) didn't seem to play any practical purpose, if there was one in fitting.The third night went just as well.After about 4.5- 5 hours of use without charging it, the battery finally went out.  A full charge came about 2 hours after being plugged in.The set also comes with micro USB ac adapter.  And, a smattering of paperwork which, to be honest is there for legal reasons and nothing else.  Once you turn on the headset's power button, the set will whisper in your ear "power on."  Making your phone "discoverable" in the Wireless & Network section causes the headpiece to say, "connected."  All of the volume and FM radio buttons are self-evident.** One of the truly great features of this product is the fact that no one who was talking with me for any length of time knew I was talking to them on a Bluetooth headset until a gust of wind came by.  Even then, they thought that I was holding the phone next to my face.  The clarity is above par.A2DP--stereo reception.  The audio fidelity was exceptional.  Although the quality of audio depends on the files that you're using and NOT the device itself, from music videos, to mp3 to my treasured Tony Robbins collection, it is better than the fidelity of Bluetooth headsets with the exception of The Bose series 2.  But, the Bose has some drawbacks.*** As I mentioned, amongst the paperwork that's included is an invitation to download the wireless app called "Endomondo Sports Tracker."  I first looked at the advertisement and quickly dismissed it as I have about 50 app's on my phone already and most I haven't looked at since I downloaded it originally.  Another app didn't seem appealing especially since my business was to test out the quality of the product.Two weeks into the playing around with The Sport, I just happened to come across the packaging for the headset when I noticed the advertisement again.  I went to the Marketplace and pulled up the app.  I quickly noticed that people who had downloaded the app was using it for a host of different things, much more than just running 100-miles in an hour.The app is important because it can serve as a visual GPS if you're walking, running, hiking, swimming or anything where you want to see where you started out and where you're at.  The stat's: heart, pace, calories etc., notwithstanding, it is the ability of the program to inform you of where your location is, how long it took to get there and the distance that really, really impressed me.  On the Endomondo site, you also have a twitter-like feed where you can see other people from around the world using the app in real time to mark their progress.****Since bluetooth-- the application, itself-- is notorious for draining battery power from the headset AND the phone, I'd recommend for this device (since you're going to be using it primarily outdoors and perhaps for hours at a time), this would be handy to keep nearby...Energizer Energi To Go Mini & Micro USB Tips Cel2musbConsidering everything, from the $70 price tag, to comfort to fidelity to working with 3rd party app's for your Android or Iphone, the Jabra "Sport" is definitely a must-have.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FVNHBI" id="B005FVNHBI-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-10-26:</strong> I typically don't like this style of earphones; I have small ears and this style that usually applies pressure to my ear canalHeadphones feature a convenient in-line remote that gives me full control of my iPhone.

The basic reasons for my satisfaction are as follows: The headset sound quality is very good, the product is easy to pair, they fit comfortably and securely in and around the ears, it has a decent battery life and is easy to recharge, it comes with a soft rubber covering for rain, dust and shock protection, has a built-in FM radio that sounds good, and the sound doesn't cut out (although my usage has been primarily indoors. However, be aware that some other reviewers have experienced some cut-out issues when exercising outdoors.)While I wouldn't consider the following factors to be a deal-breaker by any means, I think simple modifications in these areas would make the product even better than it is and, thus, worthy of a five star rating: Providing a little longer charging cord, enabling the sound volume to be a little louder, and making the rubber-like wire attached to each bud a little longer so that the buds won't be tugged when you move your head during exercise.All in all, the Jabra Sport is well-worth considering when you want a high quality bluetooth headset.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FVNHBI" id="B005FVNHBI-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-07-14:</strong> I don't necessarily dislike this product.  For what it is, I think it's decent and in some areas, very good.  Here's what I liked and what I didn't like.Likes:1. Pairing was relatively easy.2. Seems to be well made.3. Audio quality when playing music or *listening* to a phone call is very good.4. Relatively comfortable if you don't wear glasses.Dislikes:1. Audio quality when speaking to others via the built-in microphone is poor.  I was told that I sounded "muffled" as if "I had food in my mouth" and I was asked to "change phones".2. Design interferes with my eyeglasses.  Can I wear them with my eyeglasses?  Yes, although it's not terribly comfortable and makes  my glasses sit higher on my head than usual.  But I'm constantly aware of my glasses' frames pushed and crowded together with the earpieces of the Jabra unit.  I don't recommend this product if you wear glasses.3. Poor FM stereo sensitivity.  I am in inland San Diego about 17 minutes from downtown.  I cannot pick up a single station.  It might work fine in the heart of the city, but I'm not that far from the city's center and I can't receive anything.4. Hard to find the buttons by touch.  Hard to remember which button does what.  Maybe if I used it a lot I'd remember.  But usually, I have to just randomly push and hold down the different buttons until it ultimately does what I (maybe) want it to).5. Act of using buttons hurts my ears.  Your ears are fairly sensitive and just the physical force needed to push on the buttons is physically uncomfortable to my ears.  Maybe you have less sensitive ears?Conclusion: Again, this is not a bad product.  For some, it may be a very good solution.  The biggest plus is the sound quality, which is above average.  But I found them a pain to use and I don't recommend this item for those who wear glasses, like me.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FVNHBI" id="B005FVNHBI-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-28:</strong> I tried two or three other &#34;SPORT&#34; headsets and this Jabra is the only one that's held up.

I was able to hear audio from videos on Youtube or through the browser. The audio quality is great. It was crystal clear and had good bass. Audio quality from the FM radio from the Jabra wasn't all that great but at least you get radio. What I really liked about the set was being able to activate Siri. Just press and hold and Siri gets activated. As far as comfort it took me a while to get used to it. I always wore in ear head phones. These were a new thing for my ears and now I can say that they are pretty comfy. I wish the yellow band was about 2 to 3 inches longer. That way I can take the headset off and let them hang from my neck. Overall these are pretty good. I use them to walk my son in his stroller in the park.

I'm going to retest the Bluetooth on the off chance that it was my phone that was having issues, not the headset.  Figured it was the fair thing to do.Where the yellow cable meets the earpieces seems like they ought to have more re-enforcement.  I've tried all the included detachable ear pieces, and they all are nice, pending your own preference.  However, they come off way too easily, though once they are on/in your ear everything is ok.Sound is light on bass, clear and crisp.  Controls are easy to manage while running, even with sweaty fingers.  They let a lot of sound in and out, so to hear your track you may have to turn up the volume above say 85% on both your devices volume & the headset.  I worry about the volume level in this regard.Pairing is decent, nothing to report.  The range on the Bluetooth is bad though.  While running with iPhone5 in hand, it cuts out repeatedly.  In an armband there seems to be no issue.They stay nice and snug on the ear when used, and do not chaff.For the price and the brand name, I expected better.

If I completely maintain line of sight, between the headphones and my phone, they sound just as good as most wired headphones if not better.  Until they drop out for unexplained reasons - sometimes, not always.  If I put my phone in my carpenter pants leg pocket they cut in and out when they can get connected at all.  I've carried this phone and the two previous ones in this pocket by default for several years running.  It's the reason I buy carpenter pants nearly exclusively now.By comparison I've forgotten my phone in the car at the gas pump with my Jawbone Prime in my ear.  I've done that and gotten calls while in the gas station and taken the calls.  Maybe a little static and a couple of cut outs, but I can stay on the call until I get back in the car.  That's at least the glass in my vehicle, the glass in the gas station and 30ish feet.  These things wont reach from my leg to my ear.  It doesn't even improve all that much when I put my phone in my rarely present shirt pocket.You're supposed to be able to talk on these as well as listen.  I'm not going to complain they don't measure up to my Jawbone in noise cancellation, that's expecting way too much.  I'm going to complain that I'm better off putting my phone on speaker and shouting at it from 10ft away than I am trying to talk on this unit.  Even in a quiet environment people on the other side of the call have difficulty understanding me through these headphones.One nice advantage these have that my Jawbone Prime doesn't, I can voice command my phone with them.  It's practically useless due to the above mentioned poor mic quality, but it does work - sometimes.  When I'm in an absolutely quiet environment, say at home with the door shut when I can actually use my hands anyways, it does a half way decent job allowing me to voice command my phone.  I could see this being infinitely useful were they half as good as my Jawbone on sound reception.I have experience doing stereo Bluetooth from my phone already, I have CyFi stereo Bluetooth speakers I use on my bike.  My CyFi speakers do not connect as well as my Jawbone does, but they still connect better than these Jabra headphones.  I will say the Jabra headphones sound better than my CyFi speakers do, but I don't use them on my bike for safety reasons, and the can't reach from my pocket to my ear reasons.These really aren't worth putting your money into.  For me it was worth the money I spent buying them to get my phone fixed, but I would have felt seriously screwed had I payed the asking price for these things with their poor Bluetooth performance.  Unless you ONLY intend to use an arm strap like they guy in the picture above, or ONLY intend to use them while your music device is nipple level or above and close otherwise and you don't actually want to carry out two way conversations on them, by all means get them.  Otherwise I don't even consider the product properly "working".For reference the rest of the hardware I'm comparing these to/using with them:Jawbone Prime Bluetooth Headset (Coffee Talk Brown)Cy-Fi Wireless Sports Speaker for Bluetooth (Red)HTC Evo 4g.

Everything I wrote above is true, with my Evo 4G and my laptops I had some serious connection issues, despite these devices working great with everything I've thrown at them.  However, now that I have an Evo 4G LTE all those other items work great with the new phone and so do these things.  I walked 25 ft from my phone with metal storage cabinets between me and the phone the other day with music playing and it sounded great the whole time - but it still has trouble going between my pocket and ear.I'm guessing these things don't support older Bluetooth standards well.  My computers use various versions my my LTE Evo supports 4.0 Bluetooth, while the older WiMax model supports Bluetooth 2.0 + EDR.  Just crappy 2.0 versions?</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FVNHBI" id="B005FVNHBI-review19" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-17:</strong> I got this bluetooth headset for my gym sessions as normal headphones fall out and a cord running to my phone gets in the way when lifting; however, when they first arrived the headset barely lasted through half of my workout before the battery would die, after a couple weeks and a few emails (didn't have time to call) they shipped me a new pair that definitely lasted longer but still not nearly as long as I would like them to. I can get though about a two hour workout but if I want to do cardio afterwards it will be without music. The bluetooth connectivity is extremely spotty and unless your phone is placed entirely in the open the connection goes in and out, they are even spotty when my phone is in my pocket. The sound quality is okay, nothing special they don't get too loud I can still hear everyone at the gym with them turned all the way up but that isn't too big of a deal. Overall they work for their purpose but they could be much better for the seemingly high price.EDIT:So after going through one pair and needing a replacement I now am being shipped a third pair. Luckily within a year of purchase because of the year long warranty. The second pair was working fine for about 8 months and all of a sudden my left headphone went out completely. Not sure what caused it but it was random and sudden, possibly sweat. Anyways they are shipping me a new one without incident but it would be nicer to have them be flawlessly working. If this third pair breaks after I am out of warranty my gym buddy just got a pair of JayBirds that he loves that sound a lot better and have better connectivity to my phone. They are much pricier but I believe you get what you pay for.

This one has worked fine over the past two months, so now I am increasing my rating to three stars. If it works fine for at least a year I'll bump it up to four stars again.***** Update to the Original Review: November 7th 2011 ****After just two weeks of use this headset started acting up. The indicator light turned purple, and for a while I was unable to completely turn it on. (For some reason the FM radio still worked fine). Eventually I get it to work and pair up with my iPhone again, but all controls seem to be out of whack and there is no consistent performance at all. I will try to contact the customer service about this, but for the time being I cannot recommend anyone to buy this headset and have lowered the rating to two stars.***** Original Review *****I have been a big fan of Bluetooth stereo headsets ever since the first ones appeared several years ago. At the time I had been pairing them with cell phones with mp3 players, which seem to be light years away from today's smartphones. The Bluetooth headsets are ideal for workouts: compact, unobtrusive, and very functional. I have gone through at least fiveMOTOROKR S9andMotoROKR S9-HDheadsets all of which shared one common major shortcoming: they were not sweat-proof and inevitably stopped working after less than a year of use. Because of this I have been considering completely swearing off Bluetooth headsets in the gym, but I decided to give these Jabra headphones a chance. My first impression is fairly positive, but for me the true acid test will be how well they deal with sweat over an extended period of time.I also already ownJabra SPORT corded Stereo Sports Headset, so I am able to compare the corded vs. cordless version of this product. Overall they are fairly similar, with the corded ones having a slightly better sound quality and the Bluetooth one having a better fit.**** Sound Quality ****Unfortunately the sound quality is one of the weaker aspects of this headset. The sound is very tinny and hissy, especially with the high notes. I am not exactly an audiophile, but I was extremely disappointed with the sound quality of this headset. It is passable (barely) for the workout use, but I would definitely not use these headphones to listen to the music on other occasions.**** Design ****Unlike the sound quality, I was very impressed with the design of this headset. It is fairly minimalistic with the "functional" area of the headset confined to the immediate vicinity of the ears, and with a very thin and unobtrusive cord that connects the two halves. I do wish that the cord had a different color (yellow is not exactly the epitome of coolness), but this is not a major issue. Thanks to the kind of design that these headphones utilize it is possible to fold them and put them in almost any pocket or a bag. I just wish that the headset came with a carrying case like its corded cousin.**** Fit ****Fit is another feature that left me pleasantly surprised. Most cordless mono headsets are fairly loose on your ear, so I was expecting something akin to that experience with what are essentially two mono headsets connected with a cable. The actual experience couldn't have been further from my expectation. These headphones accomplish an almost impossible task: they fit very snuggly without either pinching your ears or putting too much pressure on your head. It could be that the size and shape of my ears makes them particularly suitable for this headset, but my guess is that most people would find them a fairly good fit.**** Wireless Range ****This is one of the weakest characteristics of all Bluetooth sport stereo headsets. The range is fairly good - if you are indoors and/or have a direct line of sight with the headset. I've been able to use them under such conditions across a decent sized room. However, if you are outdoors and put your mp3 player in pants pocket opposite to the side of your antenna (that would be the right hand side), then your reception will be intermittent at best. I usually use this headset in the gym, so this is not so much of an issue for me, but when I go out I try to put the mp3 player in a shirt or jacket pocket. That usually works just fine.**** Telephony ****I've used them to make several phone calls, across the regular phone lines and via VOIP, and in all situations this headset performed quite well. If you are listening to music when you receive a phone call it will automatically switch to the phone.**** FM Radio ****This is a really neat and unique feature of these headphones, and I have gotten to use it quite a bit. The reception is fairly good, especially if you are outdoors. If you want to go for a run or a walk and don't necessarily want to bring your mp3 player/smartphone along, then this feature will allow you to still enjoy some music. However, you will be unable to manually choose your radio station without the headset going through all of the available ones first.**** Audio Prompts ****Unlike the other Bluetooth headsets that I've used, this headset gives you voice prompts when you do all major function changes, such as turning it on/off, or switching between phone and mp3 player. This is very useful because you will be able to clearly know when any one of these events takes place.**** Battery Life ****I've been able to use these headphones for well over three hours, mostly listening to music but also making a brief phone call. This again is on par with other wireless headphones that I've used. Before the battery runs out you will hear repeated warnings of "low battery". At first I appreciated being told what is going on better than if I had to deal with an annoying beeping sounds, but after a while the incessant repetition (that only got more frequent as the battery kept losing its charge) really got to me. In a way this might be a good thing if you are procrastinating about charging the headphones, but if you just want to use them for as long as possible before you have to recharge then you'll definitely feel annoyed. On my iPhone I also get a small headphones power level icon next to the Bluetooth icon, and this helps you gauge how much battery power you have left. If you go to the gym three times a week for an hour or so, then you can get away with charging these headphones once a week. For a more frequent gym attendee, or for someone who uses these headphones for some other daily routine, then I would recommend charging them more or less each day.**** The Charger ****This is one of the most frustrating and disappointing features of these headphones. The headphones are charged using a micro-USB cord, but the charger's cord is extremely short (about five inches). This means that unless you have a power strip on your desk you will need to charge the headphones by essentially putting them on the ground. Fortunately I've discovered that Kindle's charger also works with these headphones, so I've been using that one instead.**** The Packaging ****These headphones come in a cool and sophisticated looking oval package. The package resembles a can more than a box, and conveys a very modern and dynamic look. However, the packaging is was not very intuitive to open, but once I figured it out it was extremely easy to do.**** For iPhone 4S Users ****I've managed to launch Siri directly from this headset by pressing and holding the play button slightly longer than fro the play function, but not as long as for the on/off function. This is a neat feature that will let you use Siri even when your iPhone is slightly out of reach.**** Conclusion ****Overall, I am fairly pleased with this headset despite its few serious shortcomings. I hope that the headset is truly sweat-proof, and that the future versions will address some of the above issues.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FVNHBI" id="B005FVNHBI-review23" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-07:</strong> These function really well, fit great, last for a good period of time without charging.

I can leave my phone downstairs and they will work if I go upstairs. The Jabra seems to require line-of-sight or it cuts out.When running, once I break into a sweat they tend to slip off my ear. I'm managing this by pinning them with a headband.I do like the little headset battery level indicator on the iPhone. I wish other brands had that.As I said, they're basically "OK".

So I'm always looking to try a new pair of Bluetooth headphones.These however, has to be among the worst headphones I have ever ownedI've broken down the pros and cons to explain why:Pro:Wireless: no cords to break, has allowed them to last for several months (4 months so far).Survived the squish test:  I stepped on them with my shoes on, on a hardwood floor (not intentionally).  The housing popped open, but they still worked.  Plus for them.Cons:Wireless Range:  The range on these headphones is hideously poor.  They lose reception if your mp3 player is in a pants pocket on your left side (this happens constantly to me as I am a lefty).  They lose reception if your mp3 player is in your right pants pocket and you put your arm in front of your pocket.  They lose reception constantly when you are outside...  I can't imagine working out with them, outdoors if your mp3 player or phone weren't strapped to your right arm.Sound:  The high sound is fine as is the middle range, but the bass is very poor.  Additionally volume is rather low, toping out at half the volume I can get with wired headphones.Battery life:  Battery life on a full charge is simply awful, coming in at around 2 hours.  More than enough for a work out, but not enough for a long bike ride, hike, day at work, car trip, or just about anything else.  In addition you cannot use them plugged in (they turn off when plugged in).  So you may need to carry another pair of headphones for backup while they charge.Comfort: I found all the included inserts to be moderately uncomfortable, but the plain circles to be the best.  However, the circles kept popping off the headphones when I would charge them.  It wasn't long before I lost them and the headphones without them actually cut into your ears.Controls:  How much harder would it have been to include an extra set of controls for fast-forward/rewind, why force us to learn a volume managed control? And why make this control different than the in-line control on the corded version of these headphones? (which I also own).  Additionally, why place the controls in such a way that you are essentially pressing down on your ear to turn up the volume or fast-forward.  Your head is a solid bone and a good thing to press against... your ear is not.Conclusion:Unless you're desperate for wireless workout headphones, and you already own an armband, I'd skip these.  There are much better Bluetooth offerings out there.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FVNHBI" id="B005FVNHBI-review26" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-25:</strong> The Jabra Sport paired great with my iPhone 5, it also kept it's connection for a good distance (20feet or so) unlike many who have complained about it. It is very rugged and I really like the cord in the back instead of the fixed connection like the Moto SD10 where it becomes very unconformable to wear. The Jabra Sport feels so so to wear over an extended period of time and does not move once you've found the correct gels (it comes with three fittings).The sound is not the best, very tinny, hardly any bass to speak of but if you are into working out a lot (Mountain Biking for me) the sound is "ok" to get you through your paces of the workout.Overall an ok device but Jabra needs to improve on the sound significantly.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FVNHBI" id="B005FVNHBI-review27" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-12-07:</strong> I have a couple of different Jabra Stone bluetooth (blueteeth?) that work great with my blackberry.So when this became available I was excited.The excitement quickly left me though. . .When used with an armband device, it seemed to work fine for my workout.But the second I moved the device into the pocket or even in my hand while running it cut in-and-out. Really? Darn!If you aren't running around, then it works a lot better. Wasn't this meant for exercise and movement? Well, poor marketing.Battery lasted a couple of hours, not the 4 or so advertised. Darn again!!I did not have any problem setting it up and it fit well with my ears without fear of falling out. Thus an extra star!Now on the note of falling out, the material the band is made up tends to catch on one's neck and pulls the headphones right out. . .when exercising.

Some Bluetooth, some corded. These are definitely my favorite. Only two complaints I have is volume and battery. I've gotten to where I just charge it every time I come back from a run. Not a big deal. Other Bluetooth sets have lasted weeks between charges, but these have run out of battery a twice on me because I went more than 1-2 runs without charging.I've mostly been using this inside on a treadmill. I attempted to use these while mowing the lawn the other day and it would not hold the connection even though my iPhone was on an armband literally 6 inches from the headset. I'll do some more testing running outdoors when the weather cools off and may update my review if the connection problems persist.  Indoors though, they're amazing.  I would use no other headset for indoor workouts.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FVNHBI" id="B005FVNHBI-review31" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-10-30:</strong> Nice looking pair of Bluetooth earphones, check. Dust, water, and shock resistant, check. Well, they claim it's up to military standards. Will check up on that later, see how it stands up to workout abuse.Sounds good, with clear treble and sufficient bass. I wish it had more sound isolation, though - if working out on a gym, you may have to turn up the volume - and you probably don't want anything too loud too close to your ears for a long time. I would have preferred an in-ear earbud design.It's got a mic for answering the phone, done by "tapping" the on/off-play/pause-pairing multifunction button. Although its not quite "tapping" ...You see, the controls are protected by the external rubber layer, which makes it slightly difficult to "tap" or press, but not overly difficult - just takes getting used to, and you'll have to press against your ear lobe to get the volume and FM buttons to activate - thumb on button against index finger/ear.The charging port (mini USB) is protected by a little rubber or plastic cover. The connector between the ear sets looks like a flat yellow noodle, which presumably gives it some strength.Most functions are confirmed with a voice notification, such as pairing or powering off or on. Nice feature.The FM seeks by holding the volume buttons in the desired direction for a second or two. I wish there was a voice prompt to tell me what the frequency is, or an app that interfaces to show me or let me set it.Speaking of apps, it interfaces with a fitness app called Endomondo. The free version has a bunch of features, such as tracking your running route and setting a distance goal. The paid version ($3.99) lets you set time or calorie goals. You'll need to buy another gadget for heartrate tracking. You're supposed to hear updates on your progress, but during 5 minutes of walking I didn't hear anything. The app says it'll say something after each lap, so I'm not sure how that works for non-lap activities. I'll be trying this out again later.Complaints? Well, as mentioned, more sound isolation would have been nice. Seeing or hearing the FM frequency would be nice.If you want this form factor in a sporty, rugged package, and can be careful not to blast your eardrums in noisy environments, this seems to be a good package. If you want more noise isolation, though, I would take a look atJaybird JF3MB Freedom Stereo Bluetooth Earbuds with Secure Fit-Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Midnight Black. Although it looks iffy re: staying in your ear. Another contender isMotorola 89553N SF600 Wireless Sports Headphones - Retail Packaging - Blackwhich has better soundproofing (maybe 60%) but seem more blocky than these.UPDATE: you really want more sound isolation than these offer.

The headset came pre-charged, so you can start using it right away. Pairing it was a breeze, I only need to glance through the pictures provided in the manual. For pairing, you need to wear the left ear piece to listen to the instruction. Hold down the answer button on the right earpiece and a voice guides you the rest of the way. Nothing to it. Repeat this same procedure for the second device. The headset sounds awesome! Probably the best sounding bluetooth headset I ever had. i have not tried answer the phone with it as it is late at night so can't say how well it works. Will update after I have a chance to use this function. The headset looks well protected, covered with soft rubber so I don't think I would have problem under a light rain. They fit on my ears just right and also come with several attachments to fir different size of ears.The charging cord that comes with the headset is a bit short, I wish it is a couple of foot longer! The cover of the charging port is kind of a flimsy rubber, it helps if you have long finger nail! I am not sure how long it will last with my big finger trying to pry it open!I connected the headset to both my iPhone and iPad, and they sound wonderful. It gets interesting when I played a song on both devices at the same time. There was stutttering and I can barely hear from either devices, Well not practical, but I tried it anyway.Overall, for the price this is a really good buy. I am no audiophile so I can only tell you it sounds awesome and I love it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FVNHBI" id="B005FVNHBI-review33" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-10-31:</strong> These are just what I have been looking for. In the search for the perfect bluetooth stereo headset, I had previously been using Motorola S10-HD Bluetooth Stereo Headphones, which were uncomfortable after extended wear. The Jabra SPORT Bluetooth Headset is comfortable, has excellent stereo sound, has a good background noise filter for phone calls, and is incredibly easy to use.I had my SPORT headset synced up to myT-Mobile myTouch Slide 4G Android Phonelistening and controlling Google Music within a minute of opening the box. The headset has voice prompts helping the user sync up and know if the device is connected to a phone. Ear buds and headphones don't tend to fit my headshape well; but the flexible wire connecting the two pieces is a simple and effective at fitting a wide-variety of headshapes, something my S10-HD was not. From the right ear bud, one can pause, play, control volume, advance tracks, answer calls, and listen to FM radio. The controls were pretty easy to learn and control without looking after about a day of fumbling.Battery life is my one complaint. I have been getting 3-4 hours of life out of them on a single charge. I would like to just leave them on throughout the day even while at my desk and use them to listen to music and answer calls, but they die too quickly when listening to music for that function. The good thing is that they charge on a micro USB which seem to be ubiquitous now. So they are easy to charge.I have not had the problems that other reviewers have had with dropped bluetooth connection while keeping the phone in my pocket that other reviewers have had. So I'm not sure if it is a problem inherent with their phones or the SPORT device.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FVNHBI" id="B005FVNHBI-review34" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-13:</strong> After three months of faithful usage, I have come to the conclusion that the Jabra SPORT Bluetooth Stereo Headset is a type of Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde product.  The Jabra performs smoothly and effortlessly when I use it INSIDE my apartment, the clubhouse, automobile, etc.; however, when I take it OUTSIDE, my walking and jogging excursions become frustrating, nerve-wracking, stressful experiences that make me want to destroy the Jabra.The Jabra is definitely worth having if you plan on wearing it INDOORS on a regular basis.  For example, I've worn it while operating the exercise equipment at my apartment's clubhouse.  (My favorite is the elliptical trainer because it produces less strain on my arthritic knees than the treadmill or stationary bicycle.)  Without cumbersome wires, I feel so much freer to move.  However, you must be careful not to walk away from a machine and forget your iPod/iPhone.  Someone coming up from behind you to use a machine could steal it.I enjoy wearing the Jabra INSIDE my apartment while cleaning, cooking, dancing and kickboxing.  It's like having a portable docking station that I can simply move from room to room.  I can walk approximately twenty to thirty feet away from my Apple iPhone 4 and still have great reception.  However, when I move to a different room, the walls interfere with signal transmission, thus producing static.  My solution is to simply move my iPhone to the next room where I will be cleaning, exercising, etc.I've worn my Jabra and listened to music while driving my Saturn to and from work at the shipyard in downtown Portsmouth.  The music sounds superb (better than a wired headset) inside the confines of my compact automobile.  However, you must know the laws where you live.  In some places, wearing headsets while driving is illegal.One day, I sat my iPhone on the kitchen's microwave and listened/watched Final Destination 5 while preparing a large meal.  My Jabra made it easy to move around the kitchen while enjoying the movie I had downloaded to my Flixster app.  It would've been impossible to accomplish this with a wired headset.The Jabra is horrible for OUTSIDE use.  I've tried wearing it and listening to music from my iPhone while walking or jogging with little success.  First of all, I can't wear the Jabra comfortably when I'm also wearing sunglasses.  When I turn my neck, the headset falls away from either my left or right ear.  The music stutters, stalls, hesitates, falters or ceases altogether and the Jabra's computerized female voice will announce, "Disconnected."  I've tried wearing the iPhone on my arm as depicted in the illustrated Quick Start Manual but this didn't help.  Strapping your iPhone to your arm is nearly impossible during the cold months when one has to wear a jacket or coat.Speaking of illustrated instructions, the Quick Start Manual has a few illustrations that one must interpret followed by a few lines of abbreviated instructions.  These are presented in three other languages besides English.  The other manual isn't much better.  At first, it seems thick and comprehensive until one realizes that this manual contains instructions that are also provided in three other languages.However, there is a toll free 1-800 number that you can call for technical support.  (It is found on the back of the Quick Start Manual.)  I called this number when I came home from Christmas and had difficulty, for some unknown reason, pairing my Jabra with my iPhone.  The gentleman at Jabra was very patient, understanding and helpful.Initially, it was difficult for me to wear the Jabra and to turn the power on and off.  Here are some simple tips I learned after wearing this headset for two months.  The yellow strap goes behind your neck and the controls are on the right ear in order to allow easy operation with the right hand.  Always pair the iPhone with the Jabra by picking up the iPhone and selecting Settings/General/Bluetooth On.  Begin wearing the Jabra headset, press its On/Off button and hold it until the computerized female voice says "Power On" and "Connected."The Jabra's computerized voice will always provide the wearer with helpful announcements such as "Power On," "Power Off," "Connected," "Disconnected" and "Low Battery."  When you are finished wearing the Jabra, go to iPhone and select Bluetooth Off and the computer will announce "Disconnected."  Then press the Jabra's On/Off button until the computer announces "Power Off."  In this way, one doesn't have to worry about the Jabra's rechargeable battery being needlessly drained while it is not being worn.Speaking of the battery, the computer will begin announcing "Low Battery" when the battery needs recharging.  She will continue announcing "Low Battery" with increasing frequency until the battery is completely drained.  She will finally announce "Power Off" and the Jabra will become dead.  It takes two hours to fully recharge.  The flashing green light will turn a steady green when the process has been completed.  The manual warns not to overcharge the battery or it will decrease its lifespan.  In other words, don't let it recharge overnight like some people do when they are recharging other electronic items.  Ensuring that the battery isn't recharged for more than two hours can be cumbersome.Also, the Jabra doesn't seem to stay charged for as long as the packaging informs you.  Seldom do I use it for making/receiving telephone calls; mostly I use it for listening to music while cleaning, exercising and cooking.  The battery has to be recharged after approximately ninety minutes of usage.  I could never wear it the entire ten hours I am driving home to visit my parents.  A gym rat who works out a lot would have to keep it charged on a regular basis.The Jabra has three sets of interchangeable "Ultimate Comfort Eargels."  From my personal experience with wearing numerous headsets, I found that the replaceable ear cushions, whether they are manufactured of foam, gel, etc., have a tendency to come off and get lost after a few months of constant usage.  I prefer headsets with permanent, one-size-fits-all ear buds such as the wired headset that came with my Apple iPhone 4.The only good thing about using the Jabra outdoors is that the FM radio works well.  Press the FM button and use the volume control to move up and down along the FM stations.  Stop when you find a station you enjoy.  Also, there is a free endomondo app that can be easily downloaded to the iPhone, which I did.  It keeps track of how many miles you jog or run.  This is awesome to use when running on an indoor track at a health club.I only recommend the Jabra SPORT Bluetooth Stereo Headset for someone who plans to use it INDOORS on a regular basis such at a health club or in a personal home gym.  It is too much of a hassle to wear outdoors.  Also, the more often you use it, the more often the battery is going to need recharging.  I recommend that you determine what activity or activities for which you need a headset and list the pros and cons of wearing the cordless headset versus wearing the wired headset.  Do the advantages of wearing a wireless headset outweigh its hassles?Joseph B.

They fit his ears perfectly and he says they are very comfortable even for long periods of time. If you have the right size ears, these are definitely a worthwhile product not only for sport use but for general use as there isn't much competition out there in the way of bluetooth earbuds if you don't like the band of a traditional bluetooth headset.--------------------------------I was really excited to get these because my current bluetooth headset is prone to water damage and that's a big no-no for workouts. I was very disappointed to quickly find that apparently my ears are way too small to keep these in place. I didn't think my ears were exceptionally small, but when looking at the pictures of the man wearing them, the top of his ear goes up in front of the band that goes around the ear. My ear is far shorter and the top of the band flops right over with nothing to hold it in place. This inevitably means that any amount of light activity causes them to fall right out of my ears. I tried to conform them to the shape of my ear, but there is no flexibility there and I didn't want to break them. Aside from the fact that they fall off, they are very lightweight and comfortable. I can wear them around the house without issue. Though if I turn my head too quickly, they will fly out thanks to the rubber band that connects the two earbuds to each other which tends to stick to the back of my neck. Thankfully, the plus side to the rubber band ensures that when the earbuds DO fall off my ears, they aren't going to fall on the ground and stay on my shoulder until I put them back in.I also think the sound quality is absolutely fantastic. Very clear and full. The earbuds themselves are very comfortable in my ear and the rest of the unit is so light I hardly notice it's there. I have long hair though, so I have a tendency to tuck my hair behind my ears and, of course, this will knock them off. It's hard to fight that urge so I just tie my hair back. The controls are also very easy to access and responsive. The actual unit feels like it's made of high quality materials and they look pretty sleek. I even tried to recreate the issue I read throughout these reviews about the constant interference if you don't wear your phone/music player on your right arm. The directions even do show this, but I thought, what the heck? And I tried to block the signal by putting my phone behind me and under me. I even sat on it and had zero interference. I'm wearing them right now and I can leave my phone on my desk and wander around the house and still no interference. I read that being outside causes this interference because there are fewer surfaces for the signal to bounce off of. I have no idea if that's true, but I went outside and again tried to break the line of sight to the headset however I could, and I still have no interference! All this just makes me that much sadder about the fact that they don't fit my ears because they seem like an awesome headset in all other aspects.The voice prompts are also really nice. I get annoyed with my other headset because it isn't really clear when they are on or off, but you can put these on, turn them on, and the headset tells you when it turns on, off, when a call ends, etc. The call ended notification is really nice on the occasion when your call is dropped and you don't realize it for 15 seconds and keep on talking. The battery indicator on my iPhone for the actual headset is a nice feature as well since there is really nothing on board that tells me how much time I have left.Overall, I think this headset has a great set of features and fantastic performance. The only thing I would suggest improving is making the earpiece adjustable so everyone can wear them comfortably without fear of them falling off.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FVNHBI" id="B005FVNHBI-review39" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-10-24:</strong> I ordered this Jabra Sport Bluetooth headset because I do some trail riding on a mountain bike and also do work around the house. I had been using wired headphones and they worked well but occasionally I'd turn my head a bit to far and the cord would pull and one would pop out. When doing yard work that isn't a big deal but when riding a big it can get caught in the wheel and I have ruined a pair or two of headphones like that.So, bluetooth is the way I wanted to go and tried these out. I really like them let me say that right off the start. The only con I can find so far is that the battery life on these is reported to only be around 3 hours. I would have liked these to had a much longer battery life, but then again when you feel how light these are you understand they really couldn't add more duration without weight. Part of the joy of these is how lightweight they are. I figure 3 hours is long enough for most of my treks.Pairing these up to your phone is really easy. Turn the headset on and it talks to you, then pair with your phone and within a few seconds your ready to go, easy as that. One thing I love about this that I didn't realize it had was an FM radio! There are a few great stations here in Nashville that I listen to so it's really nice that I don't have to have my phone bluetooth turned on and instead can use the fm receiver in these to listen to local stations and save phone battery power. I love this feature!As for the headset itself, it's pretty comfortable, you really don't feel like you are wearing anything and the cord that connects these together is just long enough to go around your head and not so long it gets caught on your collar or jacket.Overall I was really impressed with how fast these were to get paired up and how good the sound is. The headphones do come with multiple tips so if the defaults don't fit your ears you can try alternatives to get a good for, as for me the  default are perfect.Very happy with this headset, very easy to use,  clear and crisp sound and not bad looking at all. I may actually wind up bringing these to work with me to wear while at my desk, then charge them up during lunch.. These are exactly what I was looking for and better then I had hoped.With all the praise why did I take off one star? Battery life. If they could have gone to 4 or 5 hours It would be a 5 star product, at 3 hours I'm not jumping for joy, just content.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FVNHBI" id="B005FVNHBI-review40" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-13:</strong> I've used Jabra corded earbuds for the last six months or so, so I was really excited to use the Bluetooth version, and they did not disappoint.  First off, if you have used Jabra earbuds before, these fit pretty much exactly the same, which is to say, they are exercise comfortable, by which I mean they stay firmly in place and aren't uncomfortable, but I wouldn't want to wear them for working at my desk or other non-pysical activities.  My biggest complaint is that you can't skip tracks using the device, you have to manually go to the device you are hooked up to.  I should also note that while I don't doubt the complaints about cutting in and out, I wear my phone in an armband when I run and haven't experienced this phenomenon, so proximity may play a role (although there is no excuse for a  Bluetooth device to be limited to such a short distance).  On the balance, these are great sport earbuds, and if they had the ability to skip tracks they would be solidly five stars.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FVNHBI" id="B005FVNHBI-review41" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-30:</strong> I just got these this week and I love them.  Just have a few complaints, battery life is very short, and the yellow strap catches on the back of your neck and pulls them out of your ear.  I have a fix for the later of the two, I wear the strap under my chin on the front and they seem to work.  They have great sound, I am getting around 3 hours of music out of them as of right now.Update  here it is on March the 31st.  I have used them just over a month and they are shot.  They still turn on and charge but the buttons do not work.  You can not adjust the volume,  so I can use them in the gym as it is not very loud in there but as far as running outside, I would look for something that would last longer as these cost more than many others.  I have tried many different ones and have yet to find any that can hold up.  The only ones that I have had that still work are the iKross,  But the Jabra were easier to pack, if they dont last they are not worth it.  Plus the ear buds are very hard on your ears, and they fall out when you sweat/</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FVNHBI" id="B005FVNHBI-review42" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-09-11:</strong> As the title implies, I own all of these headsets.  I wanted something primarily for bluetooth music streaming for various situations like excercising, simple morning walks, streaming while at my kids afterschool activities, etc...I had the moto s9 non hd years ago but didnt get much use, it was flawed in a lot of ways so I moved on to the s10hd a few months back, it was a definite improvement but i wanted more thus began the collection.  The Jabra Sport bluetooth is something I really desired, it answered alot of my wishes from the spec sheet, i pursued finiding it in stock asap, what a collasal letdown it was though.I'll go by categories, first being the Fit.I felt the Jabra won fairly easily here.  The s10-HD are bulky in the back, not the easiest or quickest to put on right and frankly hurt my ear canals after a bit of use.  I experimented with the different ear piece fits and settled on one that gave me the best sound but in turn, it did hurt after a bit.  I also wear glasses and out of the three this was the one that I had to fiddle with to put it on over my glasses.  I also hated how bending my neck even slightly back would cause my back to hit up against the massise back battery houseing.The Jaybirds ended up fitting pretty good, again it took a bit of trial and error to get the right ear peice fits but I did end up settling on something that was fairly easy to put on but gave a secure fit.  I'm not a fan of the over the ear fits so on a 'being partial to something' level, it was my favorite style of fit. it's one major drawback is however once you sweat and turn your head, the back wire grabs on your neck which is annoying in itself but even more, it tugs on the earpieces.  Depending on the earpieces you pick, i could see this tugging them out.  Jaybird has since released a new type of fitting set along with now, over the ear add on clips that were available on their website.  I ended up with a newer version of the set and box that included all these new fittings in it.  Mine never tugged out on the treadmill, but it did get increasingly more of a nuisance.  the back wire is longer then the one on the jabra and comes with a shortening clip, adjusting it to various lengths never brought any relief with this issue.Even though not a fan over the over the ear fit on the jabra and s10, the jabra's fit like a dream i must admit.  They are the easiest to put on, the ear piece offerings are on the paltry side but i did find a good fit amongst them.  This also has the tugging/sweating issue of the jaybirds but with the over the ear fit, it felt much more stable and the tugging wasn't as noticeable to the level of the jaybirds.SoundI felt the jaybirds won this one easily, they are more of a in-ear fit where as the others aren't quite there.  the s10's i guess can be somewhat in-ear but they are so massive so you don't get that seal you get with the jaybirds while the jabra's have no in ear fit option.  The in ear fit and sealing makes all the difference, they also get louder then the other two, again probably due to the in ear factor.  between the s10 and jabra it could be a virtual tossup i guess, I would probably put the s10's marginally ahead of the jabras mainly because it's ear pieces can create a partial seal.  the jaybirds had a fuller, richer sound.  I have read somewhere that early revisions on these sets may have had lesser quality sound, never confirmed that.  Mine were new and great.optionsThe jabras have multipoint and fm radio allthough the fm radio experience was garbage for me.  I live in scottsdale, arizona and from in my house, i could tune two hispanic radio stations.  Not hispanic, don't understand it so pointless for me.  Outdoors, it got slightly better, I got one additional station, a english one but beyond that, i missed out on most of the fm offerings here.  I have never really needed multipoint so its a non issue for me.  The jaybirds come with quite a few fitting options so they win there allthough their use of a propietary usb charging cable is a dumb choice, you'll be carrying this wire around with you.  the jabra did not come with a carrying case as was reported on some sites, it has a ac charger but no detachable micro usb wire.  the moto s10 also doesn't come with a case, i used the one i had from the s9.  the jaybirds come with a very sleek looking case allthough its not easily closable when putting the usb cable inside with the earphones.call qualityall of these stink here, but for me it wasn't a killer negative.  these devices are designed to be worn for stereo music when you are working out.  In a pinch, they can perform a call or more likely, recieve one.  these are not everyday, make all your calls thru it sets so for me it's hard to negatively rate how bad they are at calls.Does it work?here comes the hammer, you would figure this section is not needed but wow was the jabra a letdown here.  My jaw was on the ground at how bad it is.  All headsets have that pic in the manual that shows use a armband for optimal use but in the case of the jabra, its essentially the only way it will work.  I went for a quick walk this morning and put the iphone4 in the pocket and it was dropout city.  I have had every jawbone ever made, multiple bt sets before that, the jaybird, the moto, nothing ever gave me a dropout with the phone in the pocket.  after some experimenting, the issue is basically it needs a clear, front facing line of sight to the iphone or whatever is transmitting the signal.  while walking, i had to hold the phone in front of me at belly level, anything below the waist would cut out.  i couldnt even hold it in my hand out of pocket, arm down to the side.  anything on the left side of me cut out.  if i put the phone behind me, it would cut out.  but if i laid it below the waist on the ground but still kept a front facing line of sight with it, it would work.  in a hypothetical situation on a treadmill, if i set it on the treadmill in front of me, it will work.  but once it goes beneath the waist, left side or behind me it would cutout and eventually disconnect.  even if it was on the right side of me, right of the headset, it would still cutout.  putting the phone stationary and turning my head to the side so my right was facing it, it would cut out.  it has to be in front.  even on a armband and a swing my arm a certain way or position the phone to the back of the arm, it will cutout so even the armband has to be positioned a certain way and obviously the armband cant be on the left side.  I have never seen anything this pathetic. essentially the only way to assure it doesn't cutout is to go to Joby's website, by the biggest gorillapod, wrap it around your belly and mount your phone.  Jabra shoulda bsolutely be humiliated, ashamed of themselves for letting this thru qt inspection.Jaybirds win handsdown, not as good of a fit and no fm but better sound and the fact that it works trump it easily.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FVNHBI" id="B005FVNHBI-review43" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-31:</strong> I've had these for a few years already. these are the best head set I've ever had.

When worn, each earpiece wraps around your ear, holding an earbud in place, and the earpieces are connected by a non-removable yellow cord that goes across the back of your neck.  The right earpiece has four buttons: power; radio on/off/answer calls; and a pair of volume/track forward/back buttons.  The unit charges through a micro-B usb port (wall charger included) and has built in bluetooth, fm radio, and is integrated to the endomondo fitness app for iphone.What I liked:- The sound is good for a workout, and the unit works fine as a phone earpiece and stereo headset with all of the bluetooth devices in our house.  (Nokia Nuron, iPhone 3GS, and Blackberry Curve).- Battery life is excellent.- I found the fit to be great, even without trying out the various interchangeable earbuds.  The headset stayed comfortably in place while running, jumping, and exercising of all sorts.What could be better:- Outdoor range is limited.  Indoors, you can have the bluetooth broadcast device anywhere in the room.  Outdoors, you need to have your phone or other bluetooth device in an armband on your right side.  This is much more limited that other devices I've used - my phone earpiece, for example, works fairly well with my device on my belt or even in a pants pocket on the same side, but the Sport doesn't come close to that.  Ultimately, since I need to have my phone within 2 feet of the right earpiece outdoors, I'm not sure how much this adds to a wired version.Note:- I would love to use this for TV, but like all bluetooth devices, the coding to and from bluetooth introduces a delay in the audio that would make this unsuitable for television.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FVNHBI" id="B005FVNHBI-review45" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-16:</strong> I wish you could wear them with any kind of glasses....because they go around the back of your ears it's really not a workable solution.

After cycling through earbuds on a bi-monthly basis due to my unforgiving workouts, I think I've finally found some long-lasting phones. They sound great and can put up with shock and the strains of intense runs. The moldable earpieces conform to the shape of your ear and won't pop out (a traumatic experience to runners or bikers, believe me). The problem with the other Jabra headsets I've had was the long yellow wire that connected the ear pieces and my iPod. The Bluetooth version solves that predicament nicely. With just a wire to connect the two ear pieces, you don't have to worry about a wire getting in the way of flailing arms or flapping up and smacking you in the face during your 25-mph marathons. The main problem is that the device needs to be fairly close for the Bluetooth to work. Since I don't like to use an armband, this makes performance an issue, though I haven't had the types of problems described in other reviews.*** As it turns out, Jabra also has excellent customer service. You should feel very confident with your purchase.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FVNHBI" id="B005FVNHBI-review47" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-10-26:</strong> I have used these for a few runs of 3.5 miles and also on an exercise bike for an hour.  They worked great streaming music through my Blackberry.  As an added bonus, they also allow you to take calls - but the caller on the other end said I was difficult to hear.I had no problem pairing these and, once paired, they reconnect automatically.  I have not had any problem with the battery after several hours of use.  It charges using the same micro-USB that many other things take, so I do not need to carry additional chargers with me when I travel.The sound quality is fine, not amazing, and not extremely loud.I have not had any problems with sound cutting out, as described in other reviews.  I have had my Blackberry in an arm band, on the handlebars of my exercise bike, and even across the room.UPDATE:  I wanted to update this review now that I have been using these for several months.  I really like them a LOT.  They have become an essential part of my workout and I use them several times a week.  I also find that they use very little charge, and I only need to charge them once a week or so.  The lack of a wire bouncing around is a MAJOR plus.  These are also really lightweight and have held up well to some pretty sweat soaked workouts.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FVNHBI" id="B005FVNHBI-review48" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-23:</strong> I recently received a set of Bluetooth headphones and was instantly hooked by the lack of wires. I used them in the gym and found the freedom amazing but the heft and lose fit less than ideal. After a lot of research and review reading I decided on the Jabra Sport and couldn't have been happier. I do not like in the ear headphones for workouts as I find they are constantly losing in my ears during very active workouts. That isn't a problem I have with this behind the ears model. The cable connecting the two is also flexible meaning they don't come lose when I put my head on the bench or sit up mat. I love the freedom from cables that the bluetooth provides. I not longer have to worry about tearing my headphones out of my ear when running or doing box jumps. Often I just leave my Nexus in my sweatshirt and walk about the gym without it. I've found range inside is decent and outside very good, up to 100 feet in some cases.Set up was easy and they connected to my Nexus almost instantly. Sound is good and they come with three different sizes of ear insert. Find a proper sized insert is important to prevent discomfort during long workouts as well as getting the best sound possible. While heavier than most in ear models they don't seem it because they are supported by the entire ear. The sound is good and what I expected from plug in headphones. The buttons are stiff and keeps me from accidently changing volume or songs, which is nice. Another important factor for me was they had passed the military moisture/dust/shock standards. I can be rough on my headphones and have worked out in up to 130 degree temperatures in the Middle East. So I've had lesser headsets die from the heat or sweat that creates. Not an issue I've had with these. My only grip is that battery life has not been ideal and when the charge wears down they have a tendency to cut in and out before getting the low power warning.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FVNHBI" id="B005FVNHBI-review49" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-19:</strong> Amazon Vine Review:I've been switching back and forth between Plantronics BackBeat and Motorola S9 for a couple years now. But lately, I find that my BackBeats don't fit as well as they used to, so I've been reaching for my S9 more and more. Only problem is, I'm really not all that fond of the wraparound band on the S9 since it makes it impossible to rest your head back and listen to music. Also, that band often hits the back of my wheelchair headrest and often pops off my head. So it's been on my mind that I may be in the market for a new stereo headset.Enter Jabra SportThe first thing I noticed about these headphones is the wire connecting the left and right earbuds -- it's very pliable and flexible. By contrast, the wire on my BackBeats is much thicker and stiffer, and does not bend as freely as the wire on this Jabra. The wire on this Jabra Sport is thin, pliable and much more comfortable to wear, be it during activity, or kicking back just to enjoy some tunes.Easier ControlsAnother plus for these Jabras over the BackBeats and S9, is that all the controls are located on the right earbud only. This is a huge improvement. To this day, I still find myself fumbling to remember which ear does what with my other 2 headsets; is left for volume and right for track skip? Or is it the other way around? It gets especially confusing the more I switch between the BackBeats and the S9. But thanks to the streamlined button layout on the Jabra Sport, that won't be an issue.No Huge Glowing LEDs -- Yay!It's a pet peeve of mine -- I hate huge glowing LEDs that scream "look at me, I'm wearing a bluetooth headset!" Thankfully, Jabra had the smarts to just put a small, understated LED on this one; about the size of a pinhole, which is plenty big for a glowing LED. I know this may not be a big plus to most people, but it is to me.Sound QualityThese sound really great to me; on par with my BackBeats and S9. In fact, these Jabras seem a bit richer in sound. They go pretty loud, but I always find myself wishing all my headsets could go 2 or 3 decibels louder than they do. Either I'm going deaf, or I just like my music loud. But that seems to be an issue across the board for all the headsets I've tried, so I often boost my MP3s manually a few notches to hit the volume I like.Good FitI did have to play around with the 3 different sized ear gels to get the fit I want, but it didn't take long and these Jabras actually fit me best over my other 2 headsets.Short Charging CordThis seems to be a Jabra thing, because I have a regular bluetooth headset of theirs too just for calls, and the cord on that charger is literally 3 inches! They've upped the ante on this one and given us a whopping 7 or 8 inches of cord, but still much too short. Not sure why they're doing this, but it's definitely a running theme with Jabra. The good news is, these use a standard micro USB charger, so I'll be using one of my better, long corded chargers with these.Built In FM RadioI don't listen to the radio much anymore, but I really thought this was a neat feature and like knowing it's there. Just don't expect tuning to be very easy because there's no display or preset channels. But it's still a nice touch.Simple Paring -- 30 seconds topsGreat User Manual -- brief and to the point, with an excellent layout that enables you to read descriptions and turn pages while still having a numbered diagram of the headset visible. Perfect!Bluetooth SignalI'm convinced that environmental variables, and device capability play a huge factor in different user's experiences with bluetooth connection; some cell phones are better than others, and some environments more problematic than others. For me, the bluetooth connection on these Jabras is on par with all my other headsets. Yes, I get the occasional dropout, but no better or worse than any other headset I own. IMO, there's nothing more reliable, or rock-solid, than an actual wired connection, no matter if it's bluetooth headsets, wireless speakers, wireless HDMI, or cordless phones; just my opinion.Terrible Packaging -- be prepared to burn some calories just getting this headset unboxed! Terrible! Definitely NOT frustration free.Call quality -- is decent; no better or worse than any of my other headsets.Connect to 2 Devices at the same time -- huge bonus! Mine is paired to my cell phone and my Toshiba Thrive tablet. Yay!Bottom Line -- I really like this Jabra Sport and fully expect to use them as my new go-to headset over my BackBeats and S9. But I gotta dock 1 star for the terrible packaging and the ridiculously short charging cord; yes, it's that inconvenient. Otherwise, these are pretty great and I like the look and feel.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FVNHBI" id="B005FVNHBI-review50" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-01-07:</strong> Jabra SPORT Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Black/Yellowprovide a rich listening experience with exceptional sound quality.

Most bluetooth sets, up until now, have been used with a cell phone as a talking/listening device only. In many of these instances, the user is still, as in a car.

The charge lasts a long time. I don't use them for commuting anymore, just for working out. It's nice to have no dangling wires. But when running outdoors, I seem to lose the connection if I put my phone in the pocket of my shorts/pants, so you definitely need an armband or a pocket on your shirt jacket that you can use.Okay, just received this headset today, so it's just initial impressions. I will update this after some use.After waiting for a full charge (manual says 2 hours, but this wasn't necessary for mine), I eagerly tested it out. Most important, I want to let potential shoppers know this headset paired easily with my Nokia Lumia 920 running Windows Phone 8. I don't have a distance test, yet, as I've only used it with my phone in my shirt pocket.MusicI've used it to listen to music. The play/pause button works; the volume buttons work (but it's just adjusting the headset volume, not the volume on the phone itself -- that's how the Apple headset works with the iPhone). The skip forward and skip back buttons worked, too (just hold the volume rocker for one second).Phone CallsI've only done one test call and it was indoors, but voice comes through surprisingly well. With the microphone by your ear, I figured it would be hard to be heard, but it wasn't -- nice and clear.FitI'm a 6'2" man (slightly taller than average) and I think my ears are fairly standard in size, neither too large or too small, and the headset fit comfortably on my head and on my ears. It does not feel heavy in the least. It also does not feel loose. The buds fit comfortably in my ears without the extra attachments included in the package. The buds are not sound isolating, which is safer when using them outdoors (remember to keep the volume low outside so you can hear potential danger coming your way).Less important aspects:PackagingPlastic clamshell which is just awful for the environment (why not have packaging for online sales different than packaging for sales in stores where they need to be displayed?). Even if other companies do it too, no free pass for Jabra. For a company that makes such high quality products, they clearly know they are selling lots of product online which requires no presentation packaging. At least it was not difficult to open the clamshell.ManualThe instructions are incredibly tiny. They are easy to understand (English version at least, also includes French, Portugese, and Spanish) and the graphics are clear.

I have had no issues with performance when the Iphone is in my pocket, in my hand, etc. I mention this because other reviewers seemed to have an issue with this if the phone was not directly in front of them. I did not have that at all. I used it while doing yard work and the sound was clear and the headset was very comfortable.The headset does come with a build in radio but that aspect is by no means perfect. Reception was quite poor and, if you like to listen to the radio 24/7 you won't want to use the built in tuner in it.When fully charged the set last for a little over two hours as  blue tooth and closer to three hours if used only with the radio tuner.The earbuds are comfortable, the set sits nicly behind the ears (the thicker ones can be uncomfortable) and it is really nice not to have the cord to tangle with.In sum, a good buy.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FVNHBI" id="B005FVNHBI-review58" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-16:</strong> they don't' fit the ear well, and the plastic parts that go on the earphone portions keep falling off.

They are top notch and worked well with my iPhone 4S, even providing a battery status indicator at the top of the iPhone's screen.  Audio range and quality is excellent, and I made a number of phone calls with good reviews from those on the receiving end.  Surprisingly these fit my ears very well without having to use the included ear pieces.I did find that the audio cuts out frequently and does not play consistently when the iPhone is placed in my pocket.  I'd suggest getting an arm band or some other way to strap the device to yourself as opposed to carrying it in a pocket.

He spent the whole first day with them listening to Pandora and music from his Samsung Galaxy II, and couldn't say enough great things about these! Being that he's over six feet tall, and a larger build than me by quite a bit, he had no issues with these staying in his ears, and doing so comfortably. I DO have to say that the call sound quality on these leaves MUCH to be desired, however, as we were on the phone as he wore these, and, as the person on the other end of the line, I can unequivocally say that these made his voice truly sound like he was in a tunnel, and talking from across it as wind whipped through it. Badly distorted, distant, poor-quality call audio. For listening to music, the radio, and working out, though, these, in HIS opinion, were pretty spectacular. So, one star added back for those of you that can comfortably wear these, but still a one star penalty for call quality, and the wearability of these when it comes to smaller ears...~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~Since way back when I got my first cellphone, I've been a loyal fan of Jabra products since, for the most part, they've proven themselves reliable in the creation of quality cellphone headsets (I'm still not sure with regards to their in-car Bluetooth speakers, but their headsets have always been great). Really, this headset does not necessarily skew from that path, outside of the fact that it's meant to be worn while working out, and the over-the-ear pieces just won't stay in or on my ears. Really, I thought I was doing something wrong, until I saw that others have mentioned the same issue with theirs (which prompted me to think, "OH! It's NOT just me!!!"). Since then, I've taken note of the fact that a fairly sizable-looking man is pictured both on the product packaging and in the product page images here. Noticing those details, I'm thinking that these are marketed somewhat more strongly for men, or those who happen to have ears that are larger than my average-sized-for-a-woman ears...The features offered by this stereo headset really are great, and it seems to me that Jabra has thought of just about everything one might be looking for in a Bluetooth headset to work out with. Since you don't need me to reiterate the features of this headset, I will say that I found the flat yellow cord attaching the two earpieces to be a bit short and uncomfortable for my taste. It did feel a LOT like having a rubber band strapped against the back of my neck, and I found the cord lightly pulling against my longer hair - which wasn't necessarily pleasant - but I don't see that affecting any of the men out there that have short enough hair that it doesn't hang down over the band. Overall, I found myself wishing that the band was made of a softer, longer, adjustable-length fabric-coated cord. The control buttons (all located on the right earpiece) are low-profile, but not so difficult to find as the ones on my HTC Rezound, and they're well thought-out, so they cover all the bases (and then some) for the purpose(s) that these are intended.Additionally, if you tend to wear glasses while working out, you may find yourself adjusting the headset to properly accommodate any thicker arms(/temples), due to the girth of the ear pieces.At this point, I guess it's time to hand these over to my guy, and see what he thinks of them, and how well they fit, and stay, in his ears during his morning runs... If he feels they work better for him, I'll be sure to update this review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FVNHBI" id="B005FVNHBI-review62" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-01-12:</strong> I have a pair of the corded version of the headphones which I use most every day.  I have been happy with the performance of the corded version, but I have been a bit annoyed by the heavy cord between my phone and the headsets.  The cord is heavy duty and so has a bit of weight to it which means that bounces around a lot and it pulls off the clip which is supposed to keep it attached to your shirt.  Therefore, I was very pleased to be given the chance to try this Bluetooth version of the headphones.The Jabra SPORT Bluetooth Stereo Headset are lightweight headphones which are held in place by earhooks which tuck behind each ear. The earhooks are bendable so that you can position the speaker in front or your ear canal. The headphones are lightweight and comfortable to wear and the sound quality is good. The headphones include a volume control and a microphone so that you can use the headphones to make calls on your phone.The Bluetooth version has earhooks that are twice as thick as the corded version, but they are still comfortable to wear.  The earhooks sit comfortably around your ears. Once the headphones are positioned, I barely notice that they are there due to the lightness and comfortable material of the earhooks. I have been using the headphones while running and have had no problems with the headphones staying in place. The headphones don't move at all. I have worn the headphones under a wool hat while running and I didnt really feel that they were there.  I like the way that the speakers sit right outside of my ear canal. Unlike earbuds, the speakers are not pushed into the ear canal and I found this approach to be more comfortable than wearing earbuds.The headphones come with three Eargels (basically, a piece of molded rubber which fits between the speaker and your ear) so that you can get a good fit between the speaker and your ear. When running on roads, I can choose an Eargel which does not offer a snug fit so that I can still hear traffic noise so that I know when a car is approaching from behind me.I have connected the Bluetooth Headset to my Nexus S phone, my iPod touch and my computer.  The first pairing is very easy.  Additional pairings are straightforward.  The instructions read that you must push a button on the headset for 4 seconds.  I found that you really had to hold the button for four seconds.  Any shorter and the pairing would not occur.  The sound quality from my phone and iPod was very good.  My computer caused the headset to sound tinny, but that was probably due to the settings on my computer.I have used the headset while making telephone calls and while making calls over Skype and have been very pleased with the clarity of the microphone.As to the durability of the headphones, I have worn them in the rain with no discernible problems.However, there are some problems with the headset.  The instructions show that if you hold your player in your hand when you run, you must keep it in your right hand to avoid the signal to the headset from being dropped.  Better still, the players should be held on your arm when you run.  However, I ran with my phone in my hand and I found that the signal was dropped periodically when I extended my arm forward.  So sometimes, the signal is dropped with every stride. Other times, I can go miles without a problem.  I have yet to figure out why the signal is dropped at some times and not others.Another problem is that the earhooks are connected to each other by a cord that runs around the back of your neck.  The cord is heavy and flat rather than round.  On cold days, I dont notice the cord.  But, on hot days when there is sweat on my neck, the cord tends to stick to my neck.  This means that when I turn my head, the cord does not move and tugs on the headsets.  This can be uncomfortable over time.  I have found that twisting the cord so that it cant lay flat on my neck helps somewhat.Pros:-  Very freeing to not have a cord hanging between your player and your headset-  Good audio quality-  Very durable-  The earhooks are lightweight and comfortableCons:-  The signal is periodically dropped if you hold the player in your hand-  The cord between the earhooks can get stuck to your neck when you sweat which tugs on the earhooks and is uncomfortable</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FVNHBI" id="B005FVNHBI-review63" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-11:</strong> These things area great for workouts.  Honestly, after using a bluetooth headset while working out in the summer of 2012 I could never go back to using a corded device.Running is easier because there's no flopping cord and you don't have to route it anywhere.  Lifting is more fluid because you have a greater range of motion without a cord, and the cord won't get pressed against your body in an awkward way if you are bench pressing or squatting.  The list goes on and on.However, there are some noticeable downsides.- The sound quality is below that of a corded device, like the Apple Earbuds or something more advanced like a Shure setup.  But you're trading sound quality for ease of use and sport-specific benefits, so this shouldn't be an issue for most people.- The battery is punny.  When you first open your headset and use it you'll probably have a decent battery life, but after 3-6 months of using mine (the third one I got after warrantying the first two - more on that later...) the device will only last for a 30-minute run, and sometimes not even!  This is by far the biggest issue for me.- The fit isn't great.  The earpieces fall out of my ears and the included tips don't make it any better.  It's annoying when I'm running fast into the wind, or biking, and the music is overridden by a big whoosh!  They've never fallen off me while exercising, however, so at least there is that.I would recommend buying this product if you can't find anything else.  The biggest problem for me is the battery life, and I've had to return two units while owning this for just over a year.  At least Jabra doesn't give me any hassle, but I would love for this product to just work!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FVNHBI" id="B005FVNHBI-review64" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-03:</strong> I own several Jabra products and have never had problems with them.

Totally wrong!!!... This is a bad quality product, it worked well for around two weeks, then it stayed turning on and off by itself, so I couldn't used it anymore. I had to contact product support and they send me a new replacement item. I thought this second headset would fullfil my expectatives. Not at all!!... The second headset lasted even less than the first one, I just used it once, until its battery went low, then I tried to charged and Oh Surpirse, it didn't!!!... I checked the conection to see if may I didn't plugged it correctly, everything was OK, it simply didn't charge. Obviously the battery died and I couldn't use it. I tried with a different charger from a friend of mine who had recently purchased the same headset, and it didn't work as well, so it was not a Charger issue. I had to contact Amazon Product Support again and they offered me a refund which I immediately accepted.Some additional disadvantages:- This headset is really unconfortable, the ear plugs are too big and they hurt your ear, unless you have big ears. I tried with all the ear plug covers but couldn't find the way to fit them confortably.- The yellow wire that link both earphones is too long, and it get stuck to your neck when you turn your head, specially if you are training or working out. So if you look to any side the wire will stick to your neck and one of the earphones will be taken out of your ear. So definitely it is not as &#34;sport&#34; as it name states.- FM option sucks!!!... you will never get a radio station, if you get it, it will hurt your ears with the desperating noise.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FVNHBI" id="B005FVNHBI-review67" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-14:</strong> This product is good it is small and not bulky behind the ears but the gel price won't stay in place in my ear.

It is light weight, secure to wear, and lasts longer than most workouts. I am getting close to 5 hours of audio before she tells me "Low Battery". It's the same female voice that's in my Jabra Cruizer 2. Since it is marketed as a `Sport' accessory, the bright yellow accents are appropriate, but I would prefer a more subtle color. Also, I like the random mix from my favorite radio station, so the built-in FM tuner is brilliant.At a total weight of 0.81 ounces (24 grams), these headphones are as light as my Rx glasses. Since I am accustomed to wearing something hanging on my ears, the Jabra Sport headphones are like having a stereo in my head. They are well formed to fit comfortably on your ears, so most not accustomed to wearing something on their ears won't have much trouble getting used to them. One exception may be those whose ears lay very close to their head, mine do not.As mentioned previously, these headphones fit securely. This is a must for serious athletic activity. While I am not an athlete, I spend my fair share of time in the gym. The Jabra Sport could be worn while freestyle running or head-banging.I have been experiencing one recurring problem. The audio intermittently dies. I'm not sure if this is a headset or device (phone, MP3 player, etc.) issue. My device is a Motorola Atrix 4G. I fix the audio by restarting the headset. If the device shows Bluetooth disconnected, the restart of the headset will solve the problem. If the device does not indicate Bluetooth disconnected, I have to leave the headset turned off, restart the device's Bluetooth, then turn the headset back on. The audio is restored.I read a review from someone who was able to fix their problem with their Jabra Sport by updating the firmware. My box shows the firmware at version 1.19. I downloaded the firmware update from Jabra's website and followed the instructions included in the zipped download. Unfortunately, the update software did not function so the issue persists.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FVNHBI" id="B005FVNHBI-review69" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-07:</strong> Another bluetooth headset bit the dust.

I loved the lengthy cord that you could also shorten with the clip. Very handy. I loved the fact that they were sweat-proof and water resistant since I tend to pour sweat when I run. This feature helped a lot during my runs.These earbuds are far superior though compared to the Sennheiser's just based on the fact that they are wireless. I loved the ease of the Bluetooth access and although I have NOT tried out the phone I love that it is an option just in case! I just haven't received a call while out jogging so I haven't tested that aspect out.The volume is superior to my Sennheiser volume which seems a bit tinny at times and almost seems to fade in and out during runs. The Jabra headset sounds clear and the ear pieces hook onto my ears FAR more comfortably. The Sennheiser's were fine but I had to have the foam covering replaced for my left ear after it fell off. These are way more secure and comfy. Not nearly as irritable on the ear. They seem a lot more plush and way less pinchy then my Sennheisers.This has also proved to be super easy to pair with Bluetooth devices. I have had no issues getting it synced to my I-pod touch. It is BEYOND easy and fast. Love it!Overall, really impressed with this headset. Love them. They are amazing!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FVNHBI" id="B005FVNHBI-review71" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-05:</strong> It says that they are built to Military standards for Dust/sand/wetness (sweat).

I started off reading the business card sized instructions. The diagrams showing the buttons were so tiny it took me a few times to figure it out. I suggest going right to the website for a better PDF version that is readable. While reading the manual online I immediately plugged in the headset to fully charge which took about 2 hrs. The plug is not even a foot long and I thought that was a way too small. I have it hanging from my wall socket and it just reaches the floor. I know the product manufacturers often read these reviews and you guys really need to make that plug much longer. If your at work you have to crawl under your desk to find a plug and then possibly step on it...not good.An odd thing is that Jabra suggests for outdoor use, is that you keep your phone on your arm using an armband and it also says not to put it in our pocket or on the left side of your body. I know that bluetooth had 30 foot radius so I don't understand why they suggested those 2 things. I used it at the gym before typing this review and I had no problem with it in my pocket, indoors or outdoors.This headset can also be used as a headset for phone calls too which is nice because if your out and about or working out you don't have to stop what your doing and grab your phone.  The small problem with this is that the microphone is on the side of both ears so you will find yourself speaking louder to compensate. I'm told that I sounded a little low but that's what will happen when the microphone is on the side of the ear. Not a deal breaker for me because i'm really using these just for the wireless music feature and the style of over the ear headphones.Cosmetically, they look like most of the Jabra style earphones which are comfortable and stay put in your ear. They come with additional rubber earbuds to customize your fitting. I would have liked to have the choice of colors of the wire and accents. They come in yellow which for years has been the color signifying sport style. I would have liked blue and i'm sure girls would like pink.Jabra also claims Up to 4.5 hours of talk time, 3 hours of music time, 4 days of standby time. From what I experienced its about right if not a just a little less. I like that they have 3 different led colors letting you know what the status is for various things happening. they have green, blue and red. The instructions online give you specifics. There is also voice announcements for a few things like low battery and connect/disconnected etc.There's also a free app that you can download which helps you track your fitness but I haven't tested it out. As for the sound I was happily surprised how clear it was. This is my first pair of bluetooth headphones so I can't compare them to others but only to normal wired headphones. There's good bass and the overall stereo sound was nice. They sure beat the OEM earbuds the iPhone comes with. I'm using these with an iPhone 4 and it was super easy to pair and get working fast. It will also work with an iPod touch and iPad. They also claim that you can pair them with multiple devices so when I finally get an iPad i'll be using this feature.Overall I like them and they are easy to wear especially during workouts. I do know that after easy workout when I get home I take a damp cloth and wipe the headphones off because i've sweated so much that they are wet from it and don't want them to smell...lol Sorry but its the truth.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FVNHBI" id="B005FVNHBI-review73" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-18:</strong> I've had my Jabra Sport BT headset for some time now and I've become very accustomed to the controls and such.  However after extensively using it I'm going to send it back.The Major Pros about these headsets- The design is very attractive.  The highlight yellow gives it a nice pop that you can quickly identify.- No large LED blinking light that slowly saps your power- Comfortable design allowing it to be worn all day with no issue- The flat ribbon that holds the two pieces together is very easy to manage with no issues- The buttons are all on one headset (right side) allowing for quick adjustments on the fly- Stays pretty darn secure on your head when moving around- Gives some mobo jumbo about it being military grade in protection but what really mattered to me was that I could use it fine even if it got sweat on it.  I mean hell they market it as a sports style headset for people who workout.- Good sound quality for wireless headset of this size- VERY easy when it comes to pairing that anyone can do itThe Cons- The battery life is awfully low.  They state 4.5hrs talk, 3hrs of music, and 4days standby but I can't get it to pass 2.5~3hrs of music when working out.- I know these don't really have noise canceling effects but you will hear quite a bit of external noise when using theseThe BIGGEST ISSUE THAT HAS ME SENDING THESE BACK.I won't be keeping this headset.  They have one major issue that I haven't been able to figure out how to fix.  I personally own a Galaxy Nexus, my GF's old iPhone 4, and her iPhone 4S.  We use the old iPhone as a backup for either of us and as an iPod.  I personally use my Galaxy Nexus to listen to music by iHeart/Sirius/Pandora/etc etc and when I head for the gym I either take the Nexus or our old iPhone and no matter what I can't get the damn headset to stop skipping.  When you're in motion these headset will constantly lose connection for 1, 2, 5 etc seconds.  I thought it was my phones BT radio so I tried it on our old iPhone and same thing, used it with her iPhone 4S same issue, friends Galaxy S same issue, Nokia 900 same.  No matter what I do if on the move these headsets will cutout.  Now when you have the item in question on say a table, they won't cut out.  But what's the point?  When these headsets are marketed to people with an active life and it skips when on the move it's worthless.  So with that main issue all the pros of this headset for me anyways are trashed and I will be sending it back to Amazon for a refund.If anyone is wondering the phone is either in my pocket or inside the pouch of a armband made for that phone and the darn thing will not stop skipping when in motion.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FVNHBI" id="B005FVNHBI-review74" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-11-17:</strong> I really like the idea of wireless headsets. It just seems silly to have to plug them in.These seem like a pretty good solution, though they are intended primarily for wearing while working out. Because of this, they aren't as easy to slip on and off when needed.They do need to be kept charged, which is the downside to wireless - every so often you have to connect them to a charging wire. Ah, the irony!I noticed some of the other reviews had trouble with range, and indeed Jabra points out that you should wear your phone (or other music device) on an armband close to the headset. That seemed like a pretty big restriction, so I spent some time trying out ranges. Most of the time I could get great range, but sometimes even moving my phone (it is an iPhone 4) more than a couple of feet away would cause the music to break up.  I suspect it would be worse if there were electrical equipment around or other bluetooth users, which could easily be the case in a gym.So, I like mine, but am a bit cautious regarding the range.Sean P.

The headset worked well with an Evo 3D.The bad news is that it did not fit my small ears and was not comfortable if your are wearing glasses.  Also the sound was choppy when I paired the headset with a Palm Pre which previously worked well with other bluetooth headsets including the Jabra Stone 2.So if you have a newer device, large ears, and don't wear glasses it will probably work very well for you.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FVNHBI" id="B005FVNHBI-review76" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-07:</strong> Maybe I have weird ears (I don't have weird ears), but these things would not stay in place during most exercise routines.

Listen to stereo music (stream through bluetooth or the built-in FM radio tuner) or answer phone calls while you exercise. It is very light and easy to wear (behind the ear fit), and with several size of ear gels, it stays comfortable in place. The battery life is average/acceptable, as it will last about approximately two to three hours of music playback and about 4 hours of talk time. The build is rugged so it can withstand rain, dust and shock.Sidarta Tanu</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FVNHBI" id="B005FVNHBI-review78" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-03:</strong> I'll start with the good stuff (there's not much): they were easy to pair, easy to opperate (volume buttons, playback control, etc was easy to use) and the sound quality was good with music and calls (when they stayed connected).  Initially I was impressed, and I really wanted to like these, but that's about it for the good stuff.  As for the not so good stuff: The part that wraps around the ears is too bulky; they weren't uncomfortable to wear, but as soon as I would start to sweat (even a little) they would start to slide around on my ears, add any sudden movement (you know, like you would do in "sports" and they would completely fall off).  I tried all 3 of the eargels that were included and could not get them to stay put.  I also had problems with them staying connected.  Like most (all?) bluetooth headsets, they recommend using an armband when outdoors so that the bluetooth can work propperly; I did this and the sound still cut out frequently (once every minute or two, and occasional several times per minute), I've tried others that work much better. For a product marketed as a "SPORT" headset, these were useless.  If your primary desire is too listen to music while indoors and sitting still, these would be okay, but there are better options for that too.  If your physical activity involves very little movement of your head (weight lifting, or eliptical machine use, maybe) then these might be okay for you too, but if you plan on biking or running (especially outdoors) don't waste your money on these.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FVNHBI" id="B005FVNHBI-review79" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-10-26:</strong> JUST TOO COOL!If you know someone that likes to listen to music while they run, workout, mow the lawn, etc. THIS IS THE "IT" GIFT FOR THEM!  The freedom that comes from not having cords running from your ears to your phone/ipod/bluetooth device is totally worth it!  I have never written a review using so many exclamation points before!  It's that great! (But remember not to wear them when driving!)PROS:It paired flawlessly with my iPhone 4 in a matter of seconds after the initial 2-hour battery charge. Place the things on your ears, with the yellow band going around the back of your head/neck area for the best comfort. You will hardly know the yellow band is there. I have longer hair and it didn't get tangled in it at all when putting it on or removing it. The sound was amazingly good!CONS: When I tried out answering a phone call and talking with the headphones, the person on the other end complained that there was an awful lot of "white noise" in the background (think hiss) even when I was in a very quiet room.  They also complained that my signal/voice broke up sometimes. I had to make sure after answering that I selected "Blue Tooth Jabra device" again, or I couldn't hardly hear the other person at all.I was worried about the fit, since I have rather small ears (other ear buds by Jabra were too big for my ears) but these little speakers set nicely around my ear, and the sounds was spectacular for something that didn't go in the ear!  It was astonishingly nice!The right earphone has all the buttons and lights on it. It also has the hookup jack for charging it. The jack is covered with a small piece that thankfully is attached to the headphones or I would have lost it by now. It makes a little beeping sound when you touch the buttons so you know your touch actually registered.There is an app you can pair it with called "Endomondo" that will use the GPS in your device to determine how far you run, how long you run, what songs you listen to, etc. I detest anything having to do with exercise, but I'm interested to hear what the "pep talks" and such sound like.  I'll have to leave that for another review elsewhere. The ease of use may just get this couch potato up and moving.  You pretty much have to do some sort of workout that involves movement in order for it to track how far you have gone between start and finish. It will show you on a map exactly where you are at if you enable "location finder" on your device. Very accurate. Very cool. It claims "military grade waterproof" but I don't know to what extent that really means.Overall, great to use for listening to music while working out or doing other stuff.Not so great for phone calls yet, but maybe it was just my location.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FVNHBI" id="B005FVNHBI-review80" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-12-13:</strong> I am very, very disappointed with this headset. As a long time BT adopter, I have had many traditional BT earpieces. A couple of those were made by Jabra and I was always impressed with Jabra's quality. The Jabra SPORT BT Stereo Headset, however, should never have been released.Battery Life: I have NEVER got more than 1.5 hours of music with this Jabra headset. If I used them outside where reception is spotty the battery life is sometimes even less.Reception: This is by far my biggest gripe with this product. The reception is AWFUL. My music cuts out so badly that it sounds like... Well, it sounds terrible. Terrible skips, missing music, sometimes for a full second at a time. Utterly unlistenable. Indoors if the player and headset are within 12 inches of each other it is almost (almost) bearable. If I walk across the room? Forget it. If I put it in my pocket so there's no line of sight? Forget it. If I put it in my pocket and go outside on my bicycle? REALLY FORGET IT.So, for reference, I use this same phone with a 4 year old traditional Jabra earpiece in media mode and I can walk into another room or down the street with no audio cut off. I used the Jabra Stereo Headset with a now 7 years old Pocket PC and it's again unlistenable. The problem definitely lies with the Jabra SPORT.Sound Quality: When the audio does work the sound quality is not awful. The bass is extremely strong but muddy. The highs are overpowered by the bass. Luckily, it doesn't sound overly "digital" like some other BT headsets do. I have a pair of Ultimate Ears SuperFi5 Pros, which I know is not a fair comparison, but if you're looking for audiophile quality, the Jabra's aren't it (I know, not the same type of product). If you're looking for everyday, bass heavy listening, the Jabra's are actually pretty decent.Fit: The fit is not bad. They were comfortable enough for me to wear for about two hours without any pain. Too bad the battery doesn't last that long. Some other reviewers did not like the straps behind their necks but I had no issues with this. I actually liked it because I could hang the headset wire around my neck when not in use.Pairing: Same as any other BT headset. Push and hold the pairing button and wait for blinky lights. Pair. Easy.Telephone Call: Quality was decent. Difficult to quantify but the sound was about as good as any other decent voice headset. People on the other end of the call didn't complain. Unfortunately, the problem with the sound cutting out when not directly next to the phone was still present.Overall, if there were no reception issues I would say this problem is worth your consideration. Unfortunately, because of the extensive reception issues, I cannot recommend this product, at all.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FVNHBI" id="B005FVNHBI-review81" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-10-28:</strong> These headphones work fine when inside a building, but for some reason, they just plain do not work when outside.  The constantly drop out.  Absolutely awful.  I have several Bluetooth headsets and headphones and I have never heard anything as bad as these.  The directions say that you cannot where your phone on your waist with these headphones (which is an absurd design flaw in itself), but even when you where the phone in a chest pocket or on your arm the headphones cut out frequently.There are completely unusable outside, but to write more about them than just that, here is a review from using these headphones exclusively inside, and comparing them to my Motorola SD-10HD headphones:Comfort.  The lightweight and compact design of these is even more comfortable and unobtrusive then the SD-10HDs.  I really look forward to ski season, because I think that these are going to work much better with my ski helmet than the SD-10HDs do.  I give Jabra high marks for comfort.Battery life.  The battery life on these is about half of what it is on the SD-10HDs.  Adequate for most workout use, but a little short for people that want to use them for a full workday.  Since I can't stand even the most comfortable headphones hanging on my ears for more than four hours anyway, I find their life to be adequate.Voice prompts.  Although I could manage without the voice prompts, they are a nice feature.  It is a lot nicer to have a voice telling you the status of your device than having to figure it out from a series of beeps.FM.  For me, I could do without the FM feature.  It is cumbersome to use, and doesn't really add any value to headphones that I got for the purpose of connecting to my phone.  I would have preferred they replaced the FM feature with a track forward/backward toggle.Connectivity.  With my Motorola Triumph, I had no problem connecting, and staying paired.  It took about 2 seconds to connect and hasn't dropped since.Sound.  This headset sounds great.  It is about the same in this regard to the SD-10HDs.Buttons.  The buttons are slightly awkward, but mainly because the ear pieces are so small and lightweight.  The SD-10HDs have more buttons, to control things like track forward and backwards, but overall, I think that the Jabra is good in this regard.Call quality.  The call quality both for you and the person on the other end is good, but not great.  Wind noise affects the call quite a bit.  It is about average in this area since no BT headsets do great when it comes to wind noise.I highly recommend this headset.  I think that there is still room to improve on this technology, but these are a big improvement over the last generation of these devices, especially in terms of comfort and compatibility with bike and ski helmets.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FVNHBI" id="B005FVNHBI-review82" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-14:</strong> My usage:  I have been using these for 4 months, practically every day.Pros:+ VERY comfortable, if you like around-the-ear style headphones like these.+ Excellent sound quality.  Rich bass, and good high tones.+ WILL STAY on you ears for jogging and other streneous activities.  This is key for me - unlike other products, there is nothing that bounces on the back of your neck, the earphones won't fall out, and with bluetooth, nothing gets in your way.+ Controls on the earpiece are simple & easy to use.+ FM radio has decent/pretty good reception.  I was impressed considering it's small size.Cons:- battery life for me has been ~2.5-3.5 hours while streaming music.  Could go on standby for about a day.- Microphone; I always end up holding that earpiece up to my mouth when I have to talk to someone.  Occasionally I can get by with it still on my ear, but the other caller usually says my voice is faint or distant.Other comments:People say the bluetooth is poor: sometimes when I wear my phone as low as on my hip, it DOES skip/get shoddy reception.  when it's above my hip, almost always works fine.Although it's got a short battery life, it charges in only about 2-3 hours.What do I wish this had?A carrying case! - it deserves one, and this would protect and prolong the life of this product.  I got one for $1.More Eargels! - I only get 1 size of each?

The sound quality is poor and the maximum volume setting leaves a lot to be desired.  Additionally, I noticed discomfort after about a half hour of wearing them.

I've been looking for a something that would be water proof, comfortable, and wireless.  These fit the bill as far as that goes.  Everything about how these feel and operate was what I wanted.  However, I was disappointing with the sound. At the gym, I couldn't hear my own music over the sound of the music playing inside the gym.  The volume would not go high enough.  In addition, there was no base!  No option to boost the base is provided, unlike their non-sport version.  The only way to hear the base was to push the earpieces into my ear with my fingers.Today I decided to return them and stick with my LG.  They are water proof enough, light weight and have good sound.  The only issue with them is that the fall off when you use the bench press.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FVNHBI" id="B005FVNHBI-review85" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-20:</strong> Oh, how I love bluetooth headsets. They make doing activities, while listening to music/audiobooks/podcast, much less of a hassle. Working out, biking, or doing housework while wired... drove me nuts sometimes.This set seemed to fill in the gaps that a lot of other sets left open. I do sometimes like to listen to the radio, and my phone does not have a receiver. Also, the band on my motorola bluetooth often gets in the way when I work out. Lastly, even the slightest sprinkle makes me forgo wearing a headset, as I don't want to ruin it. Soooo...Pros:- I feel very safe wearing this thing in the rain. I've biked and run in the rain on many occasions with them- Sound quality... is ok. Not great, but not bad- Volume is also... ok (every time you turn it on, the volume resets to middle volume, a bit of a pain)- Plenty of earplug choices, so even though the default hurt my ears, I found a pair that was very comfyCons:- FM radio has almost no reception. I live in a city with a few radio stations, and I can only pick up one of them. That's it, one station!- Always loses reception of bluetooth. It my phone is on my left side (armband or pocket), it loses the connection regularly.- The flexible band connecting the ears, often snags on my skin, when I turn my head- Though the buttons are easy to find/adjust, the main play/power button is situated so that when you press it, you drive the right earpiece, deep into your ear. Often uncomfortably.They are definitely on the right track here. I love that Jabra has several specialty lines of headsets, but I still feel like we are a couple of generations off from something I'll really like.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FVNHBI" id="B005FVNHBI-review86" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-10:</strong> Since the very first time I got a pair of wireless headphones I became a &#34;cables hater&#34;, so I have gone through different &#34;phases&#34;. I started with the JAYBIRD's first generation (which kept failing so many times and I kept making the warranty valid so many times that I REACHED THE THIRD GENERATION! STAY AWAY OF THEM!). Then I found the &#34;Plantronics Backbeat&#34; which are really good, great sound and features, decent price, eventually they got broken (my fault). Finally I got these ones, JABRA SPORT, which are very good but have definitely issues: THE YELLOW BAND THAT HOLDS THE TWO AURICULAR, IT'S NOT SWEAT PROOF, and KEEPS STICKING TO MY BACK NECK SKIN, VERY ANNOYING. IF YOU ARE OUTDOORS, YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR MP3 player UPPER ARM LEVEL or THE SIGNAL WILL KEEP BREAKING (this never happened with the Plantronics, I even run with my iPhone in my pocket and the signal was constant). BATTERY RUNS JUST FOR 3 hours (Plantronics, 7 hours).  Goodies: great design, very good sound, FM radio, stay in place when running, easy pairing. If the upcoming models of Jabra improve these issue, I'll stick to them when the time of a new pair comes.

The small wall usb charge is great since it is small and takes up little space on the wall. The close able prongs makes it even smaller to fit in my back pack to take it to school and back. The matte black top is really nice and compliments the glossing side(s) finish. On the other hand the car charger is also amazing. It is also small in fact too small, as when i plug it in to the car charger it goes all the way it to the edge of the plug making it very difficult to take out  of the car charger slot in the car and that is why i rate it a 4 stars out of 5. Besides that it is awesome! With its two (2) usb ports it is great for a car. I love the glossy finish but it does scratch easily as i have multiple small scratches on it already.

Those scratches were a constant reminder how I permanently scratched a brand new phone.During installation, be to be generous with the spray.  After cleaning your hands very well, spray your fingers on both hands with the solution provided as suggested and both sides of the shield very well and you will find it easy to position and reposition a dozen times until you get it on there perfectly and without debris or fingerprints.  You then use the included squeegee to push out the air and water bubbles (and for the next few hours I used the back of my fingernail to keep pushing them off to the side and out).  The instructions say to give it 3 days for the impefections to completely work themselves out, but even after 6 hours I am seeing a marked improvement.I have found myself wanting to clean it often.  Grime seem to stick to it very easily.I ordered the SteinheilSGP HTC Thunderbolt Screen Protector Steinheil Ultra Series [Ultra Crystal] shield for my wife's phone.  The differences:Steinheil includes 2 shields in a nice thin pack vs 1 in a big box for ZaggSteinheil has a hard, scratch and scuff proof surface!Both seem equally crystal clear straight on and the Steinheil even from an angle.Steinheil was more difficult to install and get it bubble and dust free (unless you knew the trick before hand AND had a sharp enough eye to get it on the 1st try)The 3 dollar discount code on the zagg website is ijailbreakThe zagg website has a video demonstrating its scratch proof qualities which showed me that their understand of the term was quite different than mine.  It showed them using a Dremel to mar the shield and then they took the shield off to show that the glass itself was not harmed.  My interpretation would have been that the shield itself was scratch proof.  Using their definition, I may have to replace the screen every few months.  In fact, after only 24 hours, I have already permanently scratched the soft shield, probably by sliding it against that plastic credit card holder.Since it does scratch so easily, I knocked off a star for not throwing in a 2nd and 3rd shield.  It seems a complete waste of money and packaging to just have 1 shield per this big box with a bottle of water inside.  Considering how many people have more than one phone to cover (as was my case) or may want to replace it every time it scratches or a corner lifts off and collects debris, there should be an option to have a 3 shield version for $2 more.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004SCQO1U" id="B004SCQO1U-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-08:</strong> These are a must have for any electronic device with a screen.

ACTUALLY, it's great. I've dropped the phone a couple of times (small distances) and there have been no breaks, or cracks or problems. The "rubberized" coating is just that... a coating. It's pealing off, but the hard plastic case behind it is just a semigloss black color, so I'm not worried about it. Not a great quality finish, but a very durable case. If you only need it for protection, and not asthetics... it's the case for you. It will keep the scratches, bumps, and drops from reaching your phone. Fits perfectly, has all the proper cut-outs, and openings, and slides right onto the phone.

The &#34;dirt&#34; is really just blue dye from putting the phone in and out of my jeans pocket.  I haven't found a way to clean it from the cover.

For starters it really does offer a reasonable amount of protection with a more slimmed down look and feel than most competitors. The construction is friendly for the most part. The port coverings are a little cumbersome to deal with but I just sliced them off along the edge. My one and only gripe about this case is that it flirts with having exceptional grip but doesn't quite hit the mark. It has a bumpy feel and is less smooth than the back, both good starts. But I'm not one of these people who complains about sliding a phone in and put of my pocket with the ease of water off a duck's back. No. Im an adult and I put a premium on NOT DROPPING the phone and not getting hand fatigue. So overall this is a wonderful option for those who are drop prone and want a slimmed down version of say an Otterbox by comparison. I treat my phones very well and am not a careless phone user, so I tend to switch out cases based on mood and grip and not protection. This would be a great case to use during travel or vacations. I really wanted this to be THE ONE.

I did need the double sided tape. Guitar picks are useful, but I already have a box of those. I needed several to  wedge under the old glass, though I guess you could wedge credit cards in there. I used a hair drier. There is a good 2 part YouTube video on how to do this. Plastic razor blades were recommended. I went to Home Depot and Lowe's. They never heard of plastic razor blades. Like a lot of things you attempt for the first time, things seem to get out of hand. I thought I ruined the phone. But I got the old glass off. Then the sticky stuff that was between the glass and the screen...was this supposed to be removed? I had no idea, but it was half removed with the glass I took off, so I removed the rest of it. The video is essential for reattachment of the buttons on the bottom of the screen , left and right, with the double sided tape. I removed all of the original double sided tape all around the perimeter. I applied new double sided tape all around. There was a different video I had watched that had application of the double sided tape a little bit different, so I do recommend watching as much videos as you can in order to have a better feel for doing this. Anyways, I cleaned the display off, took the backing off the double sided tape and set in the new glass. It looked good. At first the screen did not respond. I heated it and pressed down all around. It is now working and looking like new. It does not say Samsung on it. Why should it? Samsung did not make the glass. Is it Gorilla glass? Probably not. But if the original was Gorilla glass then why did it break? I am not concerned now, because now that I have done this repair, I know the ropes. I could do it again much faster. 5 stars because it was inexpensive and has my phone as good as new. This repair is entirely doable for anyone who is reasonably mechanically inclined.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00D5P2W3U" id="B00D5P2W3U-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-14:</strong> With 3 teenagers and 5 smartphones in the family, we go through a decent bit of screen glass.

It happened when my recliner &#34;ate&#34; my phone and end up pinching the side.  I am normally not that hard on my phone and as I am a little tech savy I decided to change my phone myself.  The instructions provided were good and the tools helped out.  The most difficult part is trying to get the current's phone's glass to start to remove after that it is easy.  One thing I would say with the instructions is that you it doesnt mention what the entire glass looks like.  I started remove the glass however you have also remove the backside which is beyond the blue samsung plate as well.  After I removed that I was able to replace the glass.  The reason why I gave this kit 3 stars is because the glass lasted a week and a half before it somehow cracked from just being in my pocket.  I did nothing that I haven't done a million times before.Pros:  Good Instructions, useful tools.Cons:  Glass is not very sturdy, broke after 1 1/2 weeks</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00D5P2W3U" id="B00D5P2W3U-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-22:</strong> Great product.

It is such a shame because I was so excited about this charger. For the price I paid I wish I would've gotten something that WORKED.My first review for this product is above.  I originally gave this product 2 stars, but bumped it up to 4 stars because of the customer service! I emailed the company about the situation I had encountered with the chargie and they were so attentive.  They heard me out and sent me a new wire and attachments for FREE.  When the wire and attachments came in the mail I immediately tried it out and it confirmed my original problem.  The wires I received before were the problem and was not charging my chargie correctly. Now that I have new working wires, my chargie works perfect! It lasts for so long and the wires work fine now!

In reality you need two different screwdrivers and hinge to push up the batter connection and actual battery, that is it. What I found here is lots of unnecessary stuff, no instruction manual and moreover cheap plastic hinges that starts to break if I use it to pull up the battery.The included flat head screwdriver did not even fit the screws to remove the battery connection, so essentially what is required was not even working.Battery performance is hardly at par with my 1.5 year old battery which I had to replace. With 3G on, it gets fully discharged by 5 pm after overnight full charge.Two stars instead of one, just because the battery works, and for the pentastar screwdriver which is hard to come by.My advice for the company is to hold off the cheap unusable screen protectors, supposed to be microfiber cloth etc and just provide instrucitons and items that are of better quality.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B008EKWA9C', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B008EKWA9C', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B004UDRREK</h2>    <p class="price"> $B004UDRREK</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004UDRREK" id="B004UDRREK-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-27:</strong> I was really excited when it came in the mail so I hurried up,and put it on my phone the lights at the bottom off the iPhone case lit up a few times then I went home,and followed all the necessary instructions then plugged it up for as long as it was required for,then I put it on my iPhone 4s and it didn't work I pissed so never again will I purchase another backup battery case that's used lesson learned,I recommend you purchase a brand new one don't buy it used.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004UDRREK" id="B004UDRREK-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-12-03:</strong> The red color I order receives a LOT of a attention.  People tell me if I am holding it in the hallway their eyes track immediately to it.  If you have incipio's red feather case, this isn't the same color of red. :)  I wasn't expecting it to be exactly the same, but I was hoping it would be close.  It is more of a ferrari red, as someone put it, and it is glossy to boot! ;)The case feels like it will be just as slick as the iPhone 4S itself, but if I hold my hand open with the case and phone in it... and rotate to a 45 degree there is enough friction that it barely creeps out of my hand.While the battery does add some bulk, they have take the apple approach and rounded out the edges enough that if you hold this case in your hand, it feels slimmer than an iPhone with a bumper case.  I personally prefer the feel of this case (and the small additional weight) to that of the phone with a bumper on it.  The initial reaction I get when other see it, and find out that it has a battery it in, is "There's a battery in there?  It is really thin if it has a battery, how long does it extend your use time?"I have only had the case a few days at this point, but with my usage I am finding that if I press and hold the button to start charging the phone back up at 40% that I will get to 100%.  I haven't stopped using the phone, yet, however, while it was charging.  Generally I am still browsing the web or talking on the phone for about 15 - 20% of the time it is charging the phone.  I also haven't paid too much attention to how long it takes to get the phone that far... but my best guess would be it is about 1 hour.  I also haven't paid too close attention to the charging time of the case (I will generally deplete the case and then slip it off to charge it back up and keep using my phone with the incipio feather case).  It feels like it takes a long time, but I haven't really timed it, rough guess would be 1.5 hours to charge the case itself.I have charged my case with my old HTC EVO charger and used the same cable to sync the phone with iTunes through the micro USB cable.  So that is very convenient considering that most other electronics I own use the standard micro USB.  The case doesn't appear to be as picky as Apple about which charge it will accept... for example, in my car I have a USB charger from my jabra headset that the phone wouldn't charge from itself using an apple cable.  However, if I plug in the case with a micro USB into the same charger, the case will light up and start charging (the iPhone doesn't charge in this instance however).  The jabra charger is pushing out 5V 750mAh.  I purchased another charger which was for the iPhone 4S [...] which pushes 5V, 1 Amp and this will charge both the case and the phone (together or separate, meaning it will charge the iPhone 4S will the apple cable).Cannot comment on Protection as I haven't dropped the phone (with our without the case), and I hope I never do.  It does feel sturdy enough, however, to take a hit, just not a drop that is face down (see "minor issues" below).Minor issues:- I have an iPhone 4S so the ringer silencer is very close the edge of the hole as this case is for the iPhone 4 and apple moved the ringer silencer on the 4S.- the Flash is not usable while using the case as the hole for the camera/flash is so deep the flash comes back into the camera sensor and causes the picture to look washed out.- The hole for the flash and camera acts like a lint scrapper and picks up a lot of lint from my pocket.- Hole for the volume buttons is a little deep and makes it difficult to access them.- speaker is covered by the micro USB, but they appear to have a slot to push the sound out of the front toward the user... I haven't noticed a huge degradation in audio quality/volume however, calls on speaker and music through the speaker are still audible and plenty loud for me.-Case doesn't protect the front of the phone at all, if placed face down on a table, the screen would be resting on the table.-Glossy packaging (similar to the plastic on the back of the iPhone 3G/3Gs) make me feel like the case will look scratched up after some time (so far so good though over 1 week of setting it on tables in meetings and in restaurants and plenty of pocket insertions and removals.  None of that very harsh, however)Overall: Very slick looking case, especially for having a battery.  Highly recommend at this point if you are looking for a case that will give you a power bump to get your another 60% + of extra batter power in a slim design.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004UDRREK" id="B004UDRREK-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-11-28:</strong> The Incipio Offgrid caught my eye because of how thin it is... for $45 I think its a steal... retail at $70.

Probably will.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001G2JPVQ" id="B001G2JPVQ-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2009-12-06:</strong> My main purpose for getting this mount was to use NaviGone Navigation software on my iPhone, and I'm happy to report, this device has provided the perfect solution.When it arrived, and like others, I too thought it felt a little cheap.  Then you open it up and feel how dense the plastic is and realize this is a well made piece of equipment.The suction cup isn't a "lick and stick" like some, or like the kind you'd use for a radar detector.  This is the real deal with a compression clamp.  Hold it up to the windshield, push the clamp, and this thing isn't letting go of your windshield any time soon.I can rotate and the extension arm vertically or horizontally with ease while driving.  I love this device so much, that I just use it to hold my phone even when playing music.Finally, yes it holds your phone VERY tightly.  Tightly enough that you have to use a good amount of force to push it into the holder and then to get it out.  Frankly, since it's holding my $300 phone and who knows how much in apps, I'm kind of glad it does.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001G2JPVQ" id="B001G2JPVQ-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-07-10:</strong> I use this for holding my Iphone when in the car.

The extension arm is very short but that does mean it doesn't have a lot of movement like other brands have. It's a solid product.My only real issue is that it's a little difficult to get the phone in and out of the mount. If you have any type of a case this will not work for you. I now use an otterbox case and there is no way it will work with this mount, and to be fair it doesn't say that it will.This mount is a great mount only if you have an iphone 3G or ipod touch and don't have any type of protection on it. If you do you will want to look for another option.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001G2JPVQ" id="B001G2JPVQ-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2009-09-13:</strong> This product works well holding the I-phone in place.

I usually remove it on hot sunny days, and haven't had any problems getting it to re-attach. It holds the phone securely and has plenty of adjustment. The cradle comes apart creating two pieces so it fits easily in my luggage. Other models are out there that include a dock connector so you can leave your power and aux cables attached and just remove the phone, but cost more I'm sure. I don't mind attaching those manually each time; small inconvenience that trades off in size and weight for travel. Great product especially considering the price.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B001G2JPVQ', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B001G2JPVQ', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B009YNR7JG</h2>    <p class="price"> $B009YNR7JG</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009YNR7JG" id="B009YNR7JG-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-25:</strong> They were cut right to the phone size, no issues really.

Yes, when the screen is off, you can see a rainbow effect with glare. I don't see it as an issue or understand why anybody would. The other issue is smudging.

Feels pretty good, not exactly like the glass but much better than other protectors I have tried. Also lets you still use the s-pen without much difficulty.Edit: I have since increased my rating to 5 stars from 4. DBA cases has some amazing customer support.

I have always believed in using screen covers and have always installed them myself (dry applications only).I am VERY picky regarding my devices and especially my phones and as such I feel I have become very proficient in applying screen covers.  I have used ZAGG and Ghost Armour for devices (phones to tablets) prior to this and have been disappointed with several aspects (thickness of product, tacky almost sticky feel at times, orange peel effect, lint/dirt buildup on edges of screen, clarity of screen, fit in cases and docks that peel screens off.These screens were my first attempts at a wet screen install.Review: Just Like Glass Screen Protector - Samsung Galaxy Note 2Shipping (on both attempts) was up to high Amazon standards.  Received the product in my mailbox in a large envelope lined with bubble wrap.1st Attempt - Laid out product on wood table in dining room and gathered needed items: credit card, 3 microfiber cloths, bowl of water for fingertips.  Read the instructions thoroughly twice to ensure I understood all the steps.  The fist package came with a small see through bottle of liquid.  Cleaned phone with 1 squirt of liquid and microfiber cloth.  Washed hands and wet fingertips.  Removed screen cover from sheet and sprayed adhesive side with included liquid thoroughly (ran out of liquid-more on that later).  Placed screen on phone and slid into place.  This was the easiest screen placement install I have ever had as I did not need to get it perfect the first time because it slid into place beautifully.  I waited the 20-30 seconds as stated in the directions until screen did not move when lightly touched.  I started to remove the water/bubbles from under the screen pushing from the center toward the edges.  I noticed a bubble that would not go away and discovered that it was a dust particle.  I tried pushing liquid to the particle and then pushing it toward the edge but that method did not work.  I carefully peeled back the cover and tried to spray more liquid on it but there was not enough left in the small container.  I tried using some water from the bowl but when wet I could no longer see where the particle was.  I set the screen down again and tried pushing the liquid out the edges again but the particle was still there.  I then peeled the screen up and grabbed a piece of scotch tape as indicated in the directions.  I tried to use the sticky part of the scoth tape to remove the particle but the adhesive from the tape left marks on the screen and the particle still remained.  Frustrated to no end at this point I laid the screen back down and finished removing the excess liquid from under the screen.  Looking at the screen and knowing it was $13.00 plus dollars I tried to make myself ignore the particle now highlighted with sticky tape adhesive.  Pulled off the screen cover 30 seconds later and threw it in the trash.I researched the installation process and came across a review that indicated performing the entire installation in a bathroom type environment after a shower. The logic being that the humidity in the air will help prevent stray dust particles from affecting the installation process.2nd Attempt: I ordered a second screen cover and I attempted the same steps from my 1st attempt above except in a humid bathroom.  This time the liquid was shipped in a small black spray container.  Suffice to say I had the same issue with a dust particle getting in between the screen and the phone.  This time I tried to remove the particle solely by using water from the bowl of water for my fingers.  I could not feel the particle on the adhesive side of the screen and was relegated to just trying to wipe the particle off the screen with my wet fingers.  The end result was yet another particle in the screen that I could not live with and ended up throwing another $13.00 plus screen away.I ordered a regular pack of dry application screens and somehow managed to apply the first dry screen perfectly the first time without contamination from foreign objects.This product sounds great and I am sure that I would love it if I could apply it correctly.  I do not feel I am below average intelligence or dexterity level and have come to the conclusion that these screens are very difficult to apply.The only theory I have come up with after paying for and watching the installation of ZAGG and Ghost Armour screen covers 8 times collectively is that the people who apply those spray massive amounts of liquid during the installations, something that with the limited supply of liquid provided can not be achieved using this product.  Perhaps the installation would be aided by additional liquid being included or at least the option to purchase additional liquid.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009YNR7JG" id="B009YNR7JG-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-16:</strong> For the record, we did the instructions EXACTLY as shown, copious amounts of spray were used, a bowl of water was prepped for adequate handling was used, and we even took precautions such as a steam room to reduce the affect of dust.That said, one of the instructions listed were to use our fingernails to push out air bubbles.  However, in several instances, moderate to heavy pressure by our fingernails actually managed to scratch and distort the screen protector permanantly.  Additionally, even after about 2 weeks, there are these parallel running distortions along the face of the protector, essentially creating a warped effect when viewed from ANY angle.  On a bright/white screen the effect is minimal, but on a dark screen, such as during certain scenes in movies, the effect becomes annoyingly apparent.Additionally, the instructions state that during the week, twice a day, care should be taken to run your fingernail along the edges of the protector to better insure good adhesion, however, in our instance, this seems to have made things worse, as there is already signs of lifting and certain corners are peeling.That said, the one thing that we appreciate about the screen protector is the cut of it.  Though some may take issue with the fact that the screen protector is noticeably smaller than the actual screen and comes no where near to covering to the edge of the device (a feature that we take issue with during swiping from the edge functions as it exasperates the protector lifting issue) this actually helps when it comes to the proximity sensor.  In that regards, being cut so low helps us avoid accidental coverage of the sensor and prevents the issue of the screen remaining off during calls, an issue with another screen protector we tested that was the epitome of annoying.All in all, for the money, there are much better protectors out there, and this week we'll be testing some oleophobic protectors to see their performance.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009YNR7JG" id="B009YNR7JG-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-13:</strong> So far, so good.

Here's the story. I ordered a JLG Protector for my Note 2 the day I got the phone. My friend ordered a JLG protector as well when he heard of my recommendation. We both got our protector, and I ended up doing all the installs. My first protector had 2-4 bubbles that never cleared up (small on the side near the edge of the screen). 100% no dust below the bubble as I used a magnify glass to try to look for it. Installed my friends the exact same way. Same atmosphere...Friends protector, 100% clean, zero bubbles, almost zero haze after install!Talked to the owner of JLG on XDA forums. He offered to send me a replacement.Installed it today the same way I did it... 1 bubble near the center of the screen. Another one near the home button. Once again, zero dust! Same type of bubble where it looks like the adhesive had problems. Hundred of microscopic bubbles around the perimeter making it look like one bubble! From the looks of this, it won't clear for sure, even after 2 days.My conclusion? Either it's my fault, or it's a defect in material. I don't want to put all blames on the company, but I don't really know the cause of it. Adhesive seems to react a certain way with water solution which might have caused the bubbling? Or, could it have been the pressure I used when squeezing the bubbles out between the screen and the protector? Could the pressure cause the adhesive to go in directions that messes up the protector? I'm not too sure myself. You make your own conclusion.Guess, I'll just deal with the bubbling. Also, many have mentioned rainbow effect. I've posted a pic here on amazon with the rainbow effect. You can see it in certain angles in specific lighting. It's not a big deal since it goes away when screen is on. But if you stare at your phone in low light with the screen off, you'll notice it.I do want to say that the owner is very responsive if you contact him. The protector definitely feels very close to glass.Am I 100% satisfied? Well, service yes... As for the protector itself, not so much.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009YNR7JG" id="B009YNR7JG-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-07:</strong> It is smooth like glass, but leaves a residue rainbow under the protector that bothered me.

I am waiting for the day that I can upgrade to the new iPhone or android. If you are young, and you don't have a job, or lifestyle that requires you to be constantly sending and or receiving emails, and that only, this is not the phone for you.  On the other hand, if you do need a phone solely for business, and it is more high tech than the old blackberries, than this is the phone for you!What I hate about this phone is that, compared to the androids and iPhone's, there are not many social media outlets, and when I get bored there are no games that I can play. Yes, I am young, and I would like to play a game or two in the middle of a lecture.Games and social Medias are not the only horrible thing about the apps; all of the apps that are compatible with blackberries do not work very well. I once bought a map app, and it was horrible. The connection was slow, and unreliable, and I got lost in a neighborhood. After getting that app I just got the two social media's that I wanted, Twitter and Facebook, which are still very slow, and never returned to the blackberry app store. I can never trust any app to come out of there.Another Con of the phone would be that when you take video's, you cannot send them in any type of message, such as email and text, only straight onto YouTube, which is a horrible setting because you may not have a YouTube account, or may not want your videos to be on the internet.The keyboard. Yes, sure, there is a touch screen, but there is not a keyboard on that touchscreen, and the keyboard that is built onto the phone is tiny. But when trying to type on this; it took me months to learn how to hold the phone correctly. The buttons were made for babies, they are too small, and the only way to get a message to another person is to use the very tip of your thumb nail. If you want a phone that is easier to type, and not have to twist your mind and body to try and send a simple message out, do not get this phone.Another con of this horrible phone is that the internet connection also is horrible. You may have the best connection in the world, and it still won't upload the page, or information you need from the internet because it takes 5 minutes for everything to load. And once everything is loaded and the phone knows what it is doing, the checkers pop up on the screen, which means that the phone is still trying to upload more information from the website. The Wi-Fi connection is horrible. It may speed up some of the internet searching, but ultimately it still take a few minutes, instead of moments for the website to fully upload.Sure, the phone can be great if you are a business person, who only needs a smart phone to send emails quickly and efficiently, but other than that this phone is a piece of crap, and I do not recommend any person to get this phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005HYU1YE" id="B005HYU1YE-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-03-03:</strong> It was contract renewal time, so visions of new phones for myself and my family danced through my head.

Useless gimmicks like `Siri'I decided to stop, take a breath, and decide what I truly needed in a PHONE. I had 160 apps on my Droid and I literally used about 10-15 of those. The rest were part of the 'pissing contest' ("Hey, do you see what my phone can do!? Bro-stache! Voice warping software! 3D games!")I needed 100% accuracy in texts and emails. Clear phone calls. At least a workdays worth of battery life (10 hours of heavy usage). Contacts and calendar sync with gmail. `To do' list. The ability to handle multiple email accounts, including Exchange. A simple, decent camera. Medical apps like Epocrates. Music apps like Pandora, Shazaam, Slacker radio. Utilities like Evernote, Dropbox. You get the idea. Mostly as a functioning phone, a real phone with organizing tools, but with a few entertainment things.First let me say that it is truly a beautiful phone. Slim, sleek, stunning design. One of the best LOOKING phones ever. The touch screen is vivid, crisp, and clear.Now, about my `needs' from my PHONE.Accuracy. I am a physican at a busy hospital and we communicate with each other EXTENSIVELY via text throughout the day. The main problem I'd had with my Droid Incredible was the virtual keyboard. If I spent an hour a day texting, literally 15 minutes of that time would be erasing incorrect 'auto corrections'. My thumbs will never get smaller, I will always hit the wrong keys on a virtual keyboard. I had several keyboards on the Droid with very sophisticated prediction software, learning the words I used most, etc. It will never be good enough. iPhone keyboard is far worse, with absolutely horrid options for customization. Blackberry 9930 keyboard is the best thing I've ever typed on. I've never used a BB before but I took to it instantly.Instead of BB's stupid Bold commercial showing bicyclists with glow-in-the-dark wheels driving around, they need to show me at the hospital smashing my virtual keyboard phone against the wall....then cut away to me smiling as I discover what typing on a phone can be like. Stunning. If texting, emailing, and accuracy are important to you, don't underestimate this keyboard as it truly separates this phone from anything else available.Clear, loud phone calls. EXCELLENT noise reduction. People hear me and I hear them. Perfect.Battery is decent. BB users are not thrilled because they are spoiled with 2 days of use in their old, slow, no feature phones. This thing is fast, with a brilliant screen, and it needs juice. I am thrilled with it because I come from the land of Droid where you have to charge the phone multiple times per day. It gets me through long days. I bought the extra battery with dual charger from Amazon, but I have not had to use the second battery yet. There's a HUGE extended battery available, but it makes it look nuts. Some people don't mind, but I love the sleek look, so I will never get that.Syncs with gmail, contacts, calendar. Not as smoothly/thoroughly as Droid devices, of course, but it works very well.Multiple email accounts no problem. POP, IMAP, Exchange.LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the camera! It doesn't have `auto focus' it has some sort of way to focus on everything at the same time. Forget what they call it? IT DOES NOT TAKE CLOSE-UP PICTURES WELL! So, if you are buying your phone with a need for close-up photos, this phone will not suit you. The dedicated camera key is soooo convenient. Why is this not on every phone? Fast, clear, fun to take pictures.BB app world has an atrocious set up. It's confusing, some apps are not represented in BB app world, you have to go to the developer web site to get many programs, app world constantly signs you out when you are browsing on the computer, etc. But most of the major apps are available, and they work fine. Everything I need is available. You too will be fine with apps, it will just take a little digging. App world needs some work.OH, one of the things I love the absolute most about this phone is the INSTANT UNIVERSAL SEARCH! Start typing and the phone starts searching your apps, your texts/emails, contacts, etc for matches. You can set it up so it searches just the things you want it to search. It's amazing and it's INSTANT. It's better than iPhone's swipe (that's already an extra step), and type (on the virtual keyboard that sucks), and it includes INSTANT WEB SEARCHES AS YOU TYPE VIA BING!! Amazing. (As an aside, I love google search and I think you can set it to that, but I'm finding Bing's TV commercials are pretty accurate. I'm getting too much irrelevant information on google. Bing is pretty impressive.)I suggest you sit down and write out what you need from your phone. This BB will NEVER beat iPhone and the latest Droids for speed, apps, screen size, gaming. But, it doesn't need to because it's a better PHONE.Love this phone. My wife got the Galaxy Nexus as did one of my sons. My other boy got an iPhone 4S. I feel that my choice is a better actual functioning phone. I LOVE IT. However, I won't win the `pissing contest' as they are downloading the latest 3D Magic 8-ball app.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005HYU1YE" id="B005HYU1YE-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-13:</strong> Loved this phone but was missing the sim card which I think made the call reception a little weak, the other blackberry's that I had did not have this problem.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005HYU1YE" id="B005HYU1YE-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-20:</strong> I've always had Blackberries but when I was getting a new phone, I thought I'd get an Android or an iPhone. I had the Android for two weeks before I couldn't stand it anymore and returned it for this Blackberry. People bash Blackberries all the time but almost none of those people have actually owned a Blackberry. No, Blackberries are not great for web browsing or apps, this is true. BUT they are great for email, which is 90% of what I do on my phone. I can't imagine a better keyboard than the BB. Features like holding down a letter to capitalize, shortcut keys to find a particular email, sound profiles so only one or two email boxes vibrate/ring while the others stay silent.... these are so fantastic and not to be found on any other device.I'm giving this phone 4 stars instead of 5 because it's become a battery suck (unlike previous versions so I imagine it has something to do with the ridiculous touch screen) and it's physically bigger than previous models. I think the trend is towards bigger, more tablet-y phones so maybe RIM just wanted to join in on that but personally, I would have preferred something smaller.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005HYU1YE" id="B005HYU1YE-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-04-06:</strong> This latest feature of the RIM BB Bold series is fully loaded with the features provided both through upgraded hardware and from the BB OS 7. It is lighter, faster, packed with upgrades (like better keyboard, touch-screen, faster processor, etc.), better battery life and it will make you enjoy the BB better than its predecessors in the line and also stands out against other models in comparison.You would definitely enjoy this unlocked version as it will also be fully compatible to your communication needs when travelling (for those corporate-kind) and being in contact with your BBM-list. It has some flaws but with most of the upgrades provided these seem minor as the pros stand out and brings more to the user who would be more than pleased.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005HYU1YE" id="B005HYU1YE-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-22:</strong> This blackberry is excellent but the battery life is weak so exchanged for a 9780.

It strikes a great balance between touch screen capabilities and physical keyboard. The 9930 is absolutely beautiful, I don't know how else to describe it. It looks like it was designed to the ultimate executive. The keyboard is awesome to use. I've had a Galaxy S4, Galaxy S3, Iphone 5 and Iphone 4S this year. While the 9930 does not have the specs of those phones, the Blackberry OS7  integrates so well with the phone hardware that you won't notice any lags in performance. You're not going to be able to play Infinity Gauntlet or any of the higher-powered games, but chances are you don't really care about that if you're looking at a Blackberry 9930. The 9930 is amazing at what it's supposed to do, which is a communication device. It's not pretentious.If the iPhone is the Lexus of smartphones, and the Galaxy S series is the Mercedes, then I would say Blackberry is the Audi of Smartphones. I would recommend this phone to any professional looking for a streamlined device aimed at productivity.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005HYU1YE" id="B005HYU1YE-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-28:</strong> The phone arrived on time and in good shape. Its my constant companion, just love the neat size and most of all the ease of use.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005HYU1YE" id="B005HYU1YE-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-08-31:</strong> I feel for you Verizon customers who have been waiting to upgrade your Blackberries - especially if you wanted a touchscreen BB.  Since RIM never released the Torch 9800 for CDMA users, you guys never got to experience that goodness.  Surprising since the Torch is (was now, with the release of the Torch 2 and the new 9850 for Verizon) one of the few decent releases from RIM in the past couple of years.  Anywho - with the 9930 Bold, those who were left out finally have a reason to upgrade their phones.For those of you who are wondering - this is NOT the Monaco phone that RIM plans on releasing soon.  That phone is fully touchscreen - designed to replace the much hated Storm and not too much better Storm 2.Ok, so some list of changes that RIM brought about:- With the release of this Bold, RIM decided to nicely go back to the old style Bold 9000 keyboard.  The keys are a bit bigger, so for those of you whose fingers might have been too big for the Bold 2 that was released for Verizon, I urge you to give this phone's keyboard a try - you'll be pleased.  Some of you may notice the dimensions of the 9930 and the 9700 are very close, so you might wonder how they got the keyboard bigger.  Well, they did it by getting rid of the plastic lining around the sides of the phone.  Yes - both the keyboard and screen are now flush with the edge of the phone.  I'm not sure I'm a fan of this, as it makes it a whole lot easier to crack/break something important, but it seems to be a direction most phone manufacturers are moving in, so we'll see....- This phone is the first to have the new 7 OS - which is nice, but I think I'd rather have the QNX OS, thank you very much...  Haha - but it is a good OS - for those who are interested, it takes up less space than 6.  If my calculations are correct - about 15% less.  This OS also supports NFC (near-field communication), so it'll be interesting to see what kind of apps developers create to take advantage of it. (For those who remember it - NFC is how Google Wallet works) Voice search also works particularly well with this OS, and two new business apps are included, called BlackBerry Protect and Balance. Protect allows your business to remotely monitor, configure and wipe, if necessary, a remote smartphone so when the phone disappears, your whole business life doesn't disappear along with it. And Balance separates business tasks from personal stuff on a BlackBerry, which helps avoid the possibility of confidential data accidentally being sent to all those shady contacts.....- Yes, the screen is touch capable.  It's actually pretty slick - especially considering how small the screen is, comparatively speaking, so it is usable in day to day operations.  It especially works well with the browser - for all those times you need to move the page around, or zoom in on something, or zoom out to get a better view of the entire page.  Are you going to play games with it??  Most likely not.  But it is a start.- "Liquid Graphics Technology": there's been alot of talk about this, and what exactly does RIM mean by it.  Here's what I can tell you, from my research and usage of the phone:  RIM basically put a separate graphics processor into the phone, which means that any of the graphics stuff should be a whole lot smoother and cleaner, since there's a distinct chip handling all of it.  From what I've seen, it is pretty fluid, but it still does get hung up at times - especially when it comes to certain web pages.  But overall, definitely an improvement.  I heard it's also designed to support 3D animations and games...Alright - enough of that.  Time for the good stuff - is it worth it??Short answer - absolutely.Pros:1) Battery life rocks.  I feel for all of you iPhone and Android users whose phones die in like a day.  This phone still keeps kicking after 2 days - without plugging it in once.  Add to that the ability to actually change your battery, and that I tend to carry a spare just in case, and I can go practically a week without having to charge my phone.  Incredible....2) Faster processor.  Thank you RIM, for finally adopting a processor that breaks the 1 GHz marker in a phone!  Actually RIM upgraded a bunch of hardware - like the memory, along with the ability to do NFC communications.  Thank you for reaching the 21st century RIM - we're happy to have you!3) Global phone - this phone supports both the GSM and CDMA networks, so it can be used internationally - a big plus for our corporate employees.  If you happen to travel internationally alot - don't worry, this phone's got you covered.4) Hotspot capable - this phone I believe is the first BB to natively support hotspots.  Yes, there are apps you can download for the other phones, but you usually have to pay a decent amount (the cheapest I can remember is around 35 - 40 bucks)  This supports personal hotspot right out the box, and it does support N-type speeds.Cons:1) Apps.  Actually - it's not what you think.  It's not about the amount of apps - it's that quite a few don't work with OS 7 right now.  Though this will be corrected as the OS matures and becomes more available.2) Screen resolution - which still comes in at 640x480 pixels and 287 dpi.  It's not bad - but I was hoping to get a qHD screen on a BB soon....3) No 4G - this does annoy me greatly.  4G, especially on Verizon, is starting to get decent, and to not have that ability on this phone??  I get the fact that it's a battery hog, but with BB battery life's so good as it is, I can't imagine it detracting from it that much.Honestly - what's been holding RIM back is their lack of upgrading the hardware.  They always seem to be a year behind the phones of the present.  They finally do some catching up with the 9930.I'll update this review as I use the phone more - feel free to ask questions or correct me, since I'm sure I forgot something!!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005HYU1YE" id="B005HYU1YE-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-04-09:</strong> Works all over the Caribbean and SA.

I use it as a back up phone and is a very reliable device. The Seller was great and very helpful. However, the one beef I have is that I've been using this phone for about two months now, and I've noticed that the battery doesn't hold a charge. May get a new battery, so be expecting an update on this matter. Also, when I purchased this phone from the seller, I received it with a 3rd party charger, so I'm hoping that it didn't ruing the phone. Again, will update on this matter once battery and charger are replaced.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005HYU1YE" id="B005HYU1YE-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-16:</strong> My first Blackberry was a 9650 back in 2010 on Verizon. While even at the time it wasn't the 'in' thing it was definitely a solid phone that did what it was made for really well. This one is no exception and it does it all even better.Caution. Phone carrier rant ahead: Anyone with half a brain knows that the large phone companies are completely screwing us over with the price of using a phone. You know how much it costs them for you to send a text? ZERO. You know how much it costs  them for you to send 5000 texts? ZERO. I promise you it doesn't require $30 a month for them to keep your 2GB or less of data running either. I bought this phone partially because I wanted to switch to Straight Talk but I still had a couple months left on my Verizon contract that they rape you for if you cancel early. With this unlocked phone I was able to stay on Verizon's CDMA network until my contract was up then easily switch it over to Straight Talk (which is basically the AT&T; GSM network) by putting in the SIM card and just switching the system on the phone to GSM. For anyone interested, Straight Talk is a pay as you go plan that's $45 a month and it's unlimited everything. No contracts, etc. It worked without a hitch. End Rant.The phone itself I think is very underrated and under priced for such a high quality product. It's basically the same build quality as the iphone 4s or iphone 5. It's plenty fast and does what you like without any lag. For anyone having issues setting up email or accessing the web on the data connection, you have to activate the phone and wait for your carrier to basically tell the phone that it's okay for it to connect with them. This can take up to 24 hours after activating your phone. If it doesn't, call your carrier and they should be able to get you up and running. My only problem with the hardware of this phone is the battery. Compared to other basic phones and other blackberries it doesn't last as long due to the faster processor. I suggest buying a second battery just in case. They're only about $8 here on amazon. Overall you're getting a lot of phone that can keep up with a lot of the other smartphones out there for a MUCH lower price. I'm not disappointed in any way.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B005HYU1YE', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B005HYU1YE', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B002BDU7UM</h2>    <p class="price"> $B002BDU7UM</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B002BDU7UM" id="B002BDU7UM-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-02:</strong> we should file a claim... fraudulent productchineese dungcan Mophie be suedcan Mophie be suedcan Mophie be suedcan Mophie be sued</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B002BDU7UM" id="B002BDU7UM-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2009-06-11:</strong> The highlights based on owning the black case.

The case is two pieces, the bottom 3/4 is the battery, the top 1/4 is a cap. Thickness is about doubled, and the phone is extended a little bit.

We all know perfectly well that the Apple iphone has a terrible battery life, right?  I see people complaining about this all the time and I wonder why they don't do something about it, it is so very simple, you just have to go and buy a Mophie Juice Pack Air Case and Rechargeable Battery!Then you never have to worry about being caught without any juice AND it has this beautifully designed case that is sleekly contoured to the Iphone and it adds no noticeable bulk or weight to the phone, which most people I run into seem to be worried about.It slides right in the case, and has a charging port at the bottom, with a mini USB, which comes with it, and it has no issues with syncing with itunes at all.It would be great if Mophie made a little dock for this, its the only thing I really miss having this on my phone 24/7 but that peace of mind it brings me doesn't out weighs this very minor inconvieance.I must also mention that their customer service is hands down the very best I have ever encountered, and that's a pretty big deal coming from someone who knows a thing or two about that!A very small investment for the power you may desperately need one day!I highly recommend this product hands down one the very best iphone accessory I have!I ALSO HAVE TO NOTE THAT THIS THING CAN ACTUALLY SAVE YOUR LIFE.

The Mophie has by far the best design. And it performs as advertised, boosting my usage by double.Here's the down side:1. Heavy. Man, is this thing a brick. But I need the extra battery life badly enough to put up with it.2. Fit and Finish. Had to return one because the top didn't line with the bottom on the right side. It stuck out so far you could tell it was an accident waiting to happen. The replacement's fit wasn't much better, but I no longer feared it getting snapped off during use. If the left side could line up so flush, why not the right, Mophie?3. Hot. When you switch on the battery to charge your phone, it gets substantially hot. Worrisome.4. Unique plug. The Mophie cord is actually sturdier than the Apple iPhone cord but I would have liked to have had the option to use my original cord. Plus the small plug on the Mophie end wiggles a bit too much for my liking.Thus the 3 star rating. Good.

I thought about replacing the battery myself which I have done before with my older iPod, but this time I don't want to open it myself and decided to get the Juice Pack instead.BATTERY CAPACITY (just a tad lower than the original battery):Original 3GS battery = 1219 mAhMophie Juice Pack = 1200 mAhGood for 500 full rechargesIt comes with a micro USB cable to connect to a PC or a USB power adapter. You can either charge the juice pack alone or have the iPhone in it and charge them together.  The Juice Pack instruct the iPhone to use the spare battery first before using the iPhone own battery; so, once the Juice Pack battery is exhausted, you still have a full battery on your iPhone.  There is a standby button at the bottom if you want to do it manually.My initial response when I slid the phone was that there is a gap at the bottom, that it doesn't have a nice fit.  I found out later that that was designed to avoid blocking the speakers.BULKY:Bulkiness is the main complaint.  But I am used to my Otter Box iPhone case; it is another type of case that is bulky but without the extra battery.  The Otter Box has an extra protection as it comes with built-in screen protector,  bezel around the screen, and silicone wrapped hard plastic shell.  The bezel interferes a bit when you are typing close to the edge like the letter "p" and the number "0", which is hardly the case with the MophieIt is nice.  I got the white one which is pretty but more prone to scratches and smudges.Mine didn't affect reception as others have noted.If you don't want to do surgery on your phone for a new battery, or you don't want to spend $$ to have it professionally serviced, then I can recommend the Mophie as the best next solution.PROS:- doubles the battery capacity- can sync with iTunes without the need to remove the Mophie case- sleek lookingCONS:- less of a protection as compared to Otter Box- bulky and heavy- Accesses to buttons are more difficult.  You need to use your nails to reach the buttons that are now recessed.- slippery smooth</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B002BDU7UM" id="B002BDU7UM-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-29:</strong> This morphia case was too small for my phone had to send it back .

I only had one tiny spec of dust keeping my install from being perfect. But I didn't feel like redoing at the time. Still has worm hole looking lines all over.  I will give some days to disappear.  Seems too soft unlike the cover T-Mobile gave me for free on my old phone which had a hard, glass like feel... smooth.  But this one seems to show prints and smudges less.  I don't know, why should choosing a nice screen protector be this hard?Update:After 3 days the worm hole looking scrapes are still visible although slightly less.  I think they came from using the squeegee.  Also has the slight orange peel effect and slight ripples on the edges where my cover contacts it.  I would have expected the protector to be perfectly clear and smooth by now.  On the plus side, I do like the touch and swipe feel (I have short nails) and it does seem to resist smudges and finger prints better than others I've had. But if the lines do not disappear, I may need to look for a replacement.  I want something that mimics the glass better.2nd update:After another couple days indentations and scrapes still don't seem to be going away.  Material too soft IMO.  Can't imagine carrying in pocket with even a credit card.  I lowered review a star and will look for a replacement.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BI3NKEG" id="B00BI3NKEG-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-15:</strong> The fitment is perfect and takes up the entire HTC One screen.  The product comes in a fantastic package (Thanks Skinomi).  I mean if I could rate this alone on presentation, these guys would get a 5 out of 5.Aside from that, this product feels similar to other wet application skins that i've used over the years on my different android devices.  I normally perform the wet installs in the bathroom with the shower on to minimize the amount of dust in the air.  The install was pretty easy.  Wash hands, clean screen, spray the back of the screen protector, peel it off spray the sticky part with solution, apply slowly while removing bubbles, soak up any extra solution with provided cloth, and done.This skin feels like it's going to protect your screen from serious damage, and that's always a bonus.  It doesn't feel as rubbery as some other skins that i've used, but it still feels like a similar material.  Maybe i didn't apply my screen properly, but I did notice a good amount of the orange peel effect.If you like the wet install screen protectors, then don't pass this up.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BI3NKEG" id="B00BI3NKEG-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-28:</strong> Pros: Great clarity, easy install, arrived on time, attractive packaging, very responsive to touchCons: scratched easily, fingerprint/smudge resistance only marginally betterI bought this and was at first fairly happy with the product, other than the smudge resistance being only marginally better at best it was still seemingly a good product and had a perfect fit. However, after only 2 days of normal use (no abuse) I noticed scratches which would not wipe or buff away on the screen. I am unsure if maybe this protector was missing the Oleophobic Coating or what may have been the case, but if not for this issue, i would have been one to give this a 5 star rating.Meanwhile, I am waiting to be contacted back regarding a replacement. If i receive one and it is any different, i will be posting an update to this review. I reviewed Techskin for the HTC One as well and the first product a received was indeed just a defect. I will say that Skinomi was quick to send a replacement, and the the product was received in better condition the second time around.Update: 5/5/2014I received a replacement today. After testing it out, I must say I am VERY pleased. Less smudgy, though still not smudge proof and it seems that what smudges I do leave on the screen shrink/repel and disappear over time... very cool! The clarity is awesome, and I might say the clarity is actually better. I just took my keys to the screen to see if the scratch resistance was any better, and yes. I don't see this one scratching under normal conditions.Most importantly, Skinomi stands behind their product. They haven't made it where I felt there was too much red tape. Other vendors have wanted me to send their products back, which tends to take the whole process down a deep rabbit hole where as there never seems to be a resolution. Skinomi customer service promptly called me and sent my replacement by 1st class 2 day shipping. From the day I left my initial complaint, I received my replacement within a week.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BI3NKEG" id="B00BI3NKEG-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-15:</strong> This is the best screen protector I have ever used.

I want to say no this is not the screen protector you should spend money on. 1. They say it is premium HD clear screen protector. Well it is not. It clearly shows distortion and you go from an immediate clear screen to one that his distorted colors and a weird look to it. You can clearly tell there is a protective screen on your phone now and it is not a good look. There is nothing clear about this as I have gone through several different brands and have seen much clearer screen protectors. This one distorts the clear image that your phone originally comes with and leaves a funky image. This is very common with these spray and lay type protectors. The best ones are the ones that are pretty firm and you do not have to spray the solution onto them. 2. The quality is crap. Most of the people that reviewed this have never had experience with quality screen protectors before or they would not have rated this so high. Trust me people. There are way better options out there for you. Unless you are not a person that cares about the quality of your display then this will work for you. If you care about seeing the best image presented to you with ultimate clarity while having protection, look elsewhere. Either try a tempered glass protector or take the best route and just take care of the glass on your phone. This is a piece of junk screen protector and that's why it costs 5 bucks. Do not get this.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BI3NKEG" id="B00BI3NKEG-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-30:</strong> I bought this because of all the the high reviews.

I have used Skinomi in the past so I know the quality and all in one kit to do the install was well worth the price.  Please note this is a wet application screen protector. You get a bottle of solution to spray on the protector and device (even though some people tell you not to). In my opinion, wet applications are super easy to install. If you get dust under there upon installation, just remove it, spray water on it to remove the residue and apply on the phone. Use the supplied squeegee and micro fiber cloth to smooth out and squeeze out the water from underneath the screen protector and slide it AWAY from any speaker openings. This being a HTC ONE, where the speakers are facing up, be extra careful there. Just squeegee to the sides of the phone and have the micro fiber cloth catch any of the water. If it is misaligned or you are unhappy with it, you can simply slowly and carefully remove it and start over again, but remember to spray more solution on the protector and your fingers when applying.Bottom line, this protector fit the HTC to almost a to edge to edge. To the untrained eye you cannot see it, but I can lol.  The only negative is that you do not see the awesome true screen because of the protector. In some areas, there are fuzzyness, which I initially thought was left over water. But it was just the screen protector. It's a very minor thing. My wife forgot about it within a day of usage and day to day usage. But bottom line, it is protecting the screen and she can throw the phone in her purse (she does this and kills me because I baby my devices lol) and go on a whim.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BI3NKEG" id="B00BI3NKEG-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-02:</strong> As usual, the packaging of the Skinomi Tempered Glass is very thought of and professional.  You really know you're getting a quality product.  In terms of installation, what can I say - you've done one, you've done them all.  As long as you follow the basic rules of installing screen protectors you'll be fine.  You really need to take your time and make sure everything goes where it's supposed to be.  Once you drop it on the screen it's going to be very difficult to redo again without having some problems.  The Tempered glass is indeed thin and has a nice rounded edge to it.  My only annoyance is that the glass has some sort of noticeable grit.  My fingers don't slide as smoothly as I would hope.  I've used other brands of Tempered glass before and never encountered this issue. It feels like they forgot to put the oleophobic coating.  I'm hoping Skinomi gets back to me and resolves this.  I'm giving them a 5 stars for now but we'll see how the glass feels after a week or so, and how Skinomi responds.  I'm hoping it's just my specific glass.  I would still recommend it.EDIT: After several days the glass is still not smooth.  Feels a little gritty but there's nothing there that you can see.  It's really weird.

I also had no problems putting it on (no airbubbles!).  I have had it for around 6 months now and it's still looking perfect.  Some may complain that the screen protector is a little thicker and softer than the other cheaper protectors that are thin and hard, but these ones still look as good, although i am afraid they don't stay on as long though.UPDATE: I dropped my phone the other day in the parking lot of the YMCA. I don't use a phone case anymore so it fell around 4 feet to the cement.  It also landed on the only rock nearby screen first.  The phone's screen had cracks going all around where it hit.  I was devastated.  Later, upon taking the screen protector off I noticed this screen protector was torn, but my phone's screen was intact without any scratches!!!!  I should have taken pictures.Overall it was replaced by a cheap walmart screen cover after it torn, but a new Skinomi screen cover will be purchased soon.  I feel bad using the lifetime warranty since it did it's job and I always felt that I wouldn't be that guy who drops his phone... I am afraid that the other screen cover's won't protect my phone as well as the Skinomi by the simple fact they aren't as soft or thick.  I wish Skinomi would give you two in the package and that is my only complaint, in case you have problems putting it on.  With practice putting screen covers on phones gets easier, you could probably even pay that person at the mall kiosk to put this thing on for you as well.  I wouldn't get anything now other than Skinomi for my phones, unless i need temporary protection.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BI3NKEG" id="B00BI3NKEG-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-19:</strong> This is hands-down the best screen protector that I have ever had on a cell phone.

This product is very similar to, if not the same as, the products from BestSkinEver or InvisibleShield. You have to wet the skin with soapy water to apply it. After a few days, all the bubbles will be gone. I have been using BestSkinEver for more than ten years, yes more than ten years, on iPod, tablets, and phones.I am extremely happy with it.It is much cheaper than InvisibleShield, which has marketed a lot and sells very well.  They send the skins in envelopes. That is it. I have to prepare the soapy water and lint-free cloth. Now Skinomi provides all of them in less than half of the prices. I thought this is a bargain.I just have to make sure you clean the screen really well. Don't trap lints or dusts under it. But this is the same for all skin protectors. I remember the instruction from a long time from BestSkinEver and InvisibleShield to apply it in a steamy bathroom to reduce ther possibility of attracting dusts or lints.The reason I take one star off is that I see glue streaks on the surface. Though they are getting less and less visible and they are not visible once the screen is on, I never have this problem with BestSkinEver.I suggest you try it. The touch is better than hard platic screen protectors.

I've been installing their Screen Protectors on iPads, Nexus 4s, Moto X, Blackberry Z10's of my family members. They're hold up pretty well if you get the installation right - but eventually come off if you're one of those heavy users like my wife. And the lifetime warranty claim is a hassle - so never bothered.This is my first experience with their Tech Glass product. The installation went smooth, there are no bubbles and the feel of glass is far more refined than that of regular protectors. I can see there are some persistent marks at the top (where the glass starts) and these don't seem to be bubbles. I guess the plastic protector applied on the tech-glass (pre-installation film) was not done well.Will wait for a few days and reach out to Skinomi if they (marks) dont go away. Their customer service has always been top notch,Its a good buy though. Worth the extra spending when you invest in a 600 $ + phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BI3NKEG" id="B00BI3NKEG-review25" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-12:</strong> This is not the first time I have used this product, it's as good as the first one I use, a prefect fit to my phone.I love this product.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BI3NKEG" id="B00BI3NKEG-review26" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-02:</strong> Exactly what I needed.

They are always high quality and do a good job of protecting my screens. Here are my impressions so far on the HTC One:Pros:-Exact fit, actually covers edge to edge-Easy to install (helps the HTC One screen area is a square!-All installation items are included-Price is reasonable-Skinomi has an installation video on YouTube, watch it and installation will be easierCons:-Seems to reduce the touch sensitivity of capacitive buttons (probably more of an HTC issue)-Included installation squeegee can leave scratches so use it gently or just use the included cloth to push out the bubblesObservations:-Seems to attrack the same amount of fingerprints as the glass on the screen-Material is softer than some other protectors and scratches fairly easily (which I guess is its job)-There will be small bubbles trapped under the screen after initial installation. Be patient and these will go away in a few days-I suppose there is a risk of damaging your device when installing a wet screen protector but I've never had an issue. With the HTC One you can put some tape over the speaker holes when you apply the protector to prevent any of the solution from getting in the phone. Once it is lined up and all the large bubbles have been smoothed out, just remove the tape.Overall I really like this screen protector. It is easy to apply, does not really change the look or feel of the screen and it does a good job of protecting the screen.

It requires several efforts of spraying and getting your finger tips wet in order simply align the screen protector without bubbles and lints. There is not covering piece on the screen protector when you apply it. Once you rub your credit card to get rid of the bubbles, the screen protector gets scratched to the point of no rescue. Do not bother buying this product.

It's a tacky rubbery skin that seems to indent and take away the clarity of the screen. That's bad enough. Add the cumbersome install process and Skinomi starts to lose star-ratings. In the end, when it turns out this skin is not case friendly I gave up and decided to get a refund.I've installed 3-4 other skins on Samsungs. My preferred ones are PET plastic material. They are hard to the touch, not rubbery, and my iSmooth one for Note 3 and S3 were both case friendly. Some of my issues could have been with the M8 sleek design, but most of the hassle was with Skinomi.Since the instructions say to let this skin cure for 4 hours (really?) I'll try that, but it won't make the skin work better with my Spigen case. I doubt the dents picked up will evaporate either like the liquid used for install (realllly?) Stick to PET and all you'll need is a credit card to smooth out the install.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BI3NKEG" id="B00BI3NKEG-review33" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-22:</strong> Yes its a hard install.

It has survived 2 good drops to hard tile/garage floor... accompanied by a bounce... and completely protected my iPhone 4s.  No scratches or damage sustained to the case or the phone!  The case does add some bulk, and I've decided that this will be the case I use when I'm headed out and don't want to carry a purse.  The slot in the back really does a great job of holding your drivers license and a credit card.  I've also folded up cash and put it back there, and it's all held very securely. It is smooth to the touch with rubber at the corners and around the face.  It slides in and out of the back pocket of my jeans easily, and doesn't pick up any lint.The case fits the phone well... all the buttons work as they should. The opening around the flash doesn't interfere with the flash function.  One complaint is that the case is too bulky to be able to put it in my desktop docking station (JBL OnStage).  It's also too bulky for me to plug it in to the adapter which is built in to my Infiniti G35.  The case is also VERY hard to remove. But, I've managed to remove it a number of times with some effort.Overall this is a great case for using as a case/mini wallet.  I've decided to buy a smaller case for everyday use, that hopefully will also allow me to plug in to my docking station and car adapter without needing to remove the case.

I've purchased at least 4 of these.They're extremely convenient (they hold two cards). They also do a dynamite job of protecting my phone. I drop my phone while unlocking the door (30 inches). I drop my phone on asphalt when I get out of my car (30 inches). My phone falls off my desk. My phone flies out of bed when the alarm goes off. If you use a screen protector and this case, then your phone will be fine.These cases REALLY do hold two cards securely and snugly. Cards don't fall out. CArds are also easy to access.I am pretty hard on my phone and cases. I think otterboxes make me look like a clumsy klutz. I prefer the slimmer, sleeker look Speck offers. Each case keeps cosmetic appearance for AT LEAST 3 months. I usually grab a new case after 4 months (once the side wall cracks). If you're tough on your phone/case and you want a practical solution, then this is the case for you. The card slot is a must have for me. I don't carry a wallet, and this case prevents me from losing my license and credit card.3 to 4 months may not seem like a long time. Those who have used the speck candyshell without the card case know what I mean: cases get scratched/snapped. Repeatedly removing my phone from the case also causes the plastic to snap (cleaning or accessing the headphone jack).One note of caution: the case's 3mm headphone port works perfectly for Apple's headphones, but larger 3mm plugs may not make it. In order to insert these plugs, you'll need to pop your phone out. This is the case's only downside (in my opinion at least).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005T0DTOK" id="B005T0DTOK-review22" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-18:</strong> This case is great, it is more than I expected, it holds my items along with my phone.

After buying this case, my world changed for the better!I must say that many of the reviewers are right in saying this case is SO HARD to take off. Even after countless times removing it, it didnt get any easier for me.I had to basically bend my phone in half. I was scared to remove it, since I thought my phone might snap from my efforts. I even had to stick a pen in there and pry it off a few times.But lucky for me, I never really HAD to take the case off. It was SO useful, I always kept it on. I abandoned my bulky wallet, and just carried around my main cards in one convenient location.

I found it pretty easy to fit either 3 cards or 2 cards and a few bills into the money compartment which was very convenient as I hate carrying a wallet around with how bulky it is (not saying I have a lot of money, just that my wallet is annoyingly thick).The case itself is very sturdy and feels pretty thick in your hands, that's why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. It does provide great protection, but its bulky and I wanted something a bit slimmer.  I essentially traded a bulky wallet and slim phone for just a bulky phone, so it was a win but a small one at that.This case provided the relief I needed from my wallet frustrations, and overall was a great buy for the price. I would recommend it to anyone who needs about 3 cards on them at all times/1-2 cards and some cash or just wants good phone protection with the option to carry cards as well.Hope this helps!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B005T0DTOK', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B005T0DTOK', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B0057UAMQA</h2>    <p class="price"> $B0057UAMQA</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0057UAMQA" id="B0057UAMQA-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-09-20:</strong> love this case, thanks  work great on my evo 3d the best, would buy again this was my 3rd outterbox case my hero, evo and now 3d</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0057UAMQA" id="B0057UAMQA-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-28:</strong> this case has most of the same issue as most of the otter box cases, makes the touch screen less sensitive, makes it really bulky (and the phone itself is already quite big), and other minor problems.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0057UAMQA" id="B0057UAMQA-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-29:</strong> does what you need a case to do. protects the phone and does not block out ports just a small rubber flap over each</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0057UAMQA" id="B0057UAMQA-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-29:</strong> Pros:-Very protective case.-Works with the Evo V from Virgin Mobile(Reason why I bought this case)-Rubber grips everything and doesnt slip out of hands easily. The inner plastic case has a groove on the outer side that the rubber locks into keeping it from coming off.-Front built in plastic for screen doesnt reduce touch response in screen-Plastic covers over camera lenses keep lenses from getting scratches and doesnt seem to alter the picture quality from what I can tell.-Inner half of case has foam inside keeping the phone from hitting the plastic, And the thin part of plastic at the top above the earpiece does seem like its easy to break, But havent broken it myself yet even with a few drops under my belt.-Rubber flaps to cover all the ports and switches is definitely nice.-Buttons seem to be easier to press with fingers but dont activate in pocket easily.-Clip on holster works great as a prop to hold the phone standing up.Cons:-Outer lip around the screen is HUGE. I have problems trying to type P and Q and backspace with my huge fingers, but definitely will protect the screen if dropped.-Case takes some fiddling to get on/off, But after a few times of taking it off and putting it back on, It goes on easy and fast.-I have noticed a slight discoloration from the plastic on the screen. It is nothing major but after looking at the screen in and out of the case i can see a slight difference. it seems to take some of the brightness away.-Easily doubles the thickness of the phone, Which may be a bad thing to some people.Definitely a must have case if your out working all the time, where your phone can be dropped or bumped into constantly. This case WILL protect your Evo 3D/V.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0057UAMQA" id="B0057UAMQA-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-22:</strong> I love my otter box, just wish they sold otter boxes in a different color for certain cell phones.

I do like that part.  It's appearance is exactly as pictured in the images.  The only problem with this case is the slick silicone used to mold the outer case edge.  Other Defender series cases have silicone that is easy to grip.  Not in this case, it's hard to grip.  The entire outer case is hard and smooth, and it is very easy to drop the phone when removing it from the belt holsterthat I always use. I probably will return to using one of my other Defender cases, and give this one to my granddaughter to carry in her hip pocket or purse.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00842MB4Y" id="B00842MB4Y-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-16:</strong> This is my second iPhone Defender case.

On the other hand, if like me you want an nearly indestructible iPhone case and are willing to put up with a little more bulk, I highly recommend this case.

The case was a little hard to seperate in the beginning and there was no indication of hwere to start prying or where the best place to pry was without fear of breaking hte case. I had bouhgt three of these for three different phones, GALAXY S III, iPHONE 4S AND iPHONE 5, all of which fit great.  The only thing I would suggest is to offer the case with out the heavy duty belt clip case/holder.  None of the people who I purchased this for use a belt clip function and either put the phone in their pockets or purse and the clip which was very nice and rather heavy duty seemed like a shame to waste.  I am sure the company could offer the product for a couple dollars less with the option of no belt clip feature. Either way, the price point was very good compare to the retail store of almost twice the price. The screen is very clear and of sturdy construction which does not impede the use of the touch screens.  The case itself is of top quality and can take the day to day abuse.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00842MB4Y" id="B00842MB4Y-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-09-20:</strong> This was a gift for a friend. he was thrilled and swears by Otterbox and their quality.

The screen protector is easy to keep clean. Ordering it through Amazon I saved money and received prompt delivery of my order. Unlike other Otter Boxes I own it doesn't have the &#34;vanity opening&#34; to show off the iPhone apple logo. I feel it would detract from the antique flag design on the back. Speaking of the back, it is made of a smooth hard material, not rubber, as are many other Otter Boxes. While it may slide around on hard surfaces it is much easier to slide in and out of pockets and is easier to insert and remove from the included belt holster/stand.

I used this phone for almost a month and was impressed with the smooth functioning of the touch screen and ease of adding apps, ect. Where this phone lost 2 stars for me, and what eventually made it a deal breaker and made me return it was mainly two things. Tracfone has made its reputation on the ease with which you can keep track of the minutes and service days you use, which is very important to me. With this new system, they have not yet ironed out the app that allows you to do this from the phone screen, which negates the main reason I carry a tracfone. It seemed like I was losing some min and txt time every few days and I have no  idea how or why, (I had the data mode disabled and only made calls using google voice while on wifi, so I don't know how this was possible.Second, the wifi connection, as reported by others, is very weak and barely reaches 15-18 ft from our wireless router in our small, (1400 sq ft), home. I think  once these type of smartphones have been on the tracfone brand for a while longer and these issues are ironed out, we may try another one sometime down the line. Meanwhile, the LG840G does more than I need a cell phone to do, (watch video/read books/listen to music/basic web surfing/take basic video/pictures...and oh yes, make an occasional phone call).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FM7R1WG" id="B00FM7R1WG-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-12:</strong> This ZTE looks just like a fancy smartphone and offers the same features, but is SO much cheaper. I bought it and as soon as I charged it I was able to switch my existing tracfone phone number to this one. (See below for important catch).  I had to spend some time getting acquainted with all the features, and was able to set up my email accounts easily without all that log in data that usually takes some knowledge (of which I have none).  Lots of regular features, plus Bluetooth.  Data is easy, but reading from the net is small and awkward.It can be used in portrait and landscape position, just be turning the phone.  Easy to set alarms and also a bedtime clock that is faint but helpful at night.  Standard camera and video.Here's the big issue to watch out for:  when I transferred my phone number (which was super easy) it deleted the minutes I had left on my tracfone.  I thought both would transfer. TF was then a royal pain in the behind at this point, saying I had no minutes left, and my old phone became &#34;unregistered&#34; when I sent the new number over so I lost almost 200 minutes.  I was ticked and TF says there was no way to determine how many minutes were lost. (Really? Their computers can't tell? I didn't believe them)SO, my advice is to have your old phone (if you are using one in the first place) and CALL tracfone and have them activate manually.  Make them confirm your minutes and data left before you do anything.  Have both phones in hand when you call.Another warning: when you set up email, it transfers all your email contacts as well. I hated this as I have thousands of contacts and I'm not sure how to weed them out now.  So check first to see if that's an option you can avoid.  OR, set up a new gmail or yahoo account first on your PC and then use that for your phone email, if anything to make it less messy.I hope you find this helpful. Respond to this review if you have questions and I will get write back to you.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FM7R1WG" id="B00FM7R1WG-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-27:</strong> I wanted the cheapest possible smartphone plan for occasional use, and found Tracfone to be the way to go. I started with the 1200 minutes/texts/mb plan with a year of service so it won't expire too soon, and that was a good choice for me since I don't make calls often, and only use data for quick checks when I'm not on wifi.The phone is awful though. Google Maps crashes all the time and I can't use it. Browsing the web reminds me of the days of dialup, and it's purely because this phone can't handle it since I have very fast wifi at home. It works okay for calls, though when I switched, many people told me my call quality had dropped and they had a harder time hearing me. Both the cell signal and wifi signal are significantly reduced compared to other phones being used in the same place. I restart the phone before expecting to surf the web to at least start out fresh, but that just brings it from 'barely usable' to 'mediocre'.The camera is a piece of junk. Image quality is awful compared to any other phone I've used. The tint is always off, the images are grainy, and they never seem to focus well. Forget being able to snap a pic of something up close to research later, as any picture closer than 5ft has never came out in focus. This may be acceptable for instagram, but for anything else it's way sub-par.The only good thing about the phone is battery life. I mostly left it alone and once got 6 days on standby before it got to 10% battery. With my typical use, I get about 2 days. You really only get about 3 hours of heavy use, so if you are playing a game, surfing the web, responding to emails, etc. it will die pretty quickly, and this mostly seems to be due to having the screen on. I bought a spare battery for a few bucks which works great too, as a backup for traveling away from outlets.The trick I've found to making the most of Tracfone is to route your number through Google Voice. Since I take most of my calls at home by a computer anyway, I can just answer the calls on Google and not use any minutes. Texts sent via Google Voice are free also, but you pay for the ones received. Wifi is the key to limiting data use too, and I leave data off unless I am actively using it. This has meant that I can get by on about 2000 minutes per year which means I pay at most $200/yr for service.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FM7R1WG" id="B00FM7R1WG-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-12:</strong> I have had the ZTE Valet about a week. So far, all is okay except the wifi antenna appears weak. Otherwise, I would rate it 4.5 to 5 stars. You have to realize you are not spending $600 for a high end smartphone so don't expect that kind of phone. It is great for what you pay. The Play store has plenty of apps to customize your phone to meet your needs.  The bottom line is this is a low end smartphone for occasional use. If you do a lot of calling or send many text messages, Tracfone is not your best bet.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FM7R1WG" id="B00FM7R1WG-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-04:</strong> Works great as a phone. Runs on Verizon 3g network where I live and that is a great network in Southern California.I have WiFi issues with this phone. It doesn't seem to like my router. I tried creating 3 different networks, running different WiFi standards ( g, n and b) but it keeps disconnecting.  Connected well when I first bought the phone but after about a week that changed.  I can connect it to my Freedompop hotspot device (runs g) but my Netgear router is not a friend to this phone.As an Android device, this phone is a very entry level.  I have used a Moto G and Moto RAZR M and those devices are quick and smooth.  This phone is not that.  I didn't expect that so I wasn't as disappointed as other people.  If you buy this phone, just know that it is NOT a speed demon and that it will be laggy when you try running even basic apps.I took one star away for the laggy performance of the phone and one more for the WiFi issues I have had.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FM7R1WG" id="B00FM7R1WG-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-15:</strong> Have been a loyal Tracfone user / promoter for several years now. Was glad they finally had a Smartphone available in their lineup. My wife had a Smartphone through work and when she didn't have that anymore it was getting harder to get her used to the non-smartphones again. I got her one and the complaints ended, so I decided to upgrade my old flip phone as well. Triple minutes for life is great and Tracfone actually not only triples your minutes it does an equal share across the board for text/data/talk. So there isn't any confusion on this, I'll demonstrate it for you... you buy minutes, say 400 minutes, right! So when you activate your 400 minute card you will receive 1200 minutes, that 400 X 3 = 1200. So now you'll have 1200 text minutes/ 1200 talk minutes and 1200 data minutes, from a 400 minute card. That's GREAT aint it!!!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FM7R1WG" id="B00FM7R1WG-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-16:</strong> I am perfectly happy with mine.

I'm coming from an LG 800, and the Valet is far better. Yes, the phone is rather slow and the display isn't killer great, but it has all the capabilities you may want. (An exception here is watching movies... They play with too low a frame rate and really aren't watchable.) But I'm quite happy with the phone overall. Be sure to check out Google's Play Music service - where you can upload as many as 20K songs for free and have them available to the device over WiFi or downloaded to the phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FM7R1WG" id="B00FM7R1WG-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-01:</strong> I have had this phone for a few day now and it work better than expected.

My Verizon account cost was $48 a month(with taxes) for just talk no text or data.  Same minutes plus text and date when needed for half the cost and still on Verizon towers(three bars most of the time).  This was a no brainer to save $300 a year. Four stars for solid phone.

ALL of the TF Androids are very entry level phones and as such be prepared for entry level performance.People look at the listed specs and note a 4 gig SD card but no mention of on board memory. Just for the record my phone after adding a few apps to it has 2.6 gigs of free space on the phone and well over 3 gigs on the 4 gig SD card that comes with the phone. With the size of the OS and what apps I installed I will speculate that the phone has 4 gigs on board and comes with the 4 gig SD. Not bad for a phone that is less than 100.00.When I first got it out of the box I put my GMail acct on it and started installing my apps. This bogged the phone down fast and for a short while I wondered if this was a bad phone, but remembering past situations even with tablets I just set the phone down and let it do its installs. After I was done installing apps I also downloaded the TF app that notifies you of available Call time, remaining text and available data, it also allows you to add time to your phone from the phone like any other TF, This app is very nice to have in the Google Play Store (GPS) since these Android phones do not have anything like it out of box.One person above posted that the Valet loses its connection to WiFI frequently and I have to agree, it seems to have a weak wifi antenna.While it would be great if this was better, it is not a game changer for me. My need for this phone is a way for my employer to reach me through the day. My boss gets on the phone, says what needs saying and is off. Little to no time wasted chatting. I suspect along with being very busy he is trying to save those platinum priced minutes that all cell phone companies charge for.A quick run down. It is a entry level phone so it has only 512 megs of ram, 1 gig processor and 4 gigs on board memory, touch screen is fairly responsive, it has a 3mp camera and flash on back and I don't remember the MP on the front. The back camera takes fair pictures. But only fair.Sound could be better, things are plenty clear but volumes could be louder. Again, entry level phone.In call....Everything seems to work just fine. In call volumes are fine, no echoes or reception problems, the phone is provided for by Verizon so if your in a good Verizon area you should be in good shape. But just keep in mind, if your current phone has bad reception in a given area this one probably will as well. My other work phone which I hope to replace with the Valet is a Straight Talk slider/android also covered by Verizon and the Valet has all the same drops that the other phone has. Seems Verizon just has few towers in some areas.Long story short, The ZTE Valet is a decent phone for the price. Remember it is a entry level phone at a entry level price and the phone is NOT loaded to the hilt with every bell and whistle. It does have Android 4.1 on it which is a plus and it does run fairly smoothly on a phone wit such low specs. This is a feather in ZTEs cap.One last note. My current monthly cell cost is 45.00+tax. And there was a LOT of that that was never used because it was strictly a work phone so it was used for 8 to 10 hours a day and then turned off for the evening and weekends.The Valet will allow me to cut the monthly price down to 20.00+ tax a month.I call that a win win. it will take 4 months for the phone to pay for itself and then it is pure savings after that, aprox 25.00 a month. and that is 300.00 a year I can use else ware.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FM7R1WG" id="B00FM7R1WG-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-03:</strong> I was dying to get away from my contract plan (Galaxy Note 2 on US Cellular) and spotted this device in the store one day.  Never before did I imagine a functional Android phone could be maintained for as little as $7/month on a cellular network that is very reliable.  Yet, here it is...and I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to test the Android waters without spending a fortune.Let's be clear what this is not: A high-end phone with a data plan that allows you to stream audio and YouTube like it's going out of a style.  It is not a Samsung S4 with a snappy processor and hi-res camera.  If you're looking for that type of Android experience, you'll have to spend hundreds more -- even on a prepaid device.  What the Valet does do, however, is remarkable for its specific price point.The 1 GHz processor can run basic apps just fine.  Anything that is demanding (like games or HD video) will obviously challenge the Valet's hardware.  Just out of curiosity, I played Temple Run Oz since that game has fast-paced 3D graphics and relies heavily on accurate touch response and tilting.  To my surprise, the game was actually playable on the Valet.  The frame rate was sluggish in brief instances, and the overall display wasn't visually stunning, but the swipes and tilts registered quite effectively.  Considering this is a bare-bones mobile device, it was a bit surprising to see this game perform adequately.The Valet's battery life is typical for Android.  The call quality seemed passable, but the speaker volume is a little on the weak side.  Most of the specs on this phone are running average to below-average compared to other Android devices.  One pleasant surprise was the inclusion of a notification LED.  Even some mid-range phones lack this important feature, but the Valet does have it.  It also accepts MicroSD cards up to 32 GB, in case the 4 GB card (included) does not get the job done.I was also pleasantly surprised by the amount of on-board storage.  Most entry-level prepaid devices don't have nearly enough internal storage capability.  The Valet boasts 4 GB internal, so you should have enough room for all your important apps and even a little extra space for non-essential ones.  Once again, for a sub-$100 Android device, you certainly can't find too many faults here.The biggest downside is the camera which is barely useful for anything but the simplest photos.  There is a flash, but no auto-focus.  The image quality might be okay for MMS messages.  However, anything beyond that purpose is going to be a disappointment.  This is not a huge deal-breaker for me personally since the phone does well in other areas.It is Tracfone's tremendous value which has made the Valet impressive to me.  Not everyone needs a high-end mobile device that costs over $100 per month to operate.  In fact, most people could get by with far less and not suffer any ill consequences.  This is the market segment that is all too often ignored by the big carriers.  If you're someone who has sat on the fence about getting a smartphone because of cost, the Valet has taken away your very last reservation.  Plans can run as little as $7 per month, depending on your usage patterns of course, and are extremely flexible for most basic-to-moderate cell phone users.  As an added bonus, the Valet is powered by Verizon's well-respected CDMA network meaning you won't have to worry much about &#34;dead zones&#34; and dropped calls.I couldn't give this phone a five-star rating due to some technical shortcomings, but it has earned a solid four-star review in my estimation.  Simply put, in a dollar-to-dollar comparison, the Valet on Tracfone gives you more than most every other prepaid offering out there right now.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FM7R1WG" id="B00FM7R1WG-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-13:</strong> My family has been a longtime Tracfone subscriber and we wanted to upgrade from our LG500GHL phones to smartphones.  I was  pleasantly surprised that Tracfone offered 3 phones for our area.  I narrowed it down to the Samsung Galaxy Centura and this ZTE phone.  After comparing specifications and reading a bunch of reviews I decided to go with the ZTE Valet and the family couldn't be happier.  I didn't purchase the phones here. I ended up getting them for $49.99 from Target and Best Buy.  We have only had the phones for 10 days, but no one has any complaints, so far.All the bad reviews relating to WIFI had me scared and was the biggest concern to not get this particular phone.  That fear has quickly gone away.  We get great reception through our Netgear router.  The reception is no better or worse than any of our other wireless products.  My biggest concern now is how long will the phone last.  Time will tell and I will adjust this review accordingly.Upgrading the phones through Tracfone was quick and easy.  Doing it online and following their directions was simple and pain free.  All our minutes transferred over and the phones were operating in less than 30 minutes.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FM7R1WG" id="B00FM7R1WG-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-24:</strong> This is one of 2 Android phones offered by TracFone and one of the first Android phones I've seen where you don't have to buy a monthly contract (unlike Straight Talk). You add minutes by using cards or by buying them from TracFone's website. On this phone, when you add minutes, you will also get the same amount of data minutes in megs. For example, I have a triple-minutes-for-life phone, so when I add a 60 minute card for $19.99, I actually get 180 talk minutes, 180 text messages and 180 megabytes of data. Also, whenever you add minutes, you automatically get 3 months of service. All these minutes and messages and megs carry over to the next month. (My older Tracfone has a service end date sometime in 2016 from all the cumulative carry overs) :)Some basic specs:1 Ghz single-core ARM7 processorHas Android Jellybean (4.1)The MicroSD slot accepts expansion cards up to 32 gigabytesCamera has a flash.The phone has hardware GPS, even though it doesn't mention it in the specs.Separate camera button on the lower right of the phone (which means it will be upper-right when you rotate the phone to take pictures)This phone doesn't have the usual Tracfone custom firmware, typical of older Tracfones, with a pre-paid icon for managing your account and a constant "minutes remaining" on your Home Screen. You might not even think it was a pay-as-you-go phone at first glance because Tracfone has done a great job of staying out of the way of the phone's operating system and just handling the billing. Instead, Tracfone has an App on the Google Play store that you can use to check your balance and add minutes. The App also has a widget that you can place on an adjacent home screen if you want to do a quick check on your balance. Another nice thing is that if you have WiFi access, the phone will automatically use your WiFi connection for anything Internet-related instead of your precious data minutes. (Talk minutes still go over the phone network, unless you're using Skype or something)The phone works fine as an Android 4,1 Internet tablet right out of the box thanks to the built in WiFi. You'll get an "activation needed" message each time you start up the phone, but I was able to play around with it all day, setting up my Google Play account and trying out Apps until I got it home. I'm quite happy with it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FM7R1WG" id="B00FM7R1WG-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-15:</strong> ninth day in my phone died after buying it . the ear piece no longer worked . i read alot of bad reviews on it .i have the replacement coming from tracphone hope that one doesnt do the same. if ur thinking on buying it.I would look at the lg model came out this month before deciding.link here"LG Optimus Dynamic II Tracfone"or the centura .down the road i will get lg one i like there phones better.camera isn't the greatest in doors even with the flash against the lg 840g that i hadlg 840g compare to this in quality is more durable phone but its not androidupdatemy friend bought one its having problem and i told him to wait and get the lg version . well after two months of this phone im getting the lg39c android and the people who have them like them. avoid to buy this phone its slow and slugish and its the most returned phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FM7R1WG" id="B00FM7R1WG-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-10:</strong> This is a great value.

I've been using it for about a week now and I like it a great deal.  It is responsive, has good battery life, recharges quickly, has a bright screen and all the Android bells and whistles.  I'd of course prefer a more powerful camera but for the price, what can one expect?This is 50% off the current TracFone on-line price, so it's a real steal.  I sometimes have to use reading glasses to see the 3.5&#34; screen, but for $7 a month I can live with that.I do wish TracFone would come out with an inexpensive 5 or 6&#34; screen phone; that would be ideal.

It didn't come with a touchstone cover but she always liked my Pre's touchstone features. I bought her this cover, a Palm car charger, and two touchstones (one for her desk, and another for her car).The cover adds a nice bit of fun to a cute and small albeit rather drab looking phone  (when it's all black). The functionality it adds to the phone for a low price is pretty amazing too. With the touchstone cover and a touchstone, you can answer calls by picking up the phone, if you answer a call while it's on the touchstone it'll goto speaker phone mode, when you are on a call and pick it up from the TS it'll switch from speaker phone to handset mode. It's a very intelligent and  simple system.The case it's self isn't perfect though. the one gripe my gf had about it is that the door for the Micro USB port is a little hard to open because the magnet always wants it shut. small thing but it does add a level of frustration.I would recommend the Touch Stone cover for any Pixi out there.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B0036VNU0C', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B0036VNU0C', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00BOYTHR8</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00BOYTHR8</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BOYTHR8" id="B00BOYTHR8-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-09:</strong> It came in new condition and did the job, fit well into the phone and charged at a reasonable speed,</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BOYTHR8" id="B00BOYTHR8-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-18:</strong> This car charger works as advertised.

Good value for money, and I have not experienced any problems with losing the connection between the devices and my computer.The only real problem is that transfer speeds are irritatingly slow. With the E63 I prefer loading the micro SD card into my computer for better speeds. That isn't an option on my other phone. Transferring albums, podcasts etc feels a lot like the internet did back in the dial up days. You end up waiting around a lot.But I don't think this is a problem with the cable, rather with the underlying technology of the phone. Maybe it's the cable. I don't know. At least, I don't imagine a different cable would make it go any faster. So I believe this cable is a good deal.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B002ZM6BE0', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B002ZM6BE0', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li>
