I believe it it made for the Desire only. It is harder to get on than the previous case I bought for the Inspire from another source. Although it fits, it is difficult to get around to edges while trying to put it on and take it off.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004QFZJQA" id="B004QFZJQA-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-08-21:</strong> Fits like a glove and protects your phone to some digree, also makes it less likely to slip out of your hand while holding. You need a screen protector also.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004QFZJQA" id="B004QFZJQA-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-09-17:</strong> This cover fits my HTC Inspire 4G perfectly. When I first placed it on my phone, it took a little time to get it on the phone. Then it fit very snugly. This is normal for a "Hard Gel" type of phone cover. It is harder than silicone so it does not stretch like a silicone cover, yet is is thicker and fits so much better than a silicone cover or hard cover. This keeps the weight of the phone down and much better than the 2 piece hard cover or silicone cover!***The color is a MUCH DARKER PINK than the picture shows. However, a very attractive and functional cover!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004QFZJQA" id="B004QFZJQA-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-04:</strong> It's cute but I found the rubber would get stuck in my hair when talking.

It protects the phone without inhibiting any of the screen, camera, or controls.  Several cases I have used covered the microphone or charging port making it impossible to use some accessories, but I have not experienced that problem with this case.  It looks very smart and professional.  You cant beat the warranty with Otterbox!  Great price.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006PHABRO" id="B006PHABRO-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-17:</strong> Excellent product a must have for any I phone user.

The commuter case is perfect size with the protection that it needs. The only problem I had with the case was actually getting the phone into the case. The phone would not fit flush up against the case which bothered me to no end. After a couple forceful pushes in, it now fits flush inside the case. Great Product.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006PHABRO" id="B006PHABRO-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-23:</strong> bought this case in a hurry after my old case was crushed by cyclist on a trail, but it completely protected my iphone 4s.

I bought one just like it for my  old phone that my son uses to watch movies and I dont have to worry about the phone getting destroyed. The only gripe is the little strip at the bottom of the case which breaks after a while.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006PHABRO" id="B006PHABRO-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-09:</strong> The case came in a plastic sealed package with a little brochure that I've never seen a genuine Otterbox come with, and it didn't come with a screen protector. But, the case fit perfectly and shows to every bit as durable as a genuine Otterbox.So you can go to the store and spend $35 on one and get the not that great screen protector, or this one for $12.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006PHABRO" id="B006PHABRO-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-13:</strong> overall this is great product. it does an amazing job of protecting the phone as well as being easy to slip out of a pocket. the one downside is the off button is very hard to push.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006PHABRO" id="B006PHABRO-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-01:</strong> love this case.. tho it broke when my boyfriend took it off his phone, i know otterbox has really nice case</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006PHABRO" id="B006PHABRO-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-16:</strong> i love Otterbox and their products, however i accidently bought the wrong one I wanted the defender, but I can gift it at christmas!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006PHABRO" id="B006PHABRO-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-03:</strong> I love the Otterbox Commuter series, and have ALL the colors.  I mix and match the soft rubber inserts with the hard outer shells to make lots more color combinations.  It's attractive and very protective at the same time.  Easy to take on and off,  smooth to hold, and very well priced.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006PHABRO" id="B006PHABRO-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-21:</strong> I like this case, as it provides the protection that is needed.  The only drawback to this phone case is the silicone plugs that cover the ear phone jack and the silicone weakens over time.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006PHABRO" id="B006PHABRO-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-04-21:</strong> I have used several otterbox cases for iphones they are great the one i have used in 4g is too big the defender is too really big for the phone.

I have several phones and have tried Otterbox cases with every one of them and I'm still wondering what people are talking about when they say it's "a great case".  This one is no different from other Otterbox cases I have tried.  I am disappointed with this case.  Fit is sloppy.  The rubber seems too soft and pliable and does not stay in place.  Recharging batteries in smart phones should be done without a case in order to keep the temperatures of the battery as low as possible and removing the case is easy but installing it will find you fighting with overly soft rubber parts that get mangled until you play with it for quite a while.  I find it uncomfortable to hold the phone to my ear because of the plastic edges on the case and all around quality seems lacking.  I don't get the hype.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006PHABRO" id="B006PHABRO-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-01:</strong> Bought as a Christmas gift. It comes in two pieces. A rubber piece and then a plastic outer piece. My daughter loves the case. It is well made and has the Otterbox logo in it.

It connects to the vehicle for charging your phone: You slip the phone in, push the latch [containing the usb plug,] the phone turns on, charges as required, and a specialized navigation panel pops up on the phone screen. You can still navigate to other areas on the phone by using the return symbol on the screen. That takes you off the specialized nav panel and you can then navigate the phone as normal. A plus: As soon as you unmount the phone, it remembers your car's location. You can with a free download in the Market then find your way back to the car. It remembers your coordinates automatically! On occasion when I've forgotten where I parked, I found the app to be quite accurate. Also, you can even take a picture of your location as well on the specialized app. NOTE: This dock is ONLY for the Razr. It will not work with other Motorola phones, like the Bionic.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005W8NLG0" id="B005W8NLG0-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-03-08:</strong> I bought this dock for my Motorola Droid Razr Maxx.  The dock works with both the Razr and the Razr Maxx.  There is a snap on piece of plastic you remove to use it with the Maxx.  This dock securely attaches to the windshield, holds the phone securely in place, charges the phone, and transmits sound via the charging cable to a 3.5 mm jack that can be attached to your car stereo's Aux In (if your car stereo is equipped).The dock functions well, is appealing to the eye, and I love the navigation screen.Con's:  Without a case to bulk up the Razr Maxx, the phone will fall out when you release the sliding side dock-in port, which can be a distraction.With a decent hard case on your phone, the dock holds the phone well, works properly and does not release the phone to fall down in your car, when you release the side sliding dock-in port.Overall, I'd recommend this dock.  However, get a hard case for your Razr Maxx and the Roadster for speaker phone and FM transmission and you'll enjoy it more than without those other accessories.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005W8NLG0" id="B005W8NLG0-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-13:</strong> This window mount for my Motorola Razor met all my needs.

Probably to facilitate "skins", getting a naked phone into the dock requires wrestling with the position so the charging plug will slide in. Its frustrating.

Allows my bluetooth headset voice to talk and listen...I have a Sound ID Six bluetooth headset.  Pricey...yes, a bit for a car dock.  Charging cord also has an additional slot to charge an mp3 player I believe?  This dock also allows for the Motorola car finder app to pop up automatically once you remove the phone from the dock so you can later find your car in case you've forgotten where you parked. The dock does not allow for sending or receiving text messages which is a wonderful safety feature in this wild and crazy driving world we find ourselves in.  So, is it fantastic, no.

There are some good features with this mount.1. The instructions for use are very clear abut how to slide the USB adapter to plug and unplug the phone. I had to wiggle it just a bit to make sure it lined up, but once I plugged it in, the phone switched to the car mode with no problem. Removing it was easy also. I believe a  bit of care and not being too rough when mounting/unmounting the phone will help to ensure a long life for this product.2. The adapter plate, while a bit hard to remove, was not too hard. The curve of the holder is what gave me the most difficulty. I did not want to break it while removing it. The best thing seems to be work from one corner. Once that is loose, move to the other corner on the same end. After the two corners are loose, it will slide right out. With the adapter plate removed, the mount is perfect for use with my Droid Razr while it is in the case I had purchased for it. If I decide to remove the case later, I will just need to put the adapter plate back in and it will be the right size for the phone then.3. The ball mount:  I have a dash beanbag style mount for a Garmin GPS. Instead of using the windshield mount or the disk to make it dash-mounted, I decided to pop the Garmin mount off the ball on the beanbag. It was the perfect size to then pop into the back of the phone mount. I now have my phone set up with my preferred mount. (The Garmin will use a separate vent-clip mount I had been using for my old Droid phone).4. The charger:  I like the dual adapter. It will let me plug a second USB device in without having to use a separate power outlet adapter.Overall, I am well pleased with this purchase. If it holds up as well as I think it should, I would consider it a good purchase.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005W8NLG0" id="B005W8NLG0-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-23:</strong> Solid, well made, and keeps me legal.

I like because it has a built in stand that can hold the phone up vertically or horizontally.  The car dock is adjustable for phones with or without a case.  You just have to remove the extra plate. The OEM case is a bit different from most cases, it does not have cover over the front edge on the top and bottom of the phone.  The design causes a poor fit.  While I yet to see the phone fall out, would not recommend using the OEM case with the dock.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B005W8NLG0', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B005W8NLG0', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B005FSRZX2</h2>    <p class="price"> $B005FSRZX2</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FSRZX2" id="B005FSRZX2-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-25:</strong> Everything works well and fits nicely.

However, when I tried to plug my Note II into the dock to charge, it does not even mate with the micro USB on the dock.  I was a little perplexed as to why, so I plugged the micro USB charge cable that came with the dock (and bypassed the dock) to my Note II and it plugs in fine!  Looking at the plugs side by side, I noticed that they look different--the female slot on the dock is a bit smaller than the female slot on the micro USB plug on the charging cable...there's the culprit:  manufacturing flaw, as best that I can see.  All I know is that if I try to push my phone in any harder, I was afraid that I would damage my phone.  I tried to get a replacement for it thinking that it may be just a fluke, but Amazon did not provide me an option to get a replacement, only a return.  Now I have to pay for return postage and also out the shipping charges I paid to have it shipped to me in the first place...Oh well...just beware folks.

The charger had some sort of problem where it would make the touch screen on my phone go completely erratic. With the with a visual screen senor I could see that with the charger my phone would register my finger touching all parts of the screen when I was just touching one part.Overall the dock was great, but the charger they supplied me made my phone useless on the dock.UPDATE:After using the dock as a charger for two weeks (while the charger did make the screen go crazy, it did however charge my phone) my phone has stopped charging.The orange light would turn on indicating that the phone was being "charging" but the battery continued to deplete.After contacting HTC and telling them my problem they concluded that my phones USB port had been fried. The HTC representative I spoke too told me this dock and its supplied charger were probably the what caused my problem and that I would have to have the phone repaired or replaced.If you get a bad charger from these guys, return it immediately, it could end up frying the USB port on your phone like it did to mine.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FSRZX2" id="B005FSRZX2-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-07:</strong> Seems to be working as advertised. You do have to take the phone's case off--fortunately I have a very minimal Boxwave case that  comes off instantly (very handy for quick battery swaps if needed). The aux battery charging slot in the back of the EZO is a snug fit, but not a problem. No stability issues noted.Let me add an important battery tip for owners of the original Note if you think your phone isn't giving you a full days charge... I put up with what I thought was normal battery life for the Note for over a year--I thought I just had to live with it. I would take the phone off of the charger with 100% at 6:30 am, and do various light email, web & app browsing (stuff like G+, Twitter, Flipboard) plus maybe stream music for a couple of hours. By 3:30 it would frequently be at under 20%, sometimes even without much use at all. I discovered that my battery was likely improperly calibrated from the very beginning. I recently did a factory reset and then did a 'battery calib' which consists of charging to 100%, turning off & removing battery for a minute, turning back on an immediately recharging to 100% again. I now get enough charge to do all of the above things and usually have 75% left by evening. I could probably skip a day if I wanted. I liked this phone a lot before but the battery management was a bit annoying. Now I friggin' LOVE it. I will think twice about upgrading to Jelly Bean (if it ever shows up) for fear of losing this awesome performance I'm getting now.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FSRZX2" id="B005FSRZX2-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-22:</strong> This is one of the best docks I have ever purchased, I love how I can use it caseless or with a case, I have used this for over a year and still works like new, I would highly recommend to anyone with an HTC One!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FSRZX2" id="B005FSRZX2-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-30:</strong> I bought this for my LG and it is also suitable for many Samsung models.

The unit itself looks and connects well, but the plug in the back pops out very easily.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FSRZX2" id="B005FSRZX2-review19" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-03:</strong> EZOPower Sync Transfer USB Dual Dock Cradle Desktop Charger love it with my PC and as a  Charger too, and to ID too</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FSRZX2" id="B005FSRZX2-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-08:</strong> This is the greatest charger in the world!

This is exactly what I was looking for.  Bought two of them.  One for the office and one for the night table next to my bed.  No more bulky alarm clock.  Now just a beautiful HTC One staring at me when I wake up in the morning.Only issue I have is the USB cable it comes with is a little short.  Wish it was longer.

The spare battery charger in the back works great and is a fantastic bonus.  the dock is lightweight but sits very solidly. the little rubber feet underneath keep it from sliding around when you are using the phone in the dock.  It fits in tightly so you will need to hold the stand in order to withdraw the phone, but the solid grip is good think IMO.  Havent tried to hood the dock into my computer or any audio device so I can't speak as to it's back up or media potential...it just sits on my bedside table so it's charged every morning.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FSRZX2" id="B005FSRZX2-review24" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-28:</strong> It sure is nice having a dock for your phone and the extra battery charger is a plus. My only beef is that my Otterbox defender case (the slipon one) has to come off before I can slip it in to charge. I tried taking out the plate but it still doesn't fit. I guess you would have to have one of those cases that are extremely thin to be able to just pop it on. But, for $10 definitely a good buy.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FSRZX2" id="B005FSRZX2-review25" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-20:</strong> This charger is a great fit for my HTC One with a slim case and i love it.

And the vendor wants me to send them the Congressional Record to justify why I need to return it.

After that it began blowing my fuse whenever I plugged it in.Granted changing fuses in a car (I have a Jeep Wrangler, so it's under the hood) is pretty simple, but after the thirdor fourth occurrence, it becomes a bit tiresome. After I used my last spare fuse I decided to purchase a new(and different) USB charger from elsewhere. That new one has been with me longer than this one ever was,and has yet to give me a singe problem.Also, I would like to add that I did take apart this USB charger after I replaced it with the new one. I figured a contact hadcome loose inside and was shorting things out, and thus blowing my fuses. I was wrong. It seems whatever was causingmy fuses to blow was due to some failed component within the unit itself. I did not care enough to poke around with myvoltage meter to find the issue, but it does look to me that my charger has some fatal design flaw, perhaps broughtout by prolonged usage (I leave mine plugged in, so it was always on when my Jeep was running). Perhaps mine wasjust a crappy unit, but it stands to reason that others out there will likely fail in the same way. Do yourself a favor andgrab a different USB charger.~Rusty</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003ZWVTXC" id="B003ZWVTXC-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-30:</strong> I needed to charge my phone in the car because I drive between home and school a lot, works great.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003ZWVTXC" id="B003ZWVTXC-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-18:</strong> It works great.

I wanted as &#34;smart&#34; a phone as I could get without being required to pay $40.00 or more per month for service, and the LG 840G fits the bill beautifully! I must admit that I don't tend to use the web on my phone all that much, but the screen is an acceptable size if I need to do so. The camera is great and I've sent photos to friends. ( I'm not a kid, and switched from a flip phone, to see if I could adjust to the touch screen, and it was so easy with this phone!) Texting is a &#34;piece of cake&#34;, with the virtual qwerty keyboard. The service is key, though. Tracfone is great, (same family as Net10), as this phone, as a tracfone, has triple minutes for life, but if you require 500 or more minutes per month, this phone, wit Net10 service is the way to go. I like using a stylus with it, and Amazon has some great choices, (including some that connect to the phone so it is always handy), but the touch screen responds just as well to your fingertips. The LG840G may not be a smartphone, per se, but it is certainly smart enough for me, and, probably for many more people out there, who just wanna be a bit more updated and feel more connected to what everyone else is doing.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009LS142A" id="B009LS142A-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-19:</strong> Bought my wife one a couple weeks ago and liked it so well I bought myself one.I've been using NET10 for years.

The price was right and it works as advertised. Now that my wife and I have matching phones (HTC Evo's)it's so convenient to be able to plug in either or both phones while driving. The unit comes packaged with one cord so we just bring along an extra one so we can charge both phones at the same time.Usually, my wife seems to always forget to charge her phone at home so she's used it quite a bit more than I. When we're on long road trips we leave the phones plugged in so we can use them as we travel and when we get to our distination, our phones are (usually) fully charged for a day of sight-seeing.I use the GPS (Sprint service) feature on the phone, so my old Magellan GPS is now obsolete. Besides, the battery had gone out (dead) on the Magellan and it would have cost what I paid for one of the phones (with rebate), and I was just about to pay out nearly a hundred dollars to update the navigation system. Thank goodness we bought the new phones.By the way, the blue light on the plug (the part that goes into the car's cigarette lighter) is just right and bright enough to let us know the connection is working. The phones have battery-charging indicators also.Rate a 10 on a scale of 1-10.

Combine the genuine Motorola quality with Hollycell's extremely low price and the fast free delivery makes this an absolute recommended buy to anyone needing this model.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0026LP2AY" id="B0026LP2AY-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-16:</strong> This battery was not the same as the original equipment; it did work with the phone which was a great choice for my mother.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B0026LP2AY', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B0026LP2AY', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00DIF64EK</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00DIF64EK</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DIF64EK" id="B00DIF64EK-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-04:</strong> None of the 5 enclosed screen covers would stay on.

These screen protectors come individually wrapped and they each have a new thin, but effective micro-fiber wipe.

It was the best case I have ever had. I prefer a rubberized grip case that gives a good grip, but is still relatively lightweight. Even the Apple store employees have recommended this case as a favorite and it is easy to see why. It is easy to add your phone, provides protection and some lightweight drop protection if dropped on the side or back (also pointed out by an Apple employee). There are the necessary openings for your peripherals and a covered button for the On/Off switch. The grip is great and you can charge and sync in the case with no problems! This is the only case I use for my phones. I highly recommend them.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0093IHY7M" id="B0093IHY7M-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-11:</strong> Recently upgraded from the iPhone 4 to the 5s.This case is great! The matte finish helps for the grip. The buttons for the volume and sleep/wake works and responsive. The cut outs for the head jack is nice and large. Worked with my beats pro jack. Cut out for lightning cable is perfectly fine, cannot say for third party lightning cables but its fine with the apple stock.What made me a little worried was the camera cut out. I've seen some cases with a larger cut out but my photos were clear, not washed out and the flash worked fine.There is a lay on the table design but its very subtle. I currently have a temporary screen shield and there's plenty of lay on the table design. But I'll see how it is once I've received my tempered glass screen shield.Overall great product!- Slim- Simple yet, stylish- Great grip- Decent price!

So I thought about &#34;well, if it doesn't pan out, I would just return it&#34;I got it this morning &#34;blue harbor version&#34;, and it actually fits rather well with iPhone 5. It gives you enough wiggle room to fit the device inside the case without scratching the edges. Once it is inside, it feels fit, and device doesn't move around as far as I can tell. The case, even though it is rubberized, is actually quite rigid plastic (only the little matte squares are somewhat rubberized).The only complaint I have so far with this phone is that some people (not everyone) complain that they can't seem to hear me all that well. Looking closely at the case, Speck tries its best to fit all the individual mic/speaker openings to the actual openings on iPhone 5. However, if the device moves a little bit to the right or left inside the case (not noticeable from pure visual inspection), I suppose those openings can get obstructed. Another theory to the voice quality drop is entirely unrelated to the case itself. I have heard report on drops in voice quality via LTE, so I need to verify if voice quality does improve if I disable LTE.And I am in Houston, TX, where LTE band 17 is operated.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0093IHY7M" id="B0093IHY7M-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-03:</strong> i really love this case and thats all there is to it buy now. thank you very much for making this case speck</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0093IHY7M" id="B0093IHY7M-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-22:</strong> I like this speck pixelskin caseprosThis case is very thin and light weight not very bulkyThe texture pattern is easy to gripNice cutouts on the bottom and top of the caseThis case is made of TPU plastic so it is not prone to fingerprintsEasy to install and removeconA little loosefittingThis case is kind of a matte black but on the back is shiny with Matt squares the cutouts are nice on the bottom of the cases you don't get any kind of flappy little thin piece the speaker has holes instead of large cutouts which is nice you can easily use any third-party charging cables with this as it has a generous cutout overall this case has a nice-looking feel I was sent this case for review</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0093IHY7M" id="B0093IHY7M-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-22:</strong> Really like the feel, style and texture of this case.

I've always been pleased because speck generally learned from the cases they made and improved.  Not the case with the iphone 5.  The case is too firm compared to the material used to produce the 4/4s case.  The buttons are the side are stiff as was the power button. It did not feel like the phone was protected well at all and I've felt like if I dropped the phone it would fall out.  I am writing this review a little late as I had the case back in November, and it is now June.

When I took the case out it felt amazing in my hand it was super light and it looked so cool I couldn't wait to slide my phone in this case. I thought to myself now I have the best case. Also in the packaging was some warranty info. Once I slid my phone in the case and put it in my hand it was great. I must say I am very impressed with this company. As I was saying, the case felt good in my hand. There is also a nice lip on it not as big as I wanted but still nice enough. I love how all the ports are easy and accessible. The lock and volume buttons are easy to press mushy affect to them at all. I have a screen protecter on both the front and back of the phone and let me tell you that you don't Have to worry about it peeling of getting messed up. I must say that I wanted a nice sleek compact case and that's what I got. This was a big step away from all the bulky cases I have purchased in the past. I 100% recommend this case for anyone who is looking for a simple case.

It offers excellent protection to the Xperia Z. All sides of the phone are protected and the corners are thicker to protect against corner falls. All buttons are accessible. The charging and audio ports are a little bit difficult to uncover, but not impossible. The edges around the screen of the phone tend to collect quite a bit of dirt, which might scratch your screen or screen protector. This case is meant to be carried in your pocket or purse. A belt clip would've been nice. Instead you get a kick stand. The kick stand's design is good, but the method of it clicking closed is kind of poor. It relies on two small plastic teeth to snap into the body of the case. However, frequent use of the kick stand will make those teeth go dull and eventually wont snap on the case anymore. Overall, good case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C003ZJQ" id="B00C003ZJQ-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-12:</strong> Functional, but rarely use the kickstand only to watch movies (which I rarely do on my phone).

Any kind of aftermarket charger will simply not fit-Even worse, the cutout for headphones won't fit ANY headphones or any other kind of 3.5mm cable I tried to put in there, including my specially-designed-for-this-kind-of-thing Mediabridge 3.5mm cable.However, the price is good enough that these cons are somewhat forgivable. The case is easy enough to remove that you can plug in what you need. If I were to pay anymore than the $5.95 they're asking though, I would expect the manufacturer to address this issue.Would be nice though if most case designers realized that consumers don't want to have to remove their case anytime they want to charge the phone or use the headphone jack.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AJXE23E" id="B00AJXE23E-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-16:</strong> It's thin, it gives you access where needed, protects from low falls.

The sound volume seems almost muffled - as another review pointed out, it seems difficult to get any sound output from these regardless of my device's volume setting. The sound quality itself is also very flat and hollow. The headset includes three different size earbud adapters so you can find the best fit for your ear canal. No problem there, I found a size that fits my ears just fine. But with ear buds such as this, once you insert them far enough into the ear canals you generally have quality sound and deep bass.  That was not my experience with this headset - the sound was very dull and lifeless compared to my other ear buds.  The quality is fine for calls, but perhaps the electronics are optimized for voice, not music. I love bluetooth earbuds because unleashed is the way to go, and the range of these is quite good.

I listen to audio books on my way to and from work so need a good headset that I can wear and be able to move my head freely without having to readjust the earbuds or having the earbuds popping out of my ears all the time.  These were not that set.  I tried each of the provided sets of earbuds and none of them would conform to my ears well enough that I wasn't having to constantly adjust or put them back in my ears after they popped out.  I would have been really frustrated if I was to use them while I was doing any kind of vigorous movement.  I gave these a three because the sound was really good and I liked the ease with which I was able to link with my phone.  I was ready to go with in five minutes of taking them out of the box.

They are extremely useful, versatile, and convenient, especially when you're active.  When I had the chance to try out this Plantronics BackBeat Bluetooth headset, I jumped at the opportunity.Unfortunately, I was hugely disappointed.Plantronics has always been one of the middle-of-the-road electronics company for me, never rising above some of the greats (like Bose or Sony).  This set doesn't even reach mediocre.The biggest problem it has is really quite simple: Sometimes it just doesn't work.  Unless my iPhone 4 is perfectly still and within a few feet of the headset, the sound flickers in & out.  This is a real pain while jogging/running/working out because the motion of the iPhone sometimes interferes with the listening.  The only time I've been able to have good sound quality with no flickering/interference is while sitting/standing perfectly still with the iPhone not moving.  If this is the main function for the earbuds, why have them wireless?  Mobility is the main reason to get wireless anything, right?Also, and this is goes right with the previous point, the range is a complete lie.  The manual says the range for good quality is about 30 feet.  Fully charged, properly set up with my iPhone, I maxed out around 10 feet.  That's nothing.  That's, what, half the length of a typical bedroom?Overall, this is NOT a good earbud system.  I believe there will be good updates to it that will make it good eventually, but just avoid it for now.2/5.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007MC6WGK" id="B007MC6WGK-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-18:</strong> LOVE these... works great with ipad and ipod... you need to make sure you disconnect or &#34;unpair&#34; if you wanna switch devices.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007MC6WGK" id="B007MC6WGK-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-21:</strong> Ordered prime and received these fast.

It's longer enough so the earbuds don't snag when they're in you rears and so they hang down at a reasonable level when they're not.  That is, in case you're wondering, 25".  It's flat, as opposed to round, and doesn't slide on skin.  The benefit is the buds won't slide off when they're not in your ears.  (Thanks to the aforementioned length they still don't pull when you're listening to music.)Multiple device support:  Not there and not a problem if you only need to connect to one device.  If it is a problem the check out the LG Tone I mentioned up top.  Ir is a pretty good headset and you might even find a used one on eBay before very long...</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007MC6WGK" id="B007MC6WGK-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-26:</strong> It works nicely.

Surprisingly, this BT headset sound quality ain't bad! It's crisp and clean with a good mix of low bass. Granted the sound is far from my Sony BT50 or X10, but for $59.00 it's a good value  Streaming music from my iPhone worked well. Once paired, you'll see a small battery meter in the upper right corner. My primary use of this headphones was for gym (I also have a Sony BT50 but at times, find this a bit too big). Since I primarily use it on my iPhone, I didn't matter if it was not able to multi-pair.Likes:- Micro USB charger- Small size- Sound Quality. Overall good sound- Cord length. It's about 18-inches, and I think it's a good length.- Includes a couple of extra loop for a more comfortable stay in ear fit.Neutral:- Battery life rated at 4.5 hours of usage, and it's pretty dead on. Given it's size, I think this is acceptable but would've like the usage to be in the 6 hour range- Noise Isolation. Compared to my X10, this does not isolate noise that well.Dislikes:- Switching out tips can be a tough. During my fitting, I was afraid I was going to rip the tips. There were no instructions included on how to properly switch them out.- Volume. Volume not very high. I estimate it's about 75% of my x10- Remote. Hard to see and press. Although it's raised buttons, it's mono-black and hard to see and feel the right button. The remote also has not dedicated buttons to skip tracks.- No case/pouch to carry this in...Overall, I give this 5 starts because of it's value vs. price..</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007MC6WGK" id="B007MC6WGK-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-27:</strong> light weight strong nice sound easy to operate battery last long enougs used for one hour and worked good comes with three different sizes of ear plugs</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007MC6WGK" id="B007MC6WGK-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-22:</strong> They started out great...

They wear lightly and comfortably enough that they kind of disappear when you take them out of your ears and they are very easy to lose that way.By way of comparison to the LG HBS 700 the Plantronics have a better mic for phone calls but sound much thinner when listening to music and the earbuds were never as comfortable in my ears as the LG's have been.

Like pretty much all Bluetooth headsets on the market today, it has just one tiny LED (dual-color, red and blue) and a few small buttons, so remember what the LED indicator represents and which button does what is a royal pain, especially for an old chap like myself. (I own five BT headsets each with its own indicator interpretations and one-press/two-press functions.)The first thing you may notice is the user-unfriendly packaging. It's not as evil as plastic clamshells but it features plenty of invisible clear tape so you'll get frustrated when you discover there's one more tape you haven't removed. Getting the headphones out of the setting clips should be done with care or you can damage the headphones. The tiny booklet included does not make learning any easier, but it's soemthing you should not leave home without, because you'll need it to learn how to interpret the LED status and also which button is for what, as mentioned before.My biggest beef is the ear plugs are of a very poor fit for me, and I've tried all four sets included in the box. I'm used to invasive earplugs like these but this is the first set that truly manages to make me feel uncomfortable. The end of the plug comes out way too much and makes me look like the Count from Sesame Street, especially if I go out with my beloved cape.  The mediocre sound quality does not save this model.In short, this is a rather poor product.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007MC6WGK" id="B007MC6WGK-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-24:</strong> These earbuds have been through the washer AND drier TWICE now and they still work.

The build is decent, buttons are difficult to manipulate and you must use your right hand to control the buttons.  Battery life is terrible.. you will be lucky to get 3 full hours out of them on a full charge.  Do not plan on using these if you are mowing the lawn or using loud equipment, you will not be able to hear the audio.  You can't pair with more than one device at a time so be prepared to fumble around and turn off blue tooth on one device just to get the headphones to repair with another device.  This has been a big inconvenience.  Positives are that they are light, fit well in the ear and are very inconspicuous.

Out of the box, the mid size plugs were too large, once fitted with the smaller size, which are perfect for me, the base came alive. The sound quality is ridiculously owesome for a sub sixty bucks pair of headphones.I paired it with my iphone, laptop, ipad, new Galaxy Note 2 and have no problems switching back and forth with all these devices. I just have to turn off the headphones and depending on the proximity to my other devices, turn off the bluetooth on the ones I don't want to sink with at the time.I also downloaded a player app with sound equalizer to enhance the volume since these don't have a loud volume and now with that app, I'm all set, plus I get a more enhanced sound quality, not that I needed it since the earphones sound awesome already. The highs are crisp, the mids are just well balanced and the lows are nice deep and clean.I never thought I'd get this level of sound quality from a "phone" products company, but Plantronics has done a great job with these.If I break these, I will run to get another set.I doubt these would be ideal for working out since there is no loop hook to secure, but that's not what I bought them for. Besides, these will prevent outside sound to penetrate and will isolate you from the outside noise, which you don't want when you are doing outdoor activities or working out, but they will be ideal for a plane ride or at night when you want to listen in bed.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007MC6WGK" id="B007MC6WGK-review25" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-07-16:</strong> I had the chance to try out these Backbeat headphones and I am not that happy with them. Let me explain why.First these headphones to me don't fit in my ears well, even with the various tips. The headphones constantly are falling out of my ears. As soon as I think I have them situated I turn my head and it pops out. Next, the volume doesn't get that loud for me. It's sufficient but if you are in an environment with any noise for me it was hard to actually hear my music. Third, the on/off button is too close to the volume up/down buttons. I hit the wrong button constantly.What's good about these? The battery life is decent and I like that it uses the standard micro usb cord, nothing proprietary. But that's about it.If you are in the market for bluetooth headphones my preference is theJabra SPORT Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Black/Yellowwhich is a bit cheaper, and also includes an fm radio. These also stay in/on my ear unlike the BackBeat.I would pass on the backbeat and go with the Jabra Sports.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007MC6WGK" id="B007MC6WGK-review26" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-25:</strong> By far the best bluetooth headset. I have researched and read review after review and went back and forth with products but I eventually decided and bought these and after having them for so long now, I still use them.They are a bit big (nothing to compare to Apple ear buds) but what do you expect the bluetooth wireless tech has to go somewhere. They are not heavy at all and stay within your ear. I love listening to music without having to take my phone out of my pocket or worry about a damn cable.Battery life lasts a full day of listening to music. I bought a small Altoids mint tin to carry them in and protect them because they do not bring a case. For the price I found them worth it and I use them everyday without any problem. The bluetooth range is about 10  or so feet (I'm ball-parking it, I have been able to leave my phone in my room and go the the second floor of my home and still hear music).Would I buy again? Not at this price and with advancing tech probably won'tWould I recommend?

If I turn my head to the right, the left headphone would be pulled out of my ear because the cable wouldn't slide.The headphones also come with stabilizers that are designed to help keep the earphones in your ear, but I spend a lot of time pushing the earphones back into my ear to the point it being uncomfortable.I'm sure these earphones will work for a lot of people, just not for me.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007MC6WGK" id="B007MC6WGK-review34" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-06-20:</strong> I have a hard time with in-ear headphones fitting properly, and even with the multiple ear pieces provided with this product I couldn't get them to stay in.

But the sound quality of the LG headset is average at best.  It misses the mark in bass and in overall richness in sound.

I am surprised that more headphone companies have not thought of this.On a 4 mile run, there was no clicked of the ear gel, like in the motorola bluetooth.

The wireless connectivity is a big advantage over wired headphones in my opinion and I own several Bluetooth earbuds for running.  However, I found that I was disappointed with the Plantronics BackBeat GO.The headset comes with instructions which detail how to pair the headsets with your devices, how to decipher the beeps that occur if you are on hold and the buttons.  Pairing was very easy.  There are chimes that play when you turn the headphones on and off which is a nice feature so that you know to release the on button.  However, the little indicator light on one of the headsets is impossible to find when it is not lit and so you need to be looking at both earbuds when you first pair to be able to find it.Personally, I was not a big fan of the fit of the headsets.  The earbuds come with three additional eartips to allow for a good fit.  There is also a stabilizer which can be added.  The instructions read that you are supposed to be able to put the rubber loop of the stabilizer into the area of your ear.  However, no matter which eartips you use, the earbuds do not register on your outer ear and so I found that they were not very stable no matter which eartips I used.  Moving my head would cause the earbuds to dislodge.  Even when in place, the earbuds were not very comfortable.  I would never wear them running, for example since they would become dislodged very quickly.The controls for the earbuds are located on the cord that runs between them.  I would have preferred that the controls were on one of the headsets.  The location of the controls puts them somewhere on the back of your neck when you have the earbuds in place.  Therefore, you have to feel around to find the controls.  You must do this blindly and at first it is just easier to take the headset off.  But, with time, you learn to figure out where the buttons are located by touch.The sound quality from the earbuds is disappointing.  I also found the earbuds to be disappointing when trying to make a phone call.  The person that I was speaking with complained about the clarity of my voice.  I disconnected and then paired with another set of Bluetooth earbuds and that time the person could hear me clearly.  Therefore, the problem was with the Plantronics earbuds.Overall, I would not recommend the Plantronics BackBeat GO wireless earbuds.  They are not comfortable to wear, the controls are awkward and the sound quality is poor.  Better options for Bluetooth headphones are available.  I would recommend considering theMotorola SF600 Wireless Sports Headphones - Retail Packaging - Blackwhich have far superior sound quality, fit and function than the Plantronics.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007MC6WGK" id="B007MC6WGK-review40" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-04:</strong> If you're looking for a tangle free, sporty, and hassle free headset than this is the one for you!

Notice they never say what stereo bluetooth product is actually "great" in comparison.  That's because have never used a stereo bluetooth headset before with noise cancelling before.  This product is pretty-much as good as it gets if you want hands-free noise-cancelling stereo bluetooth headphones.Note:  All noise cancelling bluetooth headsets are inherently going to be low volume.  Higher volumes would cause noise cancelling to not work correctly; hence, the limitation on volume amplification.If your ears are sensitive to loud sound, I doubt you're going to find a bluetooth stereo headset earbuds better than this.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007MC6WGK" id="B007MC6WGK-review43" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-04-17:</strong> I have searched far n wide to find the best portable headset but could not find one, until I saw this one. It is just perfect design and best portable bluetooth headset yet.1. Sound quality.Though it is not the best of the quality, but the quality is not depended on the headset alone, Same mp3 file played on different phones sound different. This is because the way the bluetooth stack is written for those devices. I tested it with several devices, the best I found was with HTC EVO and worst was iPhone 4. But still it is not all that bad.2. Wired headset vs bluetooth headset.Wired headset and bluethooth headsets are just different, it is like comparing apple (wired) and oranges(bluetooth) but both are fruits (headsets). Wired headset does not have to worry about the power, while the bluetooth headsets need to check the battery level to get that 4.5 hrs battery life.3. Battery Life.Right on the dot, 4.5 hrs, period.4. Portability.No question about portability, I have not tested it while jogging/running at the gym, for my usage, sitting at the table listening to the music while I write software has been working without a doubt.5. Phone headsetThese should not be used as a phone headset while driving, because of sound isolation, but while not driving these is a great headset to talk to.Con1. Lack of multiple paired devices.You need to repair every time you want to use with a new device, even if you have paired with it in the past. Usually the bluetooth headsets remembers at least last 4 paired devices.2. Only black.I hope they come with more colors and patterns.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007MC6WGK" id="B007MC6WGK-review44" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-30:</strong> I love the design on these - that they link together behind the head, and you can easily control volume and phone answering with a little set of buttons that hang near your neck.  There are three bud sizes, and they fit nicely in my ears and stay there even when I'm running. I know others have complained about the fit, but for me they've been fine.The sound is a bit more muddy than other earphones I've tried, even much less expensive plug-in earphones.  As others have noted, the bass quality is also very weak.  So I'd say these are not the best choice for the audiophile, and not the best choice if your primary purpose is to listen to music cord free.  On the other hand, they do sound well enough, and so if your main aim is hands-free calling, and you only listen to music every once in a while, these wouldn't be a bad way to go.  They work fine for calls, but perhaps the mike input is a bit low for receivers on the other end.I have noticed that they seem to stutter and drop Bluetooth signal a bit more frequently than other Bluetooth-enabled devices I've tried.  That has happened both with my phone and with my computer (note that unlike many other Bluetooth devices I've tried these can only be "paired" to one device at a time - so they wouldn't be useful if you wanted to pair them to your phone on a commute and then to your computer once you got to work).Overall, these are not bad, but I've tried better (likethisone that doesn't look as good as these but sounds and performs better at a lower cost; orthisone that sounds and performs quite a bit better but at a higher cost). The deal breaker for me is that the signal seems to cut out for a moment every so often.  I've had that happen every once in a random while with almost every Bluetooth device I've owned, but with this one it seems to be pretty regular.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007MC6WGK" id="B007MC6WGK-review45" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-06-18:</strong> I really like this wireless headset. It was easy to pair with my iPad and in no time I was able to watch a movie and move about my house (even go outside!) with no interference or loss of sound. I used to have aMotorola S9-HD Bluetooth MOTOROKR/MOTOACTIV Stereo Headset (Gloss Black) [Retail Packaging], that felt very masculine to me and didn't fit my ears right. The Plantronics headset doesn't fit as nicely as a regular headset, more like a stethoscope, but it's a more flexible fit. Also felt the cord was the right length. And the battery indicator was a nice touch (it beeps to let you know when the battery is about to die).Included with this set is nice variety of additional ear pieces and instruction manual.My complaints are only that I wish it fit better in my ear and didn't stick out so far. I wanted to try running with it, but for sure I know they will fall out unless I jam them in my ears. You can also only pair this headset with one device at a time. I tried pairing it with my iPad and iPhone and it was such a PAIN. Even when I disconnected my iPad Bluetooth setup and told it to Forget This Device, it still had trouble syncing with my iPhone. And then when I got it to work (I'm not even sure how I got it to finally work), I had a horrible time re-syncing it with the iPad; terribly frustrated, and the manual mentions nothing about this issue. Also wish you could rewind or fastforward using the controller.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007MC6WGK" id="B007MC6WGK-review46" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-07-13:</strong> I love the BackBeat GO, I think the sound is amazing considering it is coming from a Bluetooth earphones.  It used to be very hard to find earphones with BT.  BT Headphones are more common but lately BT is coming into the smaller and lighter earphones.  I don't like wearing something that goes around on top of my head, that's why I prefer the earphones.  Pairing it to my iPhone and iPod Touch was easy.I have another BT earphone which is made by Samsung, the HM3700.  I like it too but the BackBeat GO sound better and scores higher on the coolness factor.  The bass is solid on this one.One thing that I don't very much about it is the battery life.  I guess it is a compromise as the size and weight of a bigger battery will somewhat hamper the BackBeat's portability. The packaging is a bit over than what is necessary.  You need to be very careful removing the delicate earphones as they are tightly embedded into the plastic case.This kind of earphones is not for jogging or exercise activities; in-ear types tend to fall off when you move.  It is great for listening while commuting, or just relaxing on the couch.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007MC6WGK" id="B007MC6WGK-review47" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-02:</strong> Hi, really bad, are uncomfortable about having a lot of headset that gets into the ear, the sound is also bad, and low barely hear, buy 3 of these and 3 are equally bad.

Figured it would be convenient, but I just kept using the included wired buds because I was being too lazy to shop and order, plus too cheap to purchase to replace something that was working. Then my wife decided to help out: she broke my included iphone earbuds, and I figured that if I was going to get a new pair of headphones/whatever, now would be the time to research and get what I wanted.I had a basic idea of it: a BT headset that would be small and indiscrete, have decent sound quality, and as a bonus I'd LOVE to find one that let me listen to music. Why not, I was shopping for myself and hell that way I wouldn't have to juggle a headset/stereo headphones depending on the situation.I started my online research not knowing what I would find, I hadn't looked in this direction in almost a decade, and didn't even know if what I wanted existed. To my surprise there were TONS of BT stereo sets that also took calls. YAY! Only problem was that they were definitely too bulky for my tastes; I wanted something pocketable and discrete and easy to carry around without being inconvenient. Then I found these guys. I was intrigued because they were comparatively TINY, basically just regular wired earbuds without, you know, THE WIRE, so they'd stow really well. They were also really well rated at other dedicated electronics sites, so I started shopping.I was concerned about two things I kept reading: lack of volume, and ease of pairing/ease of use. Still I decided to try them as there were also a lot of positive reviews.For the first day or so I was very pleased with them. However by the 3rd day I was a little less enthusiastic. I wasn't sure if they were THAT convenient, more so than just a regular, small BT headset with boom mic, and worth the tradeoffs. I was THIS close to sending them back. But I decided to hold out just a little longer and not THINK about it so much, just use it. And I'm glad I did.YES, the volume is a little lower than I would have liked. Basically on my iphone I have to have the volume slider  at least 25% up to hear a damned thing. It does get louder quicker from there, but still not as loud as I would like. However this seems to be limited to the music only. On phone calls, volume is just fine. And since these are ear-sealing earbuds, my fears that ambient noise would drown out the device even at full volume were unfounded -- basically, the upper limits of the volume are just fine, as they do such a good job of sealing out unwanted noise from your surroundings, that it just about balances out.As far as the convenience factor... they pull out quickly and tangles are not an issue; as long as you can grab the bud and place it in your ear, the controls are right there to turn on/answer calls, so in all actuality they're just as convenient as an ordinary boom mic unit. For me I use the largest tips inlcuded, as I find this allows for a little better bass response. Took some getting used to, but if you give it a bit of time to to get adjusted and figure out what placement works best for you, it becomes much less of a chore and quicker and easier within a couple of days of use.Bottom line: They're a bit quieter than the wired iphone earbuds I replaced them with, they're maybe slightly less convenient than a regular BT headset to pull out and put to use, BUT: the convergence factor is AWESOME. they're LOUD ENOUGH, they are damned near as convenient if not identically so to using a regular BT boom mic, and as a plus you can also listen to music in stereo? Very little tradeoff, very much gained as far as I am concerned.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007MC6WGK" id="B007MC6WGK-review49" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-07-03:</strong> I have been using this headset with my Toshiba Thrive Tablet, and while I can't bring myself to rave about them due to some frustrating issues, there are some good points.Likes:- Decent sound when turned up on the headset itself (more on this in the Dislikes section below)- The noise-cancelling technology works well - almost too well (also more on this below)- Comfortable - my ears do not get sore inside after longer uses- The connecting wire is just long enough and doesn't kink up- The battery life is decent- I've never had a Bluetooth stereo headset before, and now I'm hooked on being able to move away from my tablet while watching video or listening to music with the headset!  More fun while cooking, cleaning, etc.!- The small spot for plugging in the charger is cleverly hidden on one of the earbudsDislikes:- When I turn the volume up on my device instead of the headset, I find the sound quality becomes thin, losing the lower decibels.  I have to keep the tablet volume turned as low as possible, and then only adjust the volume on the headset to avoid this issue.- I have to use the largest set of tips plus the stablizers, and these still don't stay in my ears well.  I push them in as far as possible, and figured out the inside-ear stablizers after some trial-and-error, but the soft, supple nature of the tips allows them to keep slipping out.  The only thing that ever seems to keep earbuds in my ears is small, comfortable hooks over the outside of the ear.  I guess I have large ear canals or something!  Unfortunately, hooks are not part of the options kit that comes with this particular headset.- I generally feel like I have my fingers plugging my ears when I'm wearing these.  Go ahead - plug your ears for a minute, and do some normal stuff, like chew, walk, and talk.  The way the sounds of those activities are amplified in my head while plugging my ears is the same as when wearing these earbuds.  Also, if something taps the wire (like an earring or my shirt collar), the sound is magnified greatly.- This plugged-ear sensation also makes it difficult to hear someone who walks up to talk to me - I either have to turn off the music/video (turning it down is not enough, even at the lowest level it's still difficult to hear someone else), or I have to take out one or both of the buds completely.I have found a lot of uses for this headset, and do enjoy being able to listen to my things without disturbing those around me.  However, I get frustrated by the earbuds sliding out of my ears, even when sitting still, and the plugged-ear-amplification issue is very distracting.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007MC6WGK" id="B007MC6WGK-review50" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-07-26:</strong> Ditto others comments.  Ultimate convenience.  Useful for exercise and running like wired earbuds.  But low base response unless really pushed deeply into your ear (which does not stay).  Helps to adjust equalizer on your phone, if available, for stereo music playing.  Talk AND Stereo bluetooth playing time is 3 hrs max.  Tried to use it on cross-continent flight for movie viewing on a tablet but lost power into third hour.  With volume on tablet/phone and unit at max, can barely hear in some situations (plane, walking, etc).

Once I walk outside I might as well just remove my headphones because the sound cuts out so often that the music is not enjoyable. Luckily, THESE PLANTRONICS HEADPHONES HAVE GREAT RECEPTION. I am so happy. I previously tried the Jabra SPORT and Motorola SF600. Both had a few merits but terrible reception.Plantronics:Pros:Reception: Excellent reception (I know I keep going on about this but it's a really big deal to me and they excel). I really don't think I've had these cut out on me once when they're within 10-15 feet of my phone.Controls: The controls are on the cord which I really like. With the other headphones the controls are located on the actual units instead of the cord. Because of this I always felt like I was pushing my ear around when I reached for buttons. With the controls on the cord this is not an issue.Cord Length: Some reviewers have mentioned that they think it is too long but I think it's just right. The cord is long enough that it doesn't rub my neck all the time. Also, when I remove the buds from my ears I can just drape the cable over my neck so they're available quickly when I want to wear them again.Pairing: As with any BT device these pair easily the first time. However, they also seem well programmed and pair with devices after that too. Seems obvious but not every BT headset is so streamlined.Cons:Sound Quality: This is tough because the reception somewhat makes up for this. However, the plain truth is that the sound quality is only so-so. The bass is definitely lacking (and I'm not a pure basshead). The trebles and midrange are pretty nice. Personally, I like the sound of the Motorola models better but would still choose Plantronics for reception reasons. For a comparison, my daily headphones are Ultimate Ears SuperFi 5 Pros. It's not a fair to compare these two but I do care about music quality.Battery Life: Acceptable but not excellent. I generally get a couple of solid hours out of them but nowhere near the 4 hours that they advertise.Fit: If you're sitting in one room not moving much then the fit is pretty decent. However, if you are outside moving around a lot then these can pretty easily get jarred from your ears. I'm seriously considering making some foam buds to replace the silicon that come from the factory.Final verdict: Pretty good compared to the competition that I've tried. If the bass response/sound quality and fit were better I'd easily give 5 stars. As is, they earn a very solid 4.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007MC6WGK" id="B007MC6WGK-review57" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-13:</strong> Light and easy to use.

They also have some sort of noise cancelling effect but only if the place is not extremely (a train station for example) noisy but it does the job at the library or at the study room when the other students are having a group session or just talking in the lounge. The fact that can sleep with them was a great plus. I work out with them and did not experience the sweat problem other were having and yes I do sweat a lot but after a while I avoided use them for gym not because of the sweat but they would constantly popped off my ear if I am doing some cardio and all. That for me is extremely negative point which resulted in the 2 stars drop. I have to constantly push them in my ears and really insist in pushing them in. No with the tear and wears of the past months the stabilisers are good for nothing. They do not help anymore. Another thing I do not like is the fact that battery life kept on decreasing as the months passed by. Brand new was like 2,5-3 hours of audio and 4 hours stand by. Now it is much less like an 1-2 hours audio and 2.5-3 hours stand by. So I would say that the battery life is another negative point and this lead to a drop of 1 additional star because the earbuds are small so it is expected that the battery life would not be that great but the fact they did not allow us to charge on laptops and obliged to always carry around the charger and find a charging outlet which is of great inconvenience if you commuting.lastly ending this review with a positive point is that the product wire does not get tangled. Well after a few months after purchasing these I noticed they released a new version of the product hopefully it will be better. Would I recommend it? Well yes if you don't mind taking into consideration these negative points.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007MC6WGK" id="B007MC6WGK-review67" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-28:</strong> Durable construction.

I got it for holding my Droid Razr phone, and it does a good job of it.  The range of sizes the clip will hold are a bit broader than stated in the specifications for the large (L):  I measure 2.25 inches up to just over 3.5 inches.  I'm guessing that Case's other sizes are similarly understated, so I probably could have gotten one with a smaller clip, but this works great.The legs are easy to bend and straighten, and the feet have a slightly rubbery feel that gives them some grip.  The contact points of the clip are also rubbery so that they securely hold your phone without scratching it.  By adjusting the feet, I can shoot at a very steep downward angle without toppling the tripod.My only complaint is that the clip has some wobble to it where it screws onto the base, even when it is screwed in all the way (it feels like the threads are stripped).  This makes the phone bounce when I touch it, but because of the shutter delay, there doesn't seem to be any effect on photos or videos.Overall, I'm very pleased with this tripod, and I wish I'd bought one sooner.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CR74FLY" id="B00CR74FLY-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-10:</strong> This is the 3rd one I've bought.

The second one I ordered arrived a few days ago from a company in TX. Last time I ordered the absolute least expensive one. Unlike the last one, the new one did not look exactly like picture but fit well. Full area around camera in back was cut out so instead of basically two holes at the top as pictured, it has one big one. Not a big issue.  Bigger disappointment was how slick the new one is. Less "rubberized" on the outside than the old one. Slides around a lot more in the car. For the price, it's still great. I really thought about getting a red silicone one but couldn't seem to find one for the D4. For other phones, they seem to run $20 or more. I can buy one of these cases every year for much longer than I will keep this phone, I think, and be money ahead.Update - 26 Oct. - At this point, the top trim no longer secures. The tabs holding it on are too brittle/flimsy broke off about after 2.5 months and won't stay on. I continued to use just the back cover, but it's tabs are losing their grip, too. I guess time for something else...I haven't dropped it enough to have justified the tabs deteriorating like they have.

I was frustrated that I had to purchase it, but very happy with it's function.I love the callpod chargepod, which is a round hub with 6 "spokes" of chargers sticking out of it. I have not found a single one my my rechargable electronics for which there is no callpod adapter. I felt that the default adapter's included with the callpod were not the best choice. So before purchasing a callpod make sure you count the cost of all of the spokes that you will purchase; they usually will cost you between seven and ten bucks apiece. But for me that is worth it.My life is a tangle of cords and the callpod chargepod works to fix that. I keep my six devices (usually two blackberries, an ipod, two bluetooth headsets, and an Amazon Kindle) charging in a self-contained circle without cords going everywhere and without the use of a powerstrip. Then when I travel, I can connect those same device to the car charger using the car power adapter. And in a hotel room, I can charge all my devices (including any that charge via usb using the usb adapter) without bringing tons of cords.

You just hit the two buttons on the side and your phone is instantly released. And then when you want to mount your phone you just press it into the cradle and it snaps closed. It's the best design I've ever seen on any mount.Another thing is the suction cup. Most vehicle mounts that have a suction cup are only designed for the window. And if you can avoid the bumps in the road eventually it's been a falloff. But the iOttie is something else there gel-based suction cup works amazingly well.  Even on dashboards which kind of blew my mind that it works so well. And it's just nice because it gives you more options over securing it to your window. Mine hasn't fallen off in over a week.The last thing I like is the reach of the unit. You can really get your phone close to you because the arm is so long. But it can also be pushed in if you want to have a further away. It's a really nice design.This is going to be the dock I recommend to my friends/family/customers from here on out.

Sticking the base of this holder onto a side window, extending the holder to its maximum length and positioning the holder horizontally puts my phone at the right height to view while driving yet not be in the way.Pressing my phone into the holder causes the grippers on this holder to automatically snap and secure my phone.  Squeezing the release buttons allows the phone to fall into my hand.  The ease with which I can secure and remove my phone does not distract from my driving.Sometimes the strong grippers will press the volume control on the side of my phone and shut down the audio, but a minor adjustment of the phone's position resolves that problem.

I was recently sent a sample of this newer model, and it's quite an improvement. Both models have a super sticky gel pad, and the one I've been using all these months has never budged from where it's mounted. It was a good solution for one of my vehicles, but I was waiting for something better to come along for another vehicle.This mount offers several improvements that make it better suited to my needs. For starters, both satisfy a basic need in that they can mount to a dashboard on a textured surface with an irregular shape. Not only does that put devices in a more convenient position, it also puts it in a legal one. In my state it's not legal to stick it to a windshield. This model has an extension so that I can move a device several inches forward, and even place the device below dashboard level with the mount on the dashboard. The range of motion is very large.The cradle itself is easy to use with one hand. Placing a device on it causes the arms to snap in place, and a one handed squeeze releases it. Unlike many I've used in the past, there's no chance of the mount or cradle coming off by accident when a device is removed.For me, the only negative is that the base doesn't swivel. It makes it harder to place the mount so that the device can be pivoted from the driver to the passenger and back. After my initial positioning, I had to remove it and mount it with the lightest of pressure until I was able to go through all the adjustments and assure they were optimal for me. Then I was able to press the tab into the second position and secure the device. It's not trivial to remove the device, nor is it a chore or anything that will damage your dashboard. It left no sticky residue. But it's not something you'd want to do each time you want to make an adjustment. Fortunately, mounting it a single time should give enough room for adjustment for just about any driver. But for a large SUV or even a minivan, your passenger might prefer to use a device in hand and then return it to the cradle.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00JRGOKQ8', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00JRGOKQ8', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00821NSJ4</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00821NSJ4</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00821NSJ4" id="B00821NSJ4-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-18:</strong> This product is much better than an otter box.

After fully charging the battery, it didn't take very long to drain it to critical (about 3 hours or so) which was the very reason why I decided to get a &#34;new&#34; battery.  Whether this is an issue with my phone, I cannot be sure.  What I DO know, is that it did not perform the way I would expect a new battery to perform.

In my Samsung Captivate with Serendipity 7 custom rom installed I have plenty of widgets but the battery will last a full day plus some.  Since i have had my phone for around 5 months, the battery now last around 10 hours.  So I am replacing my old battery (i currently have two, a new one and one that came with a Samsung charger stand I purchased) that originally came with my phone.Like another reviewer stated, I received a EB575152VU instead of a EB575152VA.  It was packaged in a plastic bag, and it had a newer date on the battery (May 2011). The battery looked like a real samsung battery, just the wrong model number. The battery's white water damage indicator was showing xxxxx across the top indicating that the battery was damaged due to water.  However i figured that it was re-manufactured so I tried out the battery and it does work on my captivate, however the battery will not charge through the phone!  the phone will shutoff if you even try to charge it.  Since i can't charge it, ended up returning the battery.My order was through Alpha INC. who has recently changed their names to Emerald LLC.  It was fulfilled through Amazon so please do NOT buy from Alpha or Emerald!  Amazon of course was helpful in getting a refund.  Their advice for finding a real samsung battery was to try out another seller... lol.  I ended up just getting this off ebay, but these batteries are only $30 from Samsung's official store.Conclusion: Be careful who you order from, and make sure it is NOT Alpha INC. or Emerald LLC.  Good luck!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003X9XKPC" id="B003X9XKPC-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-24:</strong> The product came to me late, had some charge on it .

I had been eyeing it since I heard about it on a tech show. I finally decided to take the leap since my wife and I bought our house a year ago and I can't hear my cell phone ringing when I put it in another room or more commonly, forget to turn the ringer back on after coming home from work. My wife has had to reach me about important, time-sensitive matters numerous times and I checked my phone hours later to find I had missed about 10 calls from her. The device connects to up to 3 different phones at once, but since it is only my wife and I, we only use 2. Each line has a priority, so when dialing out, it will start by trying the phone in slot 1, then 2 and finally 3. If you don't want to dial out through line 1, then you can dial *2 or *3 and then dial normally and the gateway will dial out through the respectively connected phone (all explained in the instructions).  We both use the Blackberry 8330 Curve, which each use Bluetooth version 2.0. We keep our gateway in the bedroom since that is the most convenient place for us and we get a full strength tower signal throughout our house. There is a usefulness of placing it in a room that gets the best tower signal and then connecting your phone line from there (i.e. bedroom 1 gets no signal, but bedroom 2 gets great signal from the cell towers).You can connect your landline handsets to the gateway in 1 of 2 ways. The simplest method is to plug your phone right into the gateway and since most cordless phones come with multiple handsets, it's very easy to then disperse the extra handsets to convenient places throughout the house. The other method of landline connection involves disconnecting your home from the phone company and then plugging the gateway into any phone jack, which then gives all other phone jacks in your house a connection. I haven't been successful in accomplishing this method, but the telephone we have had 3 different handsets, so it was not a big issue. The disconnect process is not explained by the Xlink company (for liability reasons), but if you search for something like VOIP my house, you'll find it. It is the same process.Since we keep our phones in the same room (approx 6-8 feet) from the Xlink gateway, we have no sound quality problems. If we have our cell phones in a different room than the gateway however, there will be crackling & distortion until we put our cell phones closer to the gateway.One of the great features of this device is it allows my wife and I to be on the same cell phone line at the same time if we need to speak to the same person at the same time.There are a few quirks I've found, but don't really bother me and I still give it a 5 star rating.1. When your cell phone is out of range of the gateway, the corresponding light/button on top will blink until it is back in range. (You can click the light/button and it will shut off, but that means it will not reconnect when the phone is back in range, unless you click it again)2. While you can use a built in address book feature to dial out on land line handsets, it will only work on the first cell phone connected, so consider which phone should be connected in slot 1, 2 and 3 (i.e. Phone 1 can dial out using built in address book, but phone 2 can't dial out using the built in address book when phone 1 is in range, you have to dial *2 then the phone number (manually) to dial out when phone 1 is connected).3. The light buttons on top are a fairly bright blue. That may bother some people, but not us.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00135XU7Q" id="B00135XU7Q-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-17:</strong> Easy to set up and connects easily and automatically to my cell phone (Samsung Galaxy S4). I haven't tried using multiple cell lines. I love that the land-line phone rings like a regular land line, and I love that I can dial out with an antique rotary phone. It's like it's 1950 again at my desk. But the audio quality is substandard, which seems to be a real issue with Bluetooth; I've had many Bluetooth headsets and almost all of them have bad audio. How difficult can it be, when phone audio is so limited in the bandwidth it needs? It's not like 7-channel movie audio or something. The audio improves after the first few seconds of the call, for whatever reason, and people at the other end sometimes comment on the &#34;bad connection&#34; and sometimes don't. So maybe it's like 1950 again in terms of the audio quality too.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00135XU7Q" id="B00135XU7Q-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-06-23:</strong> (Using with iPhones)  I discontinued my home phone service and my wife and I just were using our cell phones.  I then heard about this type of technology that connected your home land phones with your cell phone.  Figured I would give it a try.  AWESOME!  Just unplug your land phone line from the wall and plug it into this bluetooth.  Turn your cell phone bluetooth on discoverable mode.  It connects to the Xlink easily and you're ready to go!  I read that you want the other version - the "N" version if you want to continue to use a land line phone service at the same time.  The only limitation of this unit the bluetooth technology.  All bluetooth devices need to be in a decent range of each other to connect.  My Xlink is in my kitchen.  I start to get a crackle on the line if the phone is ~30 feet away in my bedroom.  But anywhere within ~20 feet, the line is clear.  Thus I simply leave my phone in this general area.  When I want to make a call, I pick up any of the cordless phones I have that are connected to the base (there are 4), and I simply dial.  The phone uses the cell every time and makes the call.  When receiving a call, the cordless phone displays the caller ID without any problems.  This thing is GREAT.  Definitely no need for my regular phone service now...**** UPDATE **** UPDATE... WELL, after 6 months of use, my opinion on this has changed.  My review above still is valid... It links up just fine with your bluetooth enabled phone as I described and once linked, it works fine.  BUT HERE IS THE PROBLEM... Imagine that you're relaxing by the TV and a phone call come in on your cell phone.  So you pick up YOUR CELL and answer and start talking.  30 seconds (or other random time) into your conversation, you realize that you cannot hear the other person now!  You look down and see that the phone is now connected to the Xlink.  You hopefully switch back quick enough before the person on the line gets upset and hangs up...OR you're coming home from work while talking on your cell phone and pull into the garage... and then the Xlink connects and you no longer have the conversation going on your cell.  You may be able to click over, but sometimes you don't realize that it has if you are the one talking.Well, this happened to myself and my wife so many times, that we eventually gave up and just TURNED THIS THING OFF.  I tried to keep using this for a while... but it became too frustrating!!!  I'm too far out of the return period... I wish I would have returned it when I could have.OVERALL, IT'S A GREAT CONCEPT AND MAY WORK WELL AT TIMES, BUT IT WILL BECOME FRUSTRATING FOR YOU IF YOU STILL PLAN TO USE YOUR CELL PHONE FOR A PORTION OF THE TIME.  IF YOU WANT TO USE THIS... YOU'LL LIKELY NEED TO SIMPLY PUT YOUR PHONE DOWN NEAR THE XLINK AND *ONLY USE YOUR HOME PHONES*.  Unfortunately my initial smart investment has failed and I'm out of luck.  BUT luckily I found a good alternative!

But in the new house, there's always quirky spots (my signal is good at my desk, but my new cell phone doesn't realize I answered the call -wierd).  And some people reading this may have dead zones.  Enter the Xlink.I read about the Panasonic KX-TH1212B in Consumer Reports and saw how they liked it, and I always like Panasonic products.  But reading some of the reviews online here, I questioned if I may also experience issues.

I put the box at the cell phone chargers, where cell signal is perfect and issue free.  I plugged it up to my Panasonic cordless phones (I call them networked - where you have one plugged into jack and others one their charger but not plugged in wall throughout the house), and there have been no issues.When you have the cell phone past the 10ft range from box instructed, you will get some static.  Easy solution - move the cell phone into range.  I liked that I read you could plug up the box and firmware upgrade at no charge for future cell models.On my cordless handsets, I have numbers programmed, and the handset speaks those names.  If an unrecognized call comes in, then it shows up as 'Xlink BT', but I have no issue with that.  I bought this fron ANTonline through Amazon, and have had nothing but good things to say.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00135XU7Q" id="B00135XU7Q-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-01-16:</strong> I had struggled for over three years trying to get acceptable VOIP performance with my DSL connection from Qwest.  For two years, I went back and forth between my VOIP provider (AT&T; Callvantage) and Qwest DSL with no resolution.  But since AT&T; was pulling the plug on their VOIP service anyway, I tried Qwest VOIP.  Surely since VOIP and DSL were both being provided by the same company, they would get it sorted out.  40 hours of my time, two service visits, multiple hardware reconfigurations, multiple QoS setups; they really tried, but ultimately we both gave up.  Even though I had a really clean 3.0 mbps DSL line, somehow it could not support an acceptable phone conversation if anyone on my three computer network was doing anything- just clicking on a webpage was enough to break up the call.I was on the verge of giving up and going back to POTS when I happened across this in a VOIP forum.  I'm on a family plan with Verizon and get excellent signal coverage in my home, so I added a line, ported my VOIP number to it and used an older LG cell I had as a dedicated phone for the Xlink.  I have it sitting right next to the Xlink and have it plugged into its charger.  Works perfectly.  And costs me just $12/mo with taxes.  Another benefit is when we travel, we just bring the cell with us and can answer calls to our home phone as if we were there.  Sound quality has been generally excellent as long as you don't expect miracles- if you are talking to someone on another cell, you are going to have the quality of cell to cell as the best you can expect.  But cell to landline calls have been really clear (the LG I'm using has really robust call quality).One final comment to another reviewer, who hoped a future firmware upgrade would provide names on caller ID instead of saying XLink; you have to remember this device is limited to cell phone protocols- cell phones have never provided the names of the callers (unless they're in your phonebook).  And there's no consistent way to extract that info from your cell and display it on your home phones.  However, if you get a multi-handset portable phone like ones from Panasonic, AT&T; or Uniden, if the number calling is in their shared phonebook then you will see it on your caller ID.(I understated this device may be made by Siemens who has just brought out an identical device with their own name on it.  Since Xlink spent the money to pave the way for people to understand and benefit from this technology, I would like to suggest buyers continue to support them by buying their version.)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00135XU7Q" id="B00135XU7Q-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-09-22:</strong> I got this,and set it up easily. At FIRST,it seemed great- I hate holding the cell phone,and I could use my old cordless phones,and answer them easily. SOund could be a bit staticky,but I could live with that...HOWEVER.... AFter 2-3 months of use, it is SO glitchy. It works randomly,usually not working at all,even though the blue lights show it is supposed to be paired.  ***At first,I wrote this review about how I disliked this- but I figured out that if I unplug it, and plug it back in after 30 seconds,it reboots and works properly again. AFter having it for a year+, I have had to do this about every month or so. Once I got that down, no problem-it's great! so, if you don't mind doing this,it's a good option.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00135XU7Q" id="B00135XU7Q-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-03:</strong> Old cell phone plus a TruPhone SIM makes this a great device for a secondary or backup phone line for my security devices to call out on.

Works as promised. Connection quality is contingent with your cellular connection quality.  ie: if your cell service connection quality is good it matches up when using a phone connected to the Xlink.  If you cell service connection is poor the Xlink connection quality also matches.  My cellular service quality in my location is &#34;OK&#34; but not crystal clear, continuously solid, perfect.  In short - the Xlink Bluetooth Gateway is great for increasing your usage of your cell phone service.  I have it connected to a multi-handset landline cordless phone and it works fine.  I can answer my cell phone on any one of them, wherever they are in the house, and the clarity and quality of the call is equal to answering my cell phone.  One major advantage is the comparatively better comfort of the landline handsets, which is more ergonomically designed.  Disadvantage, of course, is that moving around or going to a &#34;better&#34; location to improve signal quality does nothing when on the Bluetooth connected landline phone handset as the cell phone is what is getting the actual signal and is stationary.  All in all - I rate this as an excellent product but only gave it 4 stars because it can't work miracles and improve on what it has to work with (your existing cell service connection quality).  Although those lucky enough to have a crystal clear, solid cell connection at their home location would rate a 5 star review, most of us do not so a fair review - though not the shortcoming of the Xlink - is 4 stars, because having a cell service connection is contingent on its use.  I do however recommend it except in the worst cellular service connection locations.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00135XU7Q" id="B00135XU7Q-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-09:</strong> We've been using our Xlink BT for a week now after ditching our landline. Our setup is Xlink + Vtech DECT6 6-handset wireless system + 2 iPhones (4S & 5). The Xlink and Vtech base unit are set up in our kitchen where we get 2-3 bars consistently on AT&T.; We have our chargers right there too. Our 6 wireless handsets on the Vtech are working flawlessly with the Xlink. Set-up was a no-brainer. I upgraded the unit as instructed, via Windows PC, but others have said it wasn't necessary.I want to explain what's happening with Caller ID, because that was a concern for us. CallerID from AT&T; doesnt come thru on our wireless handsets like it (still) does on our iPhones. But if a caller is in our iPhone Contacts, we get the caller name and the number calling us on all 6 handsets on our system. If not, we get "Xlink BT" and the number. So when you get this device, it will force you to tidy up your Contacts and add numbers for people who call you but aren't in there.Call quality has been exactly the same on our home handsets as on our iPhones. No callers have said they were not hearing us well. Our phones quickly reconnect to the system, when we enter the garage. I've also noticed that our connect range seems to be at least 40 feet, but I havent tested the handset call quality at that distance.We love it that now we can voice dial via Siri from 8 phones instead of just our 2 iPhones. And I can even leave my cell in my purse near the base unit to make sure I don't forget to take it with me.We were paying $50 a month for our landline's nonstop telemarketer calls. The Xlink will pay for itself after the first month. Now there's no reason to keep a landline. If you have a security system, get cellular backup. You should have that anyway. It costs us more for monitoring, but is more secure. And you're not duplicating phone service, so that cell phone bill looks more reasonable.I highly recommend Xlink BT. If you already have decent cellular reception in your home or apartment, you won't be disappointed!UPDATE: Just a few days after I wrote the above, my iPhone 5 is not reconnecting with the Xlink when I come back into range. I have to knock a star off my review for that. Now I have to remember to reconnect it, but at least it's in a prominent place where I notice those blue lights. No similar problem with my husband's iPhone 4S. This may be due to the recent Apple iOS update, hard to tell.UPDATE 2: Now a couple days later and iPhone 5 is reconnecting right away with the Xlink after I come back home. I have read that there have been issues with the phone and bluetooth, so I'm upping my review back to 5 stars. Any disconnect I think must be Apple's fault!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00135XU7Q" id="B00135XU7Q-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-09-28:</strong> Great product so you can use the land line phones in your house when all you have is a cell phone.

Everything should be this easy. You can connect up to three Blueooth enabled cell phones to the unit. Calls are very clear and static free, just be sure you place the unit and your cell phone in an area of your house where you get a good cell phone signal. The more bars, the better. Also, be sure to place your cell phone close to the Xlink, again, the closer the better. All I can say is WOW! One drawback... caller ID will show the phone number but not the callers name. It shows the caller's name as XLink. It could be just my phones though and not the Xlink.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00135XU7Q" id="B00135XU7Q-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-03-04:</strong> Excellent product.

I tried it twice in the past but never seemed to benefit and work successfully. A while back there was a software upgrade that is currently used in this purchase. Apparently it made all the difference.I had used VoIP, which is a Internet connected phone system rather than the old wired system of AT&T;, technically called a POTS. Comcast is an example of such a service in their phone bundled package. After 8 years of network and local Comcast issues, I gave up on that technology in favor of the full usage of my cell phone only. Xtreme was my most practical choice given what was available and my budget.I improved the performance of my local cell signal, by purchasing a home repeater system, after assuring myself of the functionality of this Bluetooth technology. I connected the output to my base wireless phone system, and now have my whole house phone system working without the bugs I had in the 8 years of VoIP service, and without the wired cost of the At&T; or Verizon charges, assuming you can still find real wired services anymore. I haven't looked back!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00135XU7Q" id="B00135XU7Q-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-04:</strong> I'm quite interested in antiques. So i purchased myself a rotary phone. Problem is, i don't have a wired phone line that supports rotary phone pulse dialing. I tried getting a magic jack, but of course that doesn't support pulse dialing either. So i eventually bought this. If you want to use a rotary dial phone, this is a great thing to have. I connect Xlink to my cellphone and use the rotary phone to call it. I use the rotary dial to input the number i want to call, and my cell phone, connected by bluetooth, recieves those numbers from Xlink and begins to call. at that point, it works like any other rotary dial phone. When you hang up, it hangs up on the cell phone as well. I've only got a few complaints regarding this product.Pros:-Great if you have a rotary dial phone and only cell phone service available. Or if your phone company doesn't support pulse dialing.Cons:- Poor quality. it's not horrendous, it's manageable. Just irritating to have a small bit of distortion in the phone line. Might be the phone or the bluetooth connection, hard to tell since i've never used this phone on an actual phone line before.- Irritating blinking light. I keep this in my room and i like to keep it on so that if someone calls me, i can hear the phone ringing. Unfortunately, that blinking light irritates the crap out of me when i'm trying to sleep. so i usually end up turning it off, which is unfortunate.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00135XU7Q" id="B00135XU7Q-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-07:</strong> I had a cobra  unit before and bluetooth did not reconnect all the time this one works great with out fail and no problem setting up.  good buy</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00135XU7Q" id="B00135XU7Q-review19" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-03:</strong> It came on timeIt works properlyIt connected my cell in an easy wayNice device to have at home in order to use the cell via cordless phone</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00135XU7Q', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00135XU7Q', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B006M2QR16</h2>    <p class="price"> $B006M2QR16</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006M2QR16" id="B006M2QR16-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-11:</strong> i ordered this and a month later it finally came in. when i opened the package the item was already broken. i contacted the seller the same day & was informed that i would have another one sent to me, but i never recieved it. i wouldn't recommend anyone to buy this item.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006M2QR16" id="B006M2QR16-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-03:</strong> I got this case today, and it came in a ripped up package and when I opened the package the case was all messed up, it's hard to get on and off and the head thingy to hold it together is broke so the head doesn't really stay on that good and one of the ears don't come out when you push the hair on the top of his head.

But since Moto Maker was not available on the X on Verizon at time of purchase, I went with the Maxx.  I was also considering the HTC One, but after reading so many positive reviews on this, I was sold.  There are so many features that are available on the Maxx that are not available on the other high end phone that are not gimicky features.Pros:-Active Notifications, can't live without this.  Why didn't anybody think of this?-Always listening "OK GOOGLE NOW",-Battery life the best in the business.  Verizon claims 48 hrs, I got about 24 hrs of heavy usage. No other phone even comes close.-This phone has buttery smooth interface.  So I guess quad cores are overrated.  Had this phone almost 2 months & it has not frozen or re-booted on me yet.-Build quality is the best in the business.  Kevlar backing is as premium as it gets & the phone just looks & feels like it put together perfect.-Speaker is loud & clear-Quick action camera with twist of the wrist twice is very conveinent (Twisting it 3X always works for me)-Motorola Migrate.  Allowing you to transfer all your storage on your old phone to the new phone.  Simple as downloading the app on your old phone.-Motorola Connect.  It alerts you when you have a text or call on your computer running Google Chrome.Cons:-Screen is only 720 & not 1080 like most high end phones, but to tell the truth I can't tell the difference.-Subpar camera-No removable battery or storage, but I think most are heading towards this direction.-High price $300 on contract-exclusive only on Verizon.

I upgraded from the Razr M, a device I really, really liked.  The M is small with a good sized screen, and extremely tough.  I had no case or screen cover on it and dropped in countless times and it still worked flawlessly.  I upgraded to the Maxx because I was due, and I have kind of wanted a phone with a bigger screen ever since trying a Galaxy S3 a year ago (which I returned after a few days because I absolutely hated it).  So enter the Droid Maxx.  I know my way around phones, but am not an IT guy, so I'll bullet why I love the Maxx from the perspective of a 'regular guy' user:-Screen feels huge, but the phone doesn't.  Why?  I have no idea.  I lined it up with a Galaxy S4 and it's the same size, but it feels smaller to me for some reason.-The operating system is pretty close to native Droid.  It doesn't have a bunch of added stuff like Samsung and HTC put on their phones.  What it means is the thing works flawlessly.  One of the things I hated about the G3 was random applications would open for no apparent reason, and all the stupid tips and tricks loaded by Samsung felt like those old HP desktop computers when you first booted them up.-Simple to get up and running.  Two exchange mailboxes and one gmail was an absolute piece of cake to get going.-Battery life is nuts, but by now everyone knows this-Device feels really tough, like my old M.  I can put it in my back pocket and sit on it with no worries.  The S3 always felt about to break.-Feels good in the hand, heavy but not too heavy.  Yes it costs more, but I have no idea why someone would buy an Ultra for a tiny weight savings considering the battery life on this one.-Google now.  You program your own voice, then say "OK Google" and the phone will wake up and you can get directions, set appointment, call or text without picking it up.  Very useful when driving-Call quality is excellent (Verizon)-Quirks:  Has none.  Not yet anyway.  Doesn't randomly get hot like the Galaxy did, doesn't freeze up (like the Galaxy did on the 2nd day), etc. etc.-I'm a gmail/Google guy, so if you have a gmail account, this thing synchronizes everything very well.  Probably not unlike an iPhone with iTunes.  It offers a lost phone/wipe service for free, which I really like.  I had a third party one on my M, but it's nice having all this stuff linked to gmail.  If I lose my phone, I don't have to remember what I did with the third party website, how to log in, etc.The two things about this smart phone that I suppose you could consider as negative are that it's not very exciting looking like the HTC One or S4.  Looks like a garden variety, generic Droid.  But I don't care.  If you do, get a prettier phone.  The second is the lack of an SD slot.  This is a  non factor to me though, as the device has 32G of memory.  By the time I come close to needing that much space it will be several years, and I will have upgraded by then. In fact, to me native memory is easier than using an  SD anyway.  So in conclusion:  The Droid Maxx is, in my opinion, BY FAR the best Droid device, and probably the best smart phone currently available.  CNET calls it the best Droid, so they agree.  My wife has an iPhone 5s and you can't compare Apple to Droid anymore.  iPhones are great; they always work and are super easy, but from a technological and configuration standpoint there really isn't any comparison.  And now that Google owns Motorola, I'll bet these devices keep getting better and better.If you are an iPhone user tired of Apple's schtick, you could do a lot worse than a Droid Maxx.UPDATE:  It's been about three weeks, which is plenty of time to have discovered quirks or things I don't like.  And I have found none.  Not one.  This smartphone is amazing.  I bought the Speck brand case and a screen cover, and am absolutely thrilled.  All the apps run great, and the battery is just plain crazy.  I got three days out of it last week.  Even when it is down to 8% or so, there is still plenty of time left for a few more calls.  To get the three days I turned it off at night by the way.  If left on, two full days is a realistic expectation.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00E9W8Q1A" id="B00E9W8Q1A-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-20:</strong> Went from a basic phone to my first Smart Phone.  Did a ton of research before purchasing, got down to three and ended up picking the Motorola Droid Maxx.  The memory and battery life sold me, not to mention the size of the screen, which compared to my old basic touch phone is awesome.  The quality of this phone is outstanding.  Not to mention Amazon Free 2-day shipping, along with the best price around on this phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00E9W8Q1A" id="B00E9W8Q1A-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-23:</strong> My wife and I both decided to switch to the Droid Maxx in February 2014, and we love them.I'll keep it simple, since others have written way more in-depth reviews that are better than I could write.- Obviously, we'd mention the battery life. We usually get two days per charge, which is way better than we had with our old Galaxy S2s. I took screenshots when I had this thing still going at 3% after 2 days and 20 hours. Of course, that was pretty minimal usage those three days, but I hadn't been trying to make it last that long.- Awesome design and feel to the phone (why cover that with a case?)- People may say the processor isn't the best, but I love the way it functions, separating different functions onto different cores and chunks of memory.- We absolutely LOVE that the camera is only a &#34;doorknob twist&#34; away. I was worried about the camera before buying, because that was the one place I constantly saw the Droid Maxx marked down, and my wife wanted a good camera. I'm glad to report, I'm not disappointed with the camera at all. No settings to adjust, and as long as you give it a few seconds to adjust to the lighting, it does a good job with the auto settings. You just tap the screen to snap a shot, and you can even snap shots while taking video. We are very happy with the camera.- The Command Center Widget is Awesome!!I guess a couple negatives I've found:- Limited case selection (see comments at the end of review for my ongoing case search).- Verizon Exclusive (although, to be honest, our experience is switching from T-Mobile has been- Google is selling Motorola (which in the end, I think will be best for both companies), just feels like an uncertain time for right now.Pros & Cons of (nearly) Stock Android:- You don't have a whole lot of extra bloatware on your phone... Minimal Verizon apps, IMDB, and an NFL app is forced on us (Who still cares about football these days?).- Missing some advanced functionality in certain areas, but at least the additional apps you download to get this functionality are all of your own choosing.- Can't remove unused homescreens- No simple button for Screen Auto Rotate. I would imagine this would be in the options under the notifications settings section, but you have to navigate into settings and display to reach this option. Additional widget apps tend to be large, and I don't want to install one just for that button.- Stock Alarm clock can adjust exactly how long the alarm snoozes from 1-30 mins, but the option for how long the alarm goes off has a list from 5-30 mins in 5 minute increments. Who needs a five-minute alarm (or for that matter, anything longer than five-minutes)?- The text messaging app lacks the option to schedule a time to send a message which is something I use quite often.- Another downside to texting with Verizon is media messages can't be sent over wifi, so you're stuck using your precious data.Anyway, none of this really has to do with the Maxx, specifically.Final Thoughts. The title says it all. We love the phones and wish Google had taken better care of Motorola.Case Comments:There aren't many cases (name brand or otherwise), and they're challenging to find due to the repetitive names in the series (Droid RAZR Maxx, RAZR Maxx HD, Droid Maxx...). Good luck with that (we're still looking for decent cases, I'll update this area if I find one I really like).We've tried:- Diztronic Flexible TPU cases (Black and Pink Glitter). The feel is okay, but the sides are too flexible and it peels off our screen protectors.- OtterBox Commuter case (Black). Great protection, but not comfortable to hold due to added bulk and the slick plastic shell. Lip around the screen makes Back, Home and Recent buttons difficult to touch, and the power and volume buttons are also harder to press.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00E9W8Q1A" id="B00E9W8Q1A-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-06:</strong> Great battery life, never need to re-charge it to get through a day no matter what I do with it.

I came from Galaxy Nexus, then Galaxy S3, then HTC DNA, then HTC One.What I look in a mobile phone is:1. Great battery life2. Good screen3. Uncluttered software1. Battery life on the MAXX is hands down unparalleled - no other phone has anything close. Objectively or subjectively - any way you look at it. Period.2. 720p AMOLED is perfect! I came from 1080 IPS (HTC DNA) and MAXXs screen is just more comfortable to look at. Love the colors of AMOLED. I live in FL where it's always sunny and I have absolutely no issues with viewing the phone under direct sun light. 5" screen is perfect for me - big enough for browsing and reading and comfortable for my hands. I understand that for smaller hands 5" might be a bit too big to hold and operate.3. I freaking cant stand laggy TouchWiz or convoluted Sense - pure Andorid is just fine, why cover it? The smoothness of the MAXX is just so fluid - never a lag. Motorola, finally, dropped the dreaded MotoBlur and MAXX comes as close to pure Nexus experience as possible. Motorola added a few features but they are really that - features - not gimmicky TouchWiz array of things that most people never use.Few more things. This phone has no LED notification but instead Motorola implemented Active Notifications which display notification on the screen - I find that feature much more useful and convenient than simple LED. Always listening Google Now is more convenient that I initially thought and I find myself using it a few times a day. The camera was updated and now takes really good pictures.Plus, 32 GB storage. Yeah, baby.The only slight drawback for me is that software updates will, as always, screwed up by Verizon, but I'm not sure I want any updates - it is perfect, at least for me.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00E9W8Q1A" id="B00E9W8Q1A-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-31:</strong> No, it's not the fastest.  Not it's not the prettiest.  What it IS, is the the best d***** phone you can buy.  It doesn't really need a case so you can hold the thing - the rubberized coating sees to that.  The screen is nice, bright and sharp.  The sound is amazing, but of course it is - this is a Motorola.  Size is good.  Shape is comfortable.  Radios are superb..  The battery will not die on you after a day.  It runs every game I throw at it.  It's an understated, classy, powerful hand computer/phone/communicator for those of us who are not kids and who need something that is GOING to work and work well, every time you pick it up - even after a hard days use.  Buy it.  The others may have flashy specs or gimmick apps, but this is the best phone you can buy.  Yes, I have tried them and I am in the process of returning an M8 and keeping this.

I would only stop in to check it out in person. Then... it just happened. If you're like me and coming from a Samsung Galaxy Nexus, I'm betting this latest batch from Motorola caught your eye, too. I fully intended to wait for the first reviews, maybe check out the oversized Note III and HTC One Max, and see what LG was bringing to the table, but.../// The Maxx's oversized battery is only part of the attraction. My Nexus had become fickle -- I weeded out a few apps that were absolute battery hogs on that device. While I didn't expect the full two day battery life promised by Verizon, the Maxx had to be at least 2x better than the Gnex, based alone on double battery capacity. But better! After my first 100% charge, I ended my day at 7% after 16 hours off the charger, heavy "first day with a new phone" usage, 1.5 hours video, 1+ hours audio streaming, 45 minutes unplugged Nav, forum browsing & posting, futzing with apps, editing this review, Bluetooth headset use, switching between wifi and 4G about 50/50, lots of screen on time, etc. I've since repeated this with up to 23 hour days, 5-8 hours screen time, video & nav, completely off the charger. I've bumped my screen timeout to 5 minutes, and don't bother switching off WiFi or GPS. And if that's not epic enough (for me, it is), there's a "Battery Saver" slider on the settings menu -- I haven't bothered to flick that On to see what it affects. [edit 7/14 Bbattery life is much reduced; I get about a full day without plugging in, and routinely charge it when using Waze or Nav. To be fair to the phone, I'd have to nuke all apps and restore to like new condition to evaluate, because I have lots of tasks on in the background. And naturally, batteries lose capacity with use, and as they are subjected to never ending charge/discharge cycles.]Amazingly, the extra battery doesn't come at the expense of size. Held back to back, side to side, end to end, these two phones are close to identical in size. You can get the numbers from the spec sheet, but the Maxx is about 3-4 millimeters taller and wider than the Gnex, and more or less identical in thickness. According to my straight edge, the Maxx's screen even has a slight curve to it, ala the overly-hyped curved glass of the Galaxy Nexus.But it's definitely shaped differently. I ran my Gnex without a case for the past year, and I'm starting out caseless with the Maxx. I don't see it visually, but the Maxx has a "wedge" feel to it, where the top end of the phone is thicker, and it slims down towards the bottom. The top end is also heavier. What this means is that, when I'm holding it in one hand, most of that weight is concentrated on my index finger. I'd prefer it the other way around -- with that weight and thickness at the bottom -- where it's resting more on two fingers. I know, I know... we're only talking about 164g according to my scale, but the phone feels more comfortable and balanced when I hold it flipped around like that. Despite the very similar size to my old phone, the Maxx has a definite chunky feel to it, not UNcomfortable, but -less- comfortable than my previous phone.+++ My wife slipped a Diztronic TPU case onto her Maxx, and despite its slim dimensions, the phone feels bulky and unpocketable. My recommendation is to skip the case if you can.+++ If you need a quality holster for this phone and want to run caseless, and don't mind an easy do-it-yourself mod, check my review for this Sedio spring clip unit:Seidio HLSSG4AASAThe phone's back is interesting. It's not the shiny, hard plasticky finish of the Droid Ultra. Instead, it's a very lightly textured ("rubberized") but smooth finish, with the appearance of a fiber weave. This finish wraps around the bottom edges of the phone and even around the chin to the face, down by the mic. The bottom corners are all rounded, so they're somewhat comfortable -- not squared off, though not as rounded as the Galaxy Nexus. The back is smooth enough that it -does- gets smudged with fingerprints, but matte enough that they're not easily noticeable. The Verizon and Droid labels are modestly sized, and rather than bright white, are of a dark gray hue that is easy to ignore.All together it creates a package with a hefty, high-quality feel. I never minded the durable all-plastic construction of my Nexus and Samsung's Galaxy lineup -- something many reviewers and forum posters dismiss as "cheap." But the Maxx feels anything but, possibly belied by its flat slab appearance.Interrupting the smooth Kevlar wrap are the power and volume buttons -- all stacked on the right side -- that project from the device perhaps a little more than necessary, and with very square edges and textured surfaces. The buttons don't really jive with the carefully crafted, smooth-to-the-touch backside finish, but then again, there's no mistaking when my fingers are resting on them -- even lightly -- so hopefully no accidental presses./// Boot is about 1 minute 15 seconds to home screen/slide-to-unlock, but 2:25 until I get a PIN pad unlock (time in between, apps still loading and processes running) [post KitKat 4.4.4 update; original boot time was 30 seconds, which increased to 45 seconds with 12.15.15, then 55s w/ 4.4]. That's still pretty quick to phones I've owned previously, but nearly double the stock, Day 1 boot time. The busy (and noisy) Droid boot animation, followed by the default red home screen, put me off at first -- it all just feels very "angry" -- but as I'm sure you're aware, that's all easily changeable with a good selection of included live and static wallpapers (a soothing blue relaxed the feel of the phone for me; I wonder if the default aggressive red tone -- VZW's Droid branding -- turns off would be buyers at the in-store display).While looking for my next phone, I've been really intrigued by the front-firing speaker on the HTC One. My previous phone (like practically every other phone) was rear-firing, but with speaker placement at the bottom of the phone, where my hand tended to cup it and muffle the volume. Not to mention it was a pretty weak speaker. The Maxx? Surprisingly good, by comparison. The speaker is at the top of the phone, co-located with the camera. It's loud. Even when facing into my passenger seat, the Google Nav directions come through crisply. I've tried to muffle the sound with my hand, like for instance when holding the phone in landscape mode to watch a video, and it comes through loud and clear. The sound is still projecting to the rear, which means the phone is projecting away from me and toward the rest of the room that I'm facing, but it's so much improved over the Gnex that I'm now only partially envious of the HTC speaker.I recall quite a bit of forum debate over the 3.5mm audio jack placement on the Nexus -- some folks absolutely HATE the bottom placement (I, for one, was a fan). The Maxx puts that jack up on the top of the phone, where many users think is its rightful place. I suppose I'm indifferent since I tend to use bluetooth headphones when I'm out. But at home, laying in bed and catching up on some YouTube while plugged in to my charger, I've now got to contend with cords coming out of both sides of my phone.One other design niggle -- wnen using the phone on a flat surface, screen presses anywhere within a half inch of the edges causes the phone to rock. The back runs flat for a few inches from top to bottom (down the spine), but is curved side to side all the way across.Let's talk about the Super AMOLED (RGB) screen. The quality is great. Really, I'm don't feel deprived without 1080p. But, don't hate me for this, I preferred some aspects of the Galaxy Nexus Pentile (non-RGB) AMOLED better. Here's what I'm noticing with the Maxx:- whites look slightly gray, particularly in a dark room- blacks have sort of a reddish tinge to them, particularly in dark- in general, pictures look underexposed (for instance when browsing a news website)- in video playback, the black and darker areas of the screen have better overall consistency than on my Gnex (less noise)- in bright sunlight, the screen brightness can't meet the challenge (so what's new?)- but in dark rooms, it's almost as though the screen can't dim enough (but just slightly so)- the active notifications appearing on the screen aren't ever-present -- the phone needs to be jostled / disturbed for the blank screen to briefly light up and display the current notifications, BUT the phone does not need to be flipped over to activate this (a light tapping of the face-up phone causes the Active Display to light up)- >> the capacitive buttons now dim during most video playback [as up 12.15.15 update] -- nice; they were originally full bright, which was distracting in a dark setting.- there's just the slightest amount of light leak from between the screen and capacitive buttons, over the Back button -- but only noticeable in a dark room- the Maxx pixels per inch (PPI) display density works out to 296 PPI across the 5" screen. The Gnex screen was slightly smaller (4.7" -- less if you consider on-screen buttons took up some of that space), so despite it being the same resolution, would have been 316 PPI -- except for its shared-pixel Pentile display. I've seen the case made that the Pentile display dropped the effective PPI down to the 200 range. I can't say I ever took issue with that screen by Samsung, but I could see jaggies on certain websites, and those just aren't present on the Maxx -- this display, overall, appears sharper.There's going to be an adjustment period for me, no doubt, but despite some of the negatives I've listed, I don't consider any of these to be deal breakers.I mentioned the capacitive buttons. Versus the on-screen buttons found on the Moto X and Gnex, these ones are ever-present. Accessing Google Now takes a slightly paused press of the home button before swiping up, vs. the simple swipe motion (no hold) of an on-screen home button. And some older apps still call up the 3-dot menu button which takes up a whole 'nother row (a black "menu bar" across the entire bottom of the display). On phones with the virtual buttons on-screen, the main three (Back, Home, and Task) would simply make room for the skinny 3-dot -- making it all the more obscene that when it appears on the Maxx, it takes up its own row. To get around that, I can go into Settings and enable a "long press of task switcher" option. That gets rid of the wasted screen, but now I have to remember which apps use this long press to access the menu (and some apps only do this on certain screens). This should be less and less of a problem as developers update their apps, as I believe the standard for the OS v4.0 and higher is to display the menu ellipses at the top right corner of the application.+++ Speaking of OS, my phone came with Jelly Bean 4.2.2, but units shipping now ought to have KitKat 4.4 installed (or otherwise readily downloadable via an easily access "Check For Updates" selection in the Settings > About Phone > System Updates menu). If you're coming from a Gnex, KitKat is basically the same, only snappier. If you're coming from Ice Cream Sandwich or Gingerbread, I guarantee you'll be impressed with the smoothness and overall look/feel of this operating system.I'm still setting up my various apps and checking them for compatibility. I'm not going to attempt to generate a comprehensive list of what does / doesn't work, but here are some quick notes:- /// As of the 4.4.4 update, on-againg/off-again FoxFi is no longer compatible for WiFi tethering. You'll have to resort to USB tethering instead.- >>> As of 11/12/13, FoxFi is compatible for tethering. It *requires* a PIN-enabled lock screen (not pattern) due to some VPN nonsense that I admittedly don't completely understand (FoxFi was great on the Galaxy Nexus, and didn't require this)- +++ Google Wallet tap-to-pay IS supported with as of the KitKat OS -- an app I've been running on the Gnex since about week one.  Cruel irony, my purchase of the Maxx was my last Google Wallet NFC transaction before the KitKat update (Verizon clerk: "Oh, I've never seen THAT before!" as I swiped my Nexus across her payment terminal)- YouTube updated me to version 5.0, which I was not yet able to access on the Play Store from my Gnex or my TF700T tablet- Swype keyboard is working A-Ok, and pops up nearly instantly when called- +++ Nova Launcher is working A-Ok; mic icon in "persistent search bar" (shortcut to Google Now) calls up the voice recognition screen nearly instantly; [new KitKat option for transparent notification bar works as demonstrated on Nexus KitKat devices]- Sound Profile app by Corcanoe is A-Ok without any of the problems / workarounds experienced by Galaxy S4 users- The stock Android dialer app has been enhanced to allow dialing by first or last name, or partial phone number -- nothing new for users of skinned versions of Android (Touchwiz, Sense, Motoblur) or other OSs, but a feature requiring an aftermarket app for stock Nexus users; alas, no updated 4.4.4 dialer as seen on Nexus devices- +++ "OK Google Now" is quick, responsive, and  pretty awesome... but less so with a lock screen [New with KitKat: with user permission, the phone allows certain voice commands to process even if the phone is locked; actions requiring an unlock allow the user to speak the PIN code]- "Set alarm for ten a.m." used to take me directly to the stock clock app, even though I had alternate alarm applications installed. No longer; I'm now given the option to default to whichever one I choose (tested with Timely and Alarm Clock Xtreme); no such luck with "set timer for three minutes", which still just sets an alarm for whatever time is closest to 3 minutes from now- As expected, logging in with my Google credentials automatically downloaded all my apps and contacts, with the exception, oddly enough, of Facebook- Not exactly an app, but the brightness slider from the main pull-down menu is very picky, doesn't like switching back to "Auto," and times out quickly -- but works fine from Power Control widget- +++ There's a bug in the task switcher where not all open apps appear -- including the app I'm currently using (this originally was the same with the Gnex, but was changed in a recent OS update). [This seems to have been partially resolved with KitKat -- it still happens, but less frequently.]- +++ [Settings > Apps now has a dedicated "Disabled Apps" view to allow me to see all the unwanted Verizon pre-installed goodies I've exiled from my app drawer. They used to appear at the bottom of the lists.]- /// I've been using the LEEF microSD card reader for added storage; with 4.4.4 USB OTG means this reader is natively supported (using your preferred file manager such as Astro)+++ The Camera [post 12.15.15 update & post KitKat observations]: I'm now super happy with the camera. Images were always as sharp as can be expected from a cell phone, with good, natural colors. There's no longer a problem with highly contrasted scenes (original firmware couldn't handle bright backlighting, such as under a canopy of trees with a bright sky in the background). I'll continue to rely on my compact camera outfitted with anEye-Fi Mobiwhen I'm looking for best clarity and dynamic range, but the Maxx's results are definitely suitable for everyday, in-the-moment type shots. Under KitKat, Tap-To-Focus has been replaced with "Drag-To-Focus:" drag the focal bracket anywhere on the screen to set the focal point and exposure; tapping anywhere on the screen releases the shutter. Holding my finger press captures a multiple exposures at a rate of one frame per second (and displays a convenient counter), great for automatic GIF animation by the magic behind Google Plus (which I have set up to auto-upload my pics). The updated camera UI moves the mode dial to a large arc along the left edge, and utilizes that nifty "twist yer wrist" technique to pop directly into camera mode from sleep, like the Moto X (and no unlock PIN required). There's also a half-decent slo-mo video mode, which is fun for well-lit scenes of fast moving objects, or just a honey bee landing on a flower. The HDR mode is incrementally improved with OS 4.4 -- still not on par with true 3-frame HDR post-processing, but an acceptable substitute for scenes where compromised lighting would otherwise challenge these rinky-dink sensors. As of the 12.15.15 update, the camera software now appears to be updated as an app in Google Play, which ought to mean no more delays waiting for Verizon to vet the software via their "slowest in the biz" OS update process.The flash is dimmer and yellower than what I've become accustom to on my Nexus, but this is only evident when I'm using it as a flashlight. In flash-filled photos, the camera's white balance is adjusted appropriately for the non-exactly-white LED, and as long as my expectations aren't too high (i.e. subjects are within 6-10 feet of the camera and I'm not trying to light a whole room), the photos seem to be adequately focused, and in a matter of only a second or two. But don't expect you're going to freeze any poorly-lighted motion with this shooter, and expect to see a good amount of noise at full rez. This isn't a Nokia, after all!The operating system is pretty dang close to stock Android. Motorola threw some extras in there for the camera and photo sharing, plus a widget or two, and of course there's a whole bevy of Verizon bloat including NFL, MyVZW, visual voicemail, VZW nav, etc... even a caller ID service that sneakily activates, then tries to enroll the user for monthly billing. But with 32 gigs of memory on board, a little attention paid, and the ability to quarantine these apps, they're hardly a bother. The phone's interface is pure Google.In that list of apps up above, I pointedly mention the delay-free call-ups of the Swype keyboard and the Google Now microphone icon. Launching these actions had been increasingly bogged down on my Nexus, I believe due to memory management issues. Androids TRIM memory management in Android 4.4 should prevent that on this phone.+++ The "OK Google Now" voice wake (well, really, it works when the phone is already awake, too) is shaping up to be more than a gimmick. After an initial "voice training" session in a quiet place, I OK Google Now'd my phone where it sat on the passenger seat cushion. "Navigate to work" (work already being defined in my Google Now account) and, bingo, I'm hearing Google's familiar, clear directions. Same with text messages to my wife, and setting an alarm. One step closer to hands free. With KitKat, many actions such as Navigation or alarm settings can be voice-initiated without entering a PIN or Pattern unlock. If I dictate a text to my wife, after voice-composing the message and verifying the recipient, the Maxx will prompt "Say or type PIN code" before sending, for a true hands free interaction!+++ Although regarding pin/pattern unlock, the Maxx offers up a cool option (excuse me if this is old news -- new to me) to recognize trusted Bluetooth devices, and gives the option to leave the phone unlocked as long as it remains in range. Think car, smartwatch, a generic USB dongle in a home or office PC, etc. -- the phone will only lock down when it "walks away" out of signal range of one of these trusted Bluetooth devices. [However, I've deactivated this built-in feature for a paid app called SkipLock, which does the same, but with WiFi, too, and it works extremely well.]Oh... face unlock makes a reappearance, too. I actually used that a bit on the Gnex.I can't post this review without mentioning the all-important connectivity. The radios are great -- both 4G & wifi.- In my basement, where I've struggled to pull a 3G signal on the Gnex, I maintained a 4G connection on the Maxx, which allowed me to download apps (initial phone setup) while watching an HD video on YouTube- On the main floor of the house, where my signal would flip between 3G and 4G on the Gnex, the Maxx operates decidedly in 4G territory- At work, one room in the office far removed from the wifi antenna would consistently go to zero bars (yet, frustratingly, not lose it completely and therefore would not switch over to the strong 4G signal), I now have at least one wifi bar accompanied by a usable flow of data- Overall, switching between wifi and 4G on the margins seems improved vs. what I had before, though even with "ignore weak wifi connections" checked, the Maxx at times seems indecisive about switching from one to the other. If I have one wifi bar that's trickling data, and a 3-bar 4G signal available, the choice should be obvious- No problem with Bluetooth connections; I'm stoked that I now have full integration with my Ford's Sync system, with artist/track tagging from Pandora, and read-out-loud messaging with canned replies- Voice call quality overall is excellent. This is one of Motorola's strong suits, I hear. I'm impressed.Do you remember the iPhone 4's "death grip" problem? It seems that in marginal 4G areas (like that signal-quashing basement I mentioned), turning the Droid Maxx to landscape mode and holding it with both hands causes it to show a drop of 5 to 10 dBm off the signal strength meter (Settings > More > Mobile Networks > Network Type and Strength). If I'm already in the (low strength) -115 to -120 range, this results in me completely losing 3G and 4G connectivity. Releasing one hand brings the signal back to life. Where my 4G signal is strong, the signal drop is there, but my connection remains intact.I've taken GPS accuracy for granted for a few years, so I was surprised to notice the Maxx's sense of direction may be slightly off. I use Google Nav frequently, and on a couple of occasions, the Maxx seemed to think I strayed off course onto the streets vs. getting on the freeway on-ramp, or exited when I really stayed on the highway, and as such gives me a fast re-route and impossible directions. It (well, Google Nav) then quickly corrects itself. I'd chock this up to accepted errors in compacted urban driving environments, except that the Gnex, previous Garmin devices, and Ford GPS simply don't exhibit this behavior. It would only be a problem if I already screwed up and missed a turn, but this nevertheless results in confusing instructions. Though other than those relatively minor blips, location setting is fast and mostly accurate, even in many indoor settings.Another point to mention: Heat. My Galaxy Nexus often ran hot. When it did, I knew it was busy with something that was burning through the battery. This phone has run even hotter, both times in the car plugged in. The first was just downloading apps, the second was also running Nav with the screen on the whole time. But I've yet to see it run this hot outside of the car, and in fact, in the car running Nav but not plugged in, and not downloading apps, is was perfectly cool (and only lost 4% of the charge over about 20 minutes of Nav + screen-on time). So I'm guessing the heat comes from the 4G radio and processor working overtime switching cell sites, transferring data, and unpacking / installing applications, though again, this isn't the case when it's doing those same tasks sitting still in the house (and on 4G).Check back. I'm sure I'll have some more detail to add to this already too-long review as I get to know this phone, particularly with respect to battery life, application compatibility problems & successes, and more observations on the radio switching & possible "death grip" issue.But in summary, I'm sticking with my title -- this phone may have some issues here and there, and it may not be the fastest/biggest/most beautiful/polished specimen out there this late summer and fall, but in my opinion it's the first suitable contender to supersede the Samsung Galaxy Nexus, and betters that phone in a number of key areas. I have a great deal of confidence in Motorola at this time -- both in their tie to Google, and their strong affiliation with VZW. Thankfully, if you're tied to Verizon, you've suddenly got a few good choices after a long drought./// The 4.4.4 update continues with minor "polishing" and not much in the way of big features -- some supposed camera improvements, some slight bug fixes, and couple of minor UI tweaks, and the switchover to the ART runtime -- which I'm seeing is resulting in a couple of apps not running, but should result in snappier performance for those that have addressed this. What I'm not seeing yet? Device mirroring Chromcasting (none of the Droids are on the compatibility list), and an upgrade path to Android L (again, not on any lists I've seen). This continues to be a good phone, and a good buy at a discounted price. We're at that point where the device is stable and mature, but there are new options on the horizon, so although my rating stands, it's probably time to look at newer or up-and-coming phones.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00E9W8Q1A" id="B00E9W8Q1A-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-15:</strong> This phone is way better than some of the other reviews make it out to be. I was between this and the LG-G2... and I am so happy I chose the Droid Maxx.1) Battery: I am a moderate smartphone user. I work in a hospital where I get calls/texts/pages on my phone. I text, call, use e-mail, calendar, do quick searches on medical apps, and listen to Pandora in my car. When I unplugged my phone the first morning, I had 85% at the end of the first day, left it unplugged overnight, 50% at the end of the second day, unplugged overnight again, and ended up with 25% around 2:00 at which time I plugged it in. The battery really does stand out in this phone.2) Reception is great. 4G LTE all around the hospital, and even still good 3G reception in the basement. No complaints.3) Stock Android 4.2.2 with VERY minimal Verizon bloatware, and the Motorola specific features are mild, and even useful. The Chrome texting extension is nice to respond to text messages while I sit at the computer.4) Snappy, snappy, snappy. I had an HTC EVO 4G LTE (Sprint version of HTC One X) that had a 1.5 dual core, and the Droid Maxx's 1.7 dual core (X8, whatever) processor really holds up much better. Google Maps/Navigation snaps right up on screen, finds the address. Browsing is quick. Switching tasks is seamless. Pandora starts right up with no wait or lag when selecting options.5) Unlocked. You can use this phone with a SIM card you buy abroad. Or with an AT&T; SIM, whatever. Travel a lot? Get this phone.6) Nice screen. The screen is the typical over-saturated AMOLED screen, but honestly it was strange to me for about 5 minutes. I'm used to the colors, and actually prefer them. The HTC had a more "natural" Super LCD screen, but it's NOT a factor in my opinion.7) The AMOLED screen allows for "Active Notifications" which is actually a really nice add-on to this phone. Basically, the phone senses when it is taken out of a pocked, picked up off a table, shifted to be used... then it pops up the time and any notifications onto the screen with minimal battery use. You can then delete the notification, or open it up right then and there. Sounds silly, but it's a really nice, elegant feature. The screen is pretty close to "edge-to-edge", though not like the LG-G2... but it's really not that big of a difference. Difference between 720p and 1080p is SO hard to see on a screen this small, that I'm surprized people actually care. Less pixels=less strain on the GPU/CPU, lower battery consumption. I don't need super-high def to read an e-mail, high def is overkill anyway. Period.8) Solid build quality. The back of the phone "probably" isn't Kevlar, but the soft-touch/rubberized backing is really, really nice. So much so, that I have decided not to get a case for the phone since it looks so nice, and doesn't attract fingerprints. The backing is very similar to the TPU cases you buy here anyway. The phone has got some solid heft to it, but I like that.9) Camera is ok. There are probably better cell phone cameras, but I don't take a ton of pictures on my phone. It's really good enough for those times when I find something funny to show my friends... you know, once a month MAYBE. I wouldn't say it's bad, I'd just say it fine. Similar to the HTC One X.Well, that's it. I'd highly recommend it. Actually, I already did... to my co-workers. They're impressed, as was I. I'll keep you posted on anything that changes, but I'm sticking to it that this is a great phone.UPDATE:Had this phone for about two months now, and it has only gotten better.1) Touchless Control: I tried out the "touchless control" and it works really quite well (note: the phone has to get to know your voice, so if you have voice texted on an Android in the past, chances are the phone knows your voice well because it connects to Google, which learns your voice. If this is your first Android, it'll take about 10-20 commands for it to get good.) I am able to do a lot without touching the phone. HUGE NOTE: it will suck battery much quicker. I still can get two days, but it won't go into the second night and into the third day like it does with touchless control off. Hence, I keep it off.2) Very stock Android. I mean really, none of that Touchwiz/Sense stuff going on here (although, Sense is pretty nice) but I will say, I really like the stock, snappy feel of this operating system. The nice thing is that with Touchwiz/Sense, some RAM is used up since it's basically a "skin" on stock android, here, you don't have that. Nice.3) Battery. Still a big wow factor. Unplug my phone Friday morning, drive out to my friend's cabin up north Wisconsin... forgot my charger. Phone lasted till I got back Sunday night without going into the Red (granted I didn't use it much since I was having fun up north). Really useful when your group splits up at the bars late on a Saturday night, and you are confident your phone still has battery to call them. Way up in the sticks. Nice.4) I got the Skinomi screen cover and it's really nice. The material doesn't attract fingerprints, and lets my finger glide on it (not stick to it like the glass screen). It isn't glass smooth, more orange-peely, but it's still SUPER clear. And, REALLY easy to make it perfect. No bubbles, perfect fit. (it's a wet application protector, so once it's on the phone, it can be re-positioned for a couple minutes as it dries so you get the perfect placement)5) Like I said, I haven't gotten a case for it, and there are still no scratches to the back of the phone. Like mentioned, it's a rubberized backing material that honestly feels like a TPU case itself. I still don't think this phone needs the case, and I'm going to stick to that. (if you drop your phone a lot, that might be a different story, but I don't)CONS: Not many at all, really. It's a really, really nice phone. This is what smartphones have been aiming for all along. Nice screen, battery, feel, reception, storage, etc... The only things:- Home screen does't wrap around (so what, right? It doesn't bother me, but there you go)- Running Applications button sometimes needs two attempts to get it to work. Maybe my fingers are too fat, who knows.- Contacts' pictures don't sync with Facebook like they did on my HTC... really missed that, so I found an app that works REALLY well: HaxSync ($4, I think). Now all my contacts have HD quality pictures uploaded straight from Facebook.- When connected to Bluetooth, it plays at full volume through my car stereo. That's good, but when I go to change the phone volume up/down, it gets quieter. It's hard to explain. Basically, I just have to use the car stereo to regulate the volume (duh, that's fine) not the phone. There is a setting that popped up the FIRST time I connected the bluetooth, and I just quick hit 'Accept' without reading it... that was probably the problem. Just FYI.That's it! I really recommend this phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00E9W8Q1A" id="B00E9W8Q1A-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-19:</strong> Wow, I have been using my Droid Maxx for a week and I am impressed! The handset is a bit on the heavy side, but you get used to it. Very solid build quality, outstanding battery life, amazing screen, and the OS is very impressive. Motorola has tweaked the Android 4.4 OS just enough to make it even smarter than expected. The push notifications, speech recognition, and on board assist are a welcome addition. The phone feels quick and responsive. Call quality is great and wow, did I mention the battery life! Side Note: AT&T users should also be advised that your nano sim WILL in fact work out of the box.

I have to say, this has been the most dramatic upgrade since I switch to my first smartphone (Droid Eris) - particularly from a usability standpoint. I loved my GN because it had a ton of great features and offered a clean / stock user experience - it was a very functional phone. I hated my GN because it was sooo power hungry and because it was more and more buggy over time. The Maxx is an upgrade in every sense - except I do miss some of the formatting changes in Android 4.3 that are not in the Maxx. I think the improvements, both in terms of hardware and Moto Droid software, are dramatically enough to over come this one minus.Pros:> Battery! Wow, can't say enough good things about the battery. I am a mid-to-high power user, my GN was lasting about 4-6 hours per charge before. So I had chargers everywhere, a back-up external battery (2 full charge capacity), and extra battery. Some travel days I would go through the entire battery, the back-up and the second back-up charge. It was extremely frustrating. I can make it through two typical days now. Not quite 48 hours (average), maybe 40 hours. That said, I have gone almost three days on low use days. Overnight I loose about 6% battery life this is about 1% battery loss per hour in idle. I am not using any third party power save apps or features. 4G/Wifi always on.> Love the shape/feel. I do not feel like this phone is larger/heavier than the GN. Build quality is much improved.> Snappy performance - very satisfied with the memory/processor and software> Screen is a great upgrade from 4.65" pentile to 5" RGB. Also, I find the screen brightness much better - I typically only have to go to 60-80% when outdoors, vs. still not being able to see the screen at 100% with the GN. I don't feel like I am missing anything in not having a 1080p screen - I tested this phone along with several 1080p phones at Verizon for weeks before selecting the Maxx - I never really saw a difference on these smaller screens. Sure, a TV is one thing, 5" screen, not so much.> I love the ActiveDisplay - although you do have to get used to not pressing the screen.> Voice Activation: "Ok Google Now" works to launch the Google Now search feature. This is a handy feature at times, but honestly, I thought I would use this much more than I do. The issue is the lock screen - it gets in the way of using the feature. You say "Ok Google Now" but you have to still swipe to unlock before you can get the information. Notably, you do not have to pause your question - the phone does remember you command even it it can not unlock to provide the result.> Camera is a huge improvement to the GN. Camera comparisons to some of the other smartphone has not shown the Moto phones to excel at image quality, but I do have to say in terms of improvement from where I was - this is fantastic. I particularly like the double twist camerra launch. Next to ActiveDisplay this is probably my most used new software feature. Notably, you do not have to unlock to use the camera, but you do have to unlock for any editing or to review past pictures.> Radio signals seem to be at the same, if not better level than the GN. I feel like the WiFi might be a bit better. Call quality is much improved, particular on the loudness aspect. Also, I have not noticed the Maxx to run as hot as the GN. I used to have an issue holding the GN if the screen was on too long or a call ran long - this is not an issue anymore.Cons:> Active Display does not work well manually when in the car. My car does not have a clock that illuminates - so it would have been nice to be able to nudge the phone to get the time, but do to the car vibrations the active display does not seem to work. I still get notifications for text and email while driving though - so I do not think it is deactivated. Also, in order to use MotoAssist for "Driving" mode you have to enabel GPS (and I do not).> Captive buttons: These are the ever present (but still touch screen) buttons on the bottom of the phone. Android has been moving away from these for years and the GN did not have them. I have to say I preferred not having the buttons, but it is not an issue launching Google Now by any means, especially since you can just say "Ok Google Now".</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00E9W8Q1A" id="B00E9W8Q1A-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-09:</strong> Had these phones for a little while now and they are impressive with most of their features and abilities.

First was the venerable "Razr V3xx" back in the days of flipphones, it acquired a cult-like status with even some famous Bollywood actor insisting to be photographed with a Moto Razr, always.Then there was Moto "Atrix4G" sharing the status of a Flagship Android device worldwide - with Samsung Galaxy (Atrix2 was a slight step backwards video & battery-wise, though), now come Droid MAXX - PEOPLE CLAIMING iPhone is the one to have, aren't using their brains, those are little girls, teenagers or very old folks, not powerusers, not deeply technical people, should I call things by their names and say it bluntly - people still fixated on iC*** are either average intelligence or refuse to apply their brains when analyzing technical specs.  EVEN appearance/materials, not being anywhere as important as technical functions, in Moto's are now a match and exceed iPhones, and surely Samsung's cheap plasticky bodies.  This is Kevlar and a formfactor I suspect inspired by my review of an Atrix4G abput 3 years ago (?) read by Moto engineers, where I proposed to revive the cult classic "Razzr" formfactor, so it was born anew in Droid Razr and now newest - DROD MAXX.It is perhaps a bunch of words above, with no concrete Tech Specs to illustrate the point this "Moto DroidMAXX" is the top of SmartPhones today, beating iPhone into the dust and exceeding Samsung Galaxy likewise - at least for functions I need, but Iam buzy these days - used to write profusely long technical reviews, but not today.  So today I just say one example (below) of why DroidMAXX is really "MAX", and end the review:Motorola is not a marketing or showbiz company, like Apple had tendency tobe, remember Steve Jobs was a great marketeer, but not an engineer/not true inventor - he had partnered with Steve Wozniak for technical side of their company several decades ago basically iPhones look good, appeal to girls, managed to penetrate markets, talking heads but they don't design ICchips inside their devices!, they doNOt design circuits, they design a selling machine.Whereas Motorola was born as an Electronics company (first to fill the need for the early car radios, hence name Moto (cars) Rola (riding)), they went on to become one of the dozen major world's suppliers of Semiconductor IC's (chips).  they design/manufacture THOSE ELECTRONIC CHIPS inside their stuff, so when I was on a rmeote island somehwere in the Pacific, I happened to have two excellent phones, one Moto & another equally $pricey.  I reached my parents on Motorola, could not get thru on the other phone!Point is, Motorola makes electronics, RF/frontend circuits inside these phonese, the company know this stuff by it being their primary business.  Whereas Apple, depends in somebody else's electronics, they were manufacturing for a long time in south China, it's fueled by the hype & marketing.Tobe fair, iPhone is indeed in top 5 devices worlwide, fine, but people - use your brains when you want the "BEST HARDWARE" + "OPEN OPERATING SYSTEM": it's either Moto or Samsung and OS - Android.A simple task of moving a file from computer to SmartPhone (e.g. a drawing/design in my case), editing & presentation to customers half-world away, then moving file back to a computer - is a painful multistep on iPhone, some people with their iPhones end up emailing files to themselves which is like swimming in tuxedo - not efficient.  Because iOS is a closed "Holy Warden" garden, whereas Android does not assume users are stupid and allows you be in control, it is easier to infect but hey, if you're afraid of the wolves, don't go to the forest - "sit at home" with iOS, get fat.Not to mention, Google now owns "MotoMobility" (i.e. has money to further R&D; Research) and a state-of-the-art battery in DroidMAXX is ummatched (in its size/weight) - I vote to claim it "Best of the world", best device one can get for under $700 based on contract-less (true) cost.Maybe someone makes $2000 SmartPhones powered by Hydrogen fuelcells and dual-side displays, I don't know :), for the rest of us - DroidMAXX seems to have done what Razzr did many years ago, i.e. quietly become "best", yet hordes of people will coontinue to cling to their inferior iPhones - because Apple is good with marketing (akin to VHS videotapes decades ago, having won market over a technically-superior BetaMax tape, because Beta Consortium wasn't as good in marketing despite ironically offering a better product (BetaMax ended up in high-end/professional market, but lost mass/consumer market where most money was made by VHS).  This is what iPhone did initially - it is the modern era "VHS" able to convince we need inferior devices because they're made by Holy Apple, but it seems Anroids are increasingly outselling iOS at least in overseas markets & volume-wise, if not in $profitability where Apple still reigns.As of Moto DroidMAXX vs. Samsung Galaxies - battery & build quality of the DroidMAXX alone & usability issues with Samsung, made me choose one Adroid (MAXX) over the other (Galaxy) and then confirmed by in person/store visit that MAXX is indeed "Max" (better), Samsung has done much to propel Android to its high position today, but I think DroidMAXX this year takes the spotlight (+ Apple being entangled into patents litigations vs. Samsung, is an ongoing struggle with outcome to be seen [could be banned from certain sales in the U.S.])Think:We need mobile phones first to make calls/TALK, only secondly to make lame pictures or waste time on inane games, if a half-$Thousand dollar device fails to pick up a remote, ultra-weak signal as happens with iPhones (they're not good in RF/signal processing), why do I need it ?!, I always felt that Motorola's RFfrontend electronics is better due to being able to establish a call in noise, exceedingly weak signal scenario, where LG, HTC, and yes - that overhyped iPhone, fail and drop calls.If I had no life, no work/career, & wanted a toy - it's better to get a Tablet, than iPhone anyway, if my life depends on a phone call - it's better to get a device whose primary target is that - good signal processing, voice calls, which Motorolas been good at for decades (more or less, they did release afew awful products in the past, amongst excellent ones like Razr V3xx)Maxx is not even "fatter" much and not heavier than Samsung, but battery in MAXX is a piece of art, it runs unusually long time (at least if you have a brain to edit stock settings into optimal mode conserving battery).I should be fair however, and menton "Apple Corp." started it all, so while iPhone is inferior & at least not my preference, and while iOS is officially dethroned by Androids in terms of worlwide sales (if not $profitability) - at least I admit if it wasn't for Apple, we maynot have had great Androids today.But that was past.  Today you should get an Android, & I vote for Moto DroidMAXX, or DroidULTRA (slightly saller/lighter, less battery), or on AT&T; - at least get "Moto X", and if you need certain useless features (I don't) yet don't mind shorter batter life & cheaper materials/buld quality - then get Samsung Galaxies, but by all means not an iPhone if your goal is to get WORK DONE (be PRODUCTIVE), not play games or childish animations.===========================No spell check - buzy, night (dark), mobile device (tiny keyboard), typed on DroidMAXX (mom's got months ago, I am waiting for own, in shipment from Amazon).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00E9W8Q1A" id="B00E9W8Q1A-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-23:</strong> Hi I just brought the Droid Maxx from another retailer.  I would have brought it from Amazon but there was a huge special on this from another sight. Anyway even with that I do buy a ton of stuff from Amazon and have the highest respect for them and there customer service so i would highly recommend Amazon.  I just had to do something which involved a eye to eye contact with a seller.From here on in the review was re written.  The first time I wrote the review I was complaining about the sound and the volume was low, and on hearing aid mode it was unclear.  I exchanged the phone and it seems to be much better.  Anyway on with my review.It is true the phone is not "as loud" as the other phones. I loved the phone I was willing to live with it. Yesterday however I went down to Miami Beach  and I was around a lot of noise and I actually had no problem hearing anyone. So this is not a concern anymore. The calls were clear and loud enough for me to easily hear the party on the other ear.  I did exchange a phone a few days ago (same model) which was a bit more unclear and had a bit more bass. I must say with the new phone I'm very happy even if this phone is "not as loud" as other manufactures.I also had another surprise  the Camera.  The Camera is a basic very limited camera that the user cannot adjust to conditions. I've taken pics during the day and night The picture quality is very good both day and night.  The camera noise at night is there but it's really not that bad, and at times not existent at all. In miami last night I was able to take a pic of of an awning from across  the street with low lighting around it and the camera picked  up the writing on the awning and I was able to read every letter.  As a critic I will say this Camera has some of the best automatic functioning I've ever seen. The pictures are of good quality also.  Would I like to manually adjust the camera into iso's and do my own exposure? sure I would but for an automatic adjustment this camera is excellent.  If I'm satisfied it must be great. I have owned the Lumina 928 and Droid DNA I will say  the Lumina had the best Camera the colors were real deep and really clear. and but you couldn't zoom in and out during video. The Droid DNA had a excellent still pics in clarity the color was a little off. But the biggest problem with it was the DNA focused in and out during video.  The Droid Maxx over all has accurate day time colors at night it might turn a a yellow light into a lighter one but other than that I had no issues.  I was able to zoom in and out in video mode and the camera stayed very focus. The colors are accurate maybe not as deep as a Samsung, or the Lumina 928 So my point over all the Camera is great when you combine functionality and quality. Other phones might excel is one area but then you lose it in others. Compared to what I owned I like the balance of the Droid Maxx the best.The Samsung s4 and this phone are Verizon Flagship phones. It is True the Samsung line is a lot more popular.  So Why did I pic Motorola?  I like it better. The battery life is great even after tethering, Games, Miracasting, and a lot of calling. After 15 hours with that kind of usage I still had 30% left.  The Samsung phones fall out of my hands like butter and I'm not much for cases.  The Droid maxx has a much better feel. In the Past I had an s3 and the reception was horrible, I can't speak for the S4.  The samsung in Call volume is much louder than the motorola but the Motorola is a lot clearer.  the Motorola has a great voice command over the Samsung.One thing I am a bit disappointed in  is miracast. DLNA is gone, and so is using an hdmi cable on from the phone to your TV.You can only use this phone with Miracast.  With Miracast anything that is on your phone screen will wirelessly be on the TV screen. it works but it does Lag which means it's not good for games, but like DLNA you can see pictures and now watch videos without having PC network connectivity knowledge.  Samsung has allshare. I've never seen it work but when I was in Best Buy a salesman who worked for samsung was there and he was telling me the Samsung unit (which acts like a miracast unit has no lag at all.) I cannot say if this is accurate or not.  If it is true that would be my only down fall with the moto. My personal opinion Miracast is not ready for primetime and no phone manufacturer should have discontinued the HDMI cable until miracast was better developed with no lag. so the gamers can play. I guess if I wanted to I can still build play Tick Tac Toe, use it for wheel of Fourtune, word find etc. you just can't use it for action games.  (for me stuff like need for speed, Crazy taxi etc.After having this phone for a week I'm very happy with it.  When My screen cracked on my Droid DNA I went cheap and brought a windows Lumia phone from Craigslist. I was so unhappy with the operating system (but I loved the hardware) I went and brought the Moto. I have not looked back ever since.  Is the phone perfect no but it's dam good.  It feels great in the hand, the battery life is awesome, the Camera takes very good pics, the sound quality is good, the voice command system is great to.  and Android beats windows os anytime LOL.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00E9W8Q1A" id="B00E9W8Q1A-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-14:</strong> I love this phone.

They have been fantastic for 11 months until I began to wear them while exercising 3 weeks ago and found that despite their claim of being moisture and sweat resistant they don't appear the be able to handle sweat much at all. My head and neck get damp during exercise (not dripping) and it somehow seeped into the controls and the vol down and rewind buttons stopped working. Also while exercising the headphones initiated a phone call on my cell phone (there is a button on them for that).Before this problem they were fantastic. Bottom line, wearing them while working out probably isn't a good idea but for everyday use they are champs, They take a lot of abuse and keep on going but they seem deathly afraid of sweat :)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B000SZ9I0K" id="B000SZ9I0K-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2007-08-17:</strong> Paired flawlessly with my Chocolate.  Have used it almost 30 feet away from the phone without losing connection!  The earbud covers - you get two different ones (one set of one, two of the other.)  The traditional, round, style have better sound but fill with sweat when working out. Literally fill - have to drain them every 15 minutes or so. The open style does not have this problem, but has poorer sound quality and lets in more ambient noise.Yes, you can only hear the phone calls in the left ear, but that's the communication's standard.  If your phone transmitted it in stereo, it would play in stereo.Basically, make sure you know the phone/mp3 player/whatever the device is standard.  Don't blame the car if you buy the wrong seat covers. Don't blame the headset if you purchase it for the wrong device!It supports all current bluetooth standards.

I carry my phone in my front pants pocket and the Bluetooth rarely cuts out while listening to MP3's.  I have an average size head and my ears start to hurt after about a half hour of listening with the stock rubber ear cushions. I have installed the included optional rubber cushions and it is better, but after an hour and a half it still starts to hurt. The back of the unit rests on my collar and the rubbing of the collar against the headphones transmits into the ears.The music is crisp and clear, but weak bass.  I turned up the base on my Razr V3xx, but it does not matter because the speakers do not play any bass.  It works great as a headset, pairs up with the phone instantly and answers calls automatically.  People hear me clearly on the other end. It charges with the phone charger or through a USB port.  Everything is okay except ... weak BASS.Addendum: I found out that if I remove my eye-glasses the base improves.  I guess the glasses keep the headset from forming a good seal.I would now give these 4 stars.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B000SZ9I0K" id="B000SZ9I0K-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2007-12-05:</strong> My ipod nano's wired headphones annoy me when I exercise, so I wanted to find a wireless alternative. I was a little hesitant about buying these headphones and the ipod adaptor because of some negative reviews, but after using them I was happy to find that I have had no problems. In fact, these work great. The headphones fit comfortably in my ear and are easy to take on and off. The sound quality is better than my ipod headphones and is actually quite good. The touch sensitive controls for volume etc. take a little getting used to, but with a little practice they are easy to operate.I am a runner and have used these headphones both on the treadmill in the gym as well as outdoors, including very windy days. I have not experienced any loss of signal once the bluetooth connection has been established--and I have run literally hundreds of miles with this headset. It is a real pleasure to listen to my ipod without wires dangling all over me.Please note that the bluetooth connection between the headphones and the ipod does not take place instantly. Turn the headphones on and wait for the solid blue light to come on that indicates that the headphones are in bluetooth mode. Then (1) turn on the ipod, (2) insert the adaptor (Note: inserting the adaptor before turning on the ipod did not permit a bluetooth connection to be established), (3) select the first song, and (4) hit the play button on the ipod. There is usually a delay of 10-40 seconds before the headphones make a bluetooth connection with the ipod. Not a big deal. I just restart the song from the beginning.Making a bluetooth connection with my Samsung u-740 cell phone was a snap, and answering calls on the headphones was easy. I had no problem with sound quality.Before purchasing these headphones and adaptor, you should keep some things in mind.First, in order to insert the adaptor into the opening on the bottom of the ipod, either your ipod must be out of the case or you need a case that will give access. I use the latest Contour clear case, which does not permit a completely snug fit(due to two small plastic tabs around the earphone hole; you can remove these if you want), but snug enough so that a bluetooth connection can be established and the adaptor is in tight enough so that I don't worry about it falling out, and in fact it hasn't happened even when I run over rough terrain in the park. I bought an armband intended for the ipod shuffle, and use the belt clip on my Contour case to clip my ipod and inserted adaptor to the armband when I run. Everything is nice and secure.Second, if you wear glasses, it works best to put the headphones on first and the glasses on second. The glasses won't fit quite as snugly as they normally do, but for exercise it will be fine. I found that if I put my sunglasses on first, the headphones did not fit as snugly in my ears, with a resulting loss in sound. The same thing applies if you wear a headband or bandana--put the headphones on first.Third, since the headphones are curved in the back, if you wear anything with a collar that sticks up in the back, the collar will push against the headphones, which will come slightly out of their position in your ears. So wearing the headphones with a ski jacket won't work very well. With a thinner collar, you will occasionally have to reposition the headphones as the collar pushes against them. Also, if you wear a ski hat to run, you will not be able to pull it down over your ears.Fourth, because of the back of the neck design, you will not be able to use these headphones comfortably to lay on your back (like on a blanket at the beach, a couch in your den, a chaise lounge by the pool) or to sit in a reclining position with your head back (like in a car or airplane).Fifth, because the bluetooth adaptor goes into the socket that is used for charging, there is no way to use the adaptor and charge your ipod at the same time, as you can do using earbuds. Therefore for a long car or plane ride you are better off using your earbuds or some other headset.So don't throw away your ipod earbuds or over-the-ear headsets, but do enjoy this unit in those situations where the limitations I described above don't matter.All in all I am very satisfied with this product. If you are looking for a wireless solution, albeit not a perfect one, this is it.Update Nov. 10, 2008: I have now been using this product for one year and have been very satisfied with its performance. However, I am now on my third pair.Shortly before Labor Day, the battery did not seem to be holding a charge, and I got a replacement set of headphones. I see from other reviews that other people have also had some battery issues, though I have no idea how widespread that is.I started going to a new gym this fall, and it tends to very humid where the treadmills are. A couple of nights ago I was drenched in sweat and so were the headphones. The volume control stopped working (it was stuck on the highest volume) and there was static coming out of one of the earbuds. Fortunately it was not too late to get another free replacement from the store where I purchased them.I note that all electronic items can be "zapped" by moisture unless they are specifically designed to be water resistant. It appears that these headphones are not. It never was an issue for me until I started running indoors at my new gym. Now that I know about the problem, I will just wipe them periodically before the sweat really builds up.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B000SZ9I0K" id="B000SZ9I0K-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-15:</strong> when u r work out it is so nice.i have been use it for 3 years it is so nice that when u work out it is so fit</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B000SZ9I0K', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B000SZ9I0K', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B005NJDYJM</h2>    <p class="price"> $B005NJDYJM</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005NJDYJM" id="B005NJDYJM-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-27:</strong> the case has a cool look and feel and a cool kick stand so you can watch videos without holding your phone but the case seems to wear out after a while</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005NJDYJM" id="B005NJDYJM-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-20:</strong> What more could you ask for?

Good and sturdy for watching movies, reading books, etc.Cut outs are accurate and provide easy access to all ports and buttons, as well as speaker.Thickness is good enough such that if I place it on a table, neither side is directly touching the surface.Overall, great case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005NJDYJM" id="B005NJDYJM-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-10-03:</strong> The best part of the case and holster combo for the Samsung Epic 4th Touch is the holster. The case does have a nice rubberized feel to it But it is in two pieces. There is a back piece and front piece that snaps on the front to keep the phone in place. The problem is the front plastic piece that holds the phone in the case, it doesn't snap together well enough. I could actually feel the front piece slipping out the notches on the case cover everytime I held the phone. While I was working (at the Post Office) my phone actually feel out the holster and the plastic snap on piece popped off the case.The phone hit my foot and was still in the back part of the case. I wiped my phone off then put it back in the Sprint case with the kickstand that I brought when I got the phone. I just see this as a $14.99 lesson. I am waiting for the official Seidio case and holster when Amazon.com sells them (might be more money but they phone with stay in the holster). That little plastic ring piece on the front of the case that holds the phone in place is the weakest part of the case. I called the case shallow because it is like a nice looking women that has nothing to offer but good looks.P.S. - There is no kickstand to be found on this $14.99 case. Oh don't waste your money unless you want to use your phone's insurance to get a replacement from Sprint when it falls to the ground.This Company change the Picture and description:This is Actually the case that Sprint sells (which is Better than the actual case I brought from this link).

I've used it for months now. The softer back has had some damage to it, but I'm rough on the cases. It's not bad enough to make a major cosmetic difference. The metal bracket used to stand up the phone on it's side has come off. The glue didn't hold it. But I just got some super glue out and glued the metal strip back onto the plastic channel for it in the case and it has worked great now for a couple or so months. I was afraid putting it on and off often would hurt the side buttons on my phone, but it's been just fine. I usually have to switch batteries out once a day since they run out. It's not too hard to get the case on and off. It mildly protects the screen by adding a little bit of an edge to the face of the phone, but that only works on flat smooth surfaces that likely wouldn't scratch it anyway. In any case, I would certainly buy this again. I use the stand several times a day. So, it has stood the test of many uses. I will say though, you have to have some pretty strong thumbnails. That stand is locked in there quite well. So it doesn't flip out when you don't want it to. But if you have long nails or thin nails, it might get frustrating to pull out the stand. For me it works well and I'm very glad I bought it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005NJDYJM" id="B005NJDYJM-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-10-16:</strong> As stated earlier, the case does not protect the top or bottom, BUT if your like me and you have a screen protector to save the beautiful screen of the phone, this case does not lift up the screen protector. I made the mistake of buying the case @ Sprint with the purple back on it....just to have some type of protection, it works good, it cover all sides, sits in snug, BUT it lifts off the screen protector. I use a Steinheil screen protector I absolutely love em & will not try any other company, and will not go without one, so, it had to go! Now the kickstand its a lil odd if your used to the Evo stand but it does what it supposed to do...sit your phone up in landscape mode. The case is very durable and not cheap feeling the "carbon fiber" looks ok, One thing I did notice is the holes for the buttons are raised slightly higher than the actual buttons, so you have to press inside the cutout to "find" the button...This is a good thing...because I bought the case logic holster for larger Android phones which is the only one I could find that fits the phone & it fits WITH the case on!!. And when I sat it in the case for some reason it would press the power and/or the volumes buttons either turning the phone off or turning down the volume...this case fixed that problem by "countersinking" the buttons. Plus Sprint sells this exact case for $29.99....Hope this helps...Peace!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005NJDYJM" id="B005NJDYJM-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-07:</strong> Owned this case almost 2 years and it never broke and it protected my phone from a few serious drops with minimal scratches.

The carbon fiber back is nice however not the reason i purchased it. The kickstand was the primary reason i purchased this case, after having an Evo I found that i really missed my kickstand and I would be reduced to propping my phone and having it fall over and over. The kickstand gives the perfect angle to view and admire your beautiful AMOLED display. This case would also provide great protection in the event of a drop, all of the cutouts are exact. It is also fairly easy to take on and off if you need access to your battery or micro-sd.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005NJDYJM" id="B005NJDYJM-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-10-04:</strong> I don't what the other 1 star reviewer was smokin' but this case comes in one-piece, carbon-fiber back and the kickstand feature is great for watching videos on my desktop or dining table.

I bought a couple other cases to see which one I like the best and currently keep rocking this bad boy right here.What I like most about this case, besides the built like a tank appearence is the front is really protected, from a fall or just about anything really. Reason why, is due to it being lifted a good inch, so when putting phone down face 1st, it will not touch any part of the ground, or where ever you put it down, unless you have some shag carpet, lol!It really attests for complete protection, which is #1 in my book, as I have a top of the line smartphone and is a pain to get it covered under insurance if something did happen to it....(Knocks on wood now, as I have terrible luck!)So if you are looking for complete coverage and a slick looking case and really is easy to take on and off, then look no further as the Ballsitic will do you no wrong!

This case works great for my HTC Amaze! I had one before, but it turned up missing, and that one I put through rather tough testing (some intentional, some not so intentional) and not only was my phone literally untouched, let alone harmed, but even the Ballistic case showed almost no signs of being tested or tampered with. All that, plus the absolutely unbeatable prie of less than $13 for a brand new one (depening on where on Amazon you buy it from)......... it's good. And I was especially shocked to see that this same case's retail price goes for like $35 (on their official website it says that). Obviouly, everyone is different, their phone serve them for different purposes, and their phone cases serve differet purposes as well. If you want a case for cosmetics, this is obviouly not the route to go. However, if you have an Amaze 4g, and are mostly concerned about protection from drops, bangs, and just anything that will possibly happen, THIS case is the way to go...... especially for its cost.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B006N8QJQW', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B006N8QJQW', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00001W0EQ</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00001W0EQ</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00001W0EQ" id="B00001W0EQ-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-13:</strong> good</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00001W0EQ" id="B00001W0EQ-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-03:</strong> I was a bit wary about buying this headset in used condition, but was lured by the half-price price tag when compared to a new headset.

The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I have had a lot of people tell me I sound somewhat distorted when talking on it.

The ear-pad is comfy, and I occasionally forget I have this on.  The best part is the adjustable amplifier - if I have distortion from the sound out of my cell phone, I can increase or decrease both the output from the cell phone itself and the amplifier on the headset, and I usually can maximize the sound and minimize distortion.

The 2.5mm jack means it won't fit on some mobile phones (this is smaller than a standard headphone jack), but for my Blackberry it's great (both 8820 and Pearl). As a bonus, I also use it with my XBOX 360 controllers (both with the attached messenger keyboard and without) for online gaming. Some people have observed that I sound a little distant with this headset while plugged into the wireless XBOX controller, but repositioning the mic to be as close to my mouth as possible fixes it.There is an adjustable mic sensitivity switch on the plug, but this doesn't seem to make any difference to people at the far end of the conversation.It's held up quite well over the past few years, being stuffed in bags and traveling around. It's not as cool as the wireless headsets (bluetooth etc) but it doesn't take batteries, doesn't have to be recharged and isn't subject to interference.

This also helps to eliminate air bubbles and such from under the protector.  Be sure to apply this screen protector in the evening before going to bed so it can sit over night unused while the screen protector dries onto the glass.TIP:  Grab your cell phone and all supplies.  Super clean the bathroom while steaming up the room to prevent dust from becoming air born.

The process  requires using the provided liquid spray  on the screen protector  which then  becomes very slippery and a tad cumbersome to align and then to squeegee off the excess liquid. The company did a great job with packaging and instructions and went the extra mile to provide an online video on how to correctly install the protector.With the screen protector being wet and slippery, I found it a bit challenging to see the cut outs and ended up with the camera circle being just a wee bit off. Each time I "squeegeed" the screen protector, it would move just enough to offset the tiny cutout for the camera.Leaving the phone to dry out overnight was a bit unusual as well since I rely on my phone for emergencies. I left the phone powered off.Next morning I was very pleased at what I saw. An almost crystal clear shield with NO bubbles. So what if my camera cut out ended up being a tad off.The clarity of the phone's display is virtually unaffected and the display is easy to read from all angles as if there is no film over it.The sensitivity of the screen protector is unbelievably great. Again, the phone responds as if there is no film over the screen.My apprehensions about applying this screen protector were unfounded.I am very happy with the ArmorSuit military Shield Screen Protector and would definitely recommend it. If Otterbox teamed up with this product and included it in with their cases, you would have the perfect case/screen-protector combo!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GXOT1KC" id="B00GXOT1KC-review27" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-15:</strong> Works better than most i have ever had and holds up better as well and a easy to put on.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GXOT1KC" id="B00GXOT1KC-review28" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-09:</strong> The original S5 screen was terrible with finger prints and smudges making it invisible in sunlight and making it hard to swype.

There are a few times that it doesn't turn off my screen, but that's not a big deal.The alarm on my phone auto-snoozed, but this isn't the fault of the case, it's a fault of the design of the phone's operating system.This case can be used with QI wireless charging.

One thing I didn't consider but feel is important is whether the magnetic latch is attached to the front or back cover. In this case it's the front cover which is good. I bought another case where it's attached to the back cover and the problem this creates is that you have to deal with both the latch and front cover separately when you open the case to use the phone. Not a problem with the Cruzerlite case. Fold the magnetic latch behind the front cover so it's sandwiched between the front and back covers and the magnet will hold the front cover in place; folded behind the phone.I have a card in each card slot and a third, with cash, in the larger slot. This does make it a little difficult to close but I'm certain this will improve over time. The rubber case that holds the phone is flexible enough to easily remove the phone which is good for me because my Nexus 5 will not charge on the latest Nexus Qi charger when it's in this case. (I did have success with the last gen "orb-style" Nexus charger). Build quality seems solid. Will post updates if that changes over time. Of the two wallet style cases that I bought this is easily the better of the two..by a wide margin. Would definitely recommend.This case does activate wake/sleep state on the phone when you open the front cover.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00G4JJLNS" id="B00G4JJLNS-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-21:</strong> I got this case today, I am really glad I did!

I currently have 2 cards in the wallet, my Mass drivers license (thin) and a Google Wallet card (average thickness, no raised text). The case will close, and stay closed, but it takes some &#34;mushing&#34; to make sure its securely closed, and latched.The case fits the phone very well as with any Cruzerlite case, but it's starting to peel my iSmooth screen protector at the 4 corners of the phone. It's not a big deal, but I added a screen protector so any dirt and grit from the cards wouldn't scratch the screen when in my pocket, or backpack.I will update this with more info as time goes on--</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00G4JJLNS', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00G4JJLNS', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B009YY95D6</h2>    <p class="price"> $B009YY95D6</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009YY95D6" id="B009YY95D6-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-06:</strong> I really appreciate the red color for easy spotting in my car armrest compartment.

I have used it to charge an iPod classic and an Android phone on multiple occasions. It's very convenient to have the capability of having two devices charge at one time, but there are drawbacks. The cord is fairly short, and it doesn't &#34;wind up&#34; or have any tension, as the picture seems to suggest. It will lay completely flat, and it results in a somewhat awkward process when it gets caught somewhere. The problem is further underlined when the second cord, plugged into the free USB port, is significantly longer than the iPod/iPhone cord.Overall conclusion: I would rather invest in a charger with two ports. That would allow me to alternate devices, use only one cord at a time, get two cords with similar lengths, and make it more compact without the cords. If this was used for an iPhone, it would be a more practical purchase, but for me, when I need an Android charged more than any other device, it is not ideal.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009YY95D6" id="B009YY95D6-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-27:</strong> I love the velvety smooth feel of TYLT's flat ribbon car charger. It is just the right length at 2 feet to put on the seat, console, cup holder, or phone holder, but short enough to prevent the user from being able to talk on the phone while driving - and it should be. It fits in the iPhone just snug enough to not fall out, but can easily be removed if needed to make or receive a call. The other end fits in the power outlet/lighter socket with the right amount of strength. I haven't plugged another USB device in the extra charging socket, but that's only because I really don't have anything else to charge. The TYLT ribbon cable charges the iPhone pretty quickly too - more like a quick charger than a trickle charger. Some other reviewers indicate the cable should have an LED to show the phone is charging, and that would be nice, but looking on the phone's display isn't that difficult. The flat ribbon design avoids tangling, especially during storage, I just kind of bunch it up and put it away. Overall it is a nice charger, has nice style, is bright and colorful, but may a little bit over priced.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009YY95D6" id="B009YY95D6-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-05:</strong> I was a late comer to the iPhone and iPad. In fact, had I not opted to become a Freshman at Winthrop University shortly after my 78th birthday, I would not have had enough coins in my purse to get them, but for the Pell grant! However I quickly learned that these two devices, particularly the phone, love to gobble up power -- battery stored power, that is. I had invested in a car charger, but its black cords and stuff made it look a lot like the power cord for my GPS, and that was confusing. So when I received this car charger, the first thing that struck me about it was that its bright red color was awesome -- no way to confuse this with the GPS cord.

Both our phones often need charging at the same time when we are out and about, and that's the best thing about this. Only qualm I would have is that you probably won't have a super easy time using your phone while it's charging if your cigarette lighter is far away from you in the car, and that is because the cord doesn't stretch very far.

Over time the think plastic casing around the fiber optics wear out or tear (at least in my experience).  TYLT delivers a flat cord that is made of strong silicone that is durable enough to stand up to any type of abuse.  Although I've only had it a few weeks, there's not doubt in my mind that this will last.  Yes, it is not a lightening style charger, it is meant for older apple devices.  However, the included USB port allows for the addition of any other type of USB charger you would have.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009YY95D6" id="B009YY95D6-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-21:</strong> This is definitely more rugged than the skinny round wires I usually have hanging out of my car charger.

First of all it is RED, which means it is identifiable a MINE and NOT one of the kids.  Otherwise, all my charging cables &#34;mysteriously&#34; disappear.  Second, I love that it is wide and flat.  It comes right out of the glove box (does anyone actually use the glove box for gloves anymore?) straight, untangled, and ready to use - no attempting to untie knots while driving.  Also, it is easy to find by touch, so you are never taking your eyes off the road.  Next, it will charge either an ipad (we always need more charging capability on long trips!) by itself, or two smaller devices (iPhone, blackberries, etc) at the same time.  That is a really, really nice feature.The only note that I would point out here is that the built in ipad connector is the old style.  If you have an ipad mini or an iPhone gen 5, you will need to provide the correct cable and plug it into the USB port.  But that would not stop me from buying more TYLT BAND FLAT DUAL CAR APPLE/USB CAR CHARGERs.

You can plug not only a 4S iphone (or below) into it, but you can plug in a second usb device. Or, if you have an iphone 5 or 5C or 5S, then you can plug that cord into the USB port of this cable. The only downside is that the cord is pretty short. It's really not long enough to keep charged while you have the phone to your ear (although I guess you're not supposed to have the phone to your ear while driving!). But that is pretty minor.

Not only is the design massively cool looking, but it works like a charm!  The TYLT band is two feet in length, and is made out of the same stuff most cell phone cases are lined with, a nice smooth silicone material.  It's as wide as a ruler, and the material is perfect for non-tangled cables!  I, personally, hate trying to drive and wiggle out the knots in my car charger at the same time.  It's so easy to plug up when you realize your battery is on the downward slope to oblivion!  There is seriously no need to worry about another tangled car charger with this particular style.  I also found it to be very, very durable.  My niece found the charger, and had fun with it, which included being stepped on, half smashed between a cabinet drawer, and stretched as a bracelet before I saved the day, and there is literally no damage.  This cable does only work for an Iphone 4s or later as it has the 30 pin connector, and not the updated lightning pin.  BUT...this car charger also includes a USB port right at the front where the charging area pops into your car's cigarette lighter.  So technically you can charge an Iphone 5 or 5s, by plugging in an extra cable.  I did try this, and it worked totally fine, charging my phone up very quickly!I noticed some reviewers stating that the cable didn't feel secure when plugged in to the cigarette lighter or to their device, but mine felt perfectly fine.  There was no wiggle room, and everything fit very securely and snug.  And this was plugging up an Iphone 4s, using, of course, the cigarette lighter, and using the USB port by plugging up my Iphone 5s.  Again, it was all a very secure fit.  I've had no issues with this charger at all!  It isn't very long in length, but my charger is very close to me, and I've actually been able to make a call while charging in.  But I am a tiny individual who sits close to the wheel as it is.  All in all I have to say I love this charger, and it's definitely worth it!As a side note, one of my coworkers saw this charger, and immediately purchased three as Christmas presents for her children!  It's just that awesome!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009YY95D6" id="B009YY95D6-review27" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-26:</strong> This is a very convenient, heavy-duty car charger that actually looks good.

It is STURDY.  For someone who has crushed, stomped, and run over a fair number of cords in the last 30 years or so, sturdy is a big deal.  It seems to work, which I find surprising, given its strange configuration.What I don't like as much: It only fits a very limited range of equipment.  It does not fit entirely snugly, nor does it charge steadily. I only used it on an aged Apple i-pod, so that may have a bearing on the performance of the dual charging device.  I don't know that it can actually dual charge, as promised, but I'm not willing to say it won't. And, as with the other TYLT products I've reviewed, it has really skimpy documentation.  No tips or tricks on how to make it seat better, either into the i-pod, or into the car charger.As is also typical with TYLT products, there's a certain elegance in design, yet there's also an awkward execution. It doesn't quite live up to its potential.

There is also a USB port, which I haven't yet tried to charge my Android devices, but I expect it'll do similarly well for those. My primary complaint is that the cable is a foot too short. Plugged into the rear center console, the kids can't use devices still. In the center console, it doesn't reach the dash. Only the 12v plug on the dash is feasible.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009YY95D6" id="B009YY95D6-review32" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-06:</strong> I got this through Amazon's Vine Program and I have to say I like the design; it works well for me.

This has been very helpful for my husband and I to charge both our phones. I charged my iPad with this charger (only one device charging at the same time) and it charged at the same speed my iPad charges with the standard wall charger, so it has a good deal of power and helps your phones charge quickly.In addition I absolutely love the design and the material. It is this strange rubbery material that doesn't get scratched or damaged, so it holds up well in your car (we have stepped on and broken a couple of the harder plastic charger ports already).

I was prepared to be bored, but it has become a staple in our cars that do not have built in USB charging ports.Pros:1. Both iPhone and USB charging ports that can be used in parallel. I have mine connected to both the iPhone and my battery case in parallel for much faster charging overall.2. The tangle free ribbon actually does not tangle. It is about the right length for all of my four possible applications (1996 Accord, 2006 Honda Van, 2013 Volt, and 2006 Prius).3. The loud color is a plus in the dark upholstered interiors of my cars. I can find the thing.4. The plugs at each end are designed to allow you to use a thumb to press them in vs. having to grab the sides as in most chargers.a. This allows more leverage in a tight power plug.b. The offset design allows you to know top from bottom without looking.5. The cable housing (rubber cover) is molded over both connectors so as to provide strain relief as well as protection. Your chances of pulling this unit apart are therefore greatly reduced by design.6. The voltage converter in the plug does not seem to inject hum or noise the way some cheaper ones do, into the iPhone audio played back via the car speakers.Cons:I can't think of any other than the packaging it arrived in. It was very excessive in its use of materials, I would say. This would not prevent me from buying it, but the enclosure makes a lot of use of plastic and has almost more material it it than the product itself. The biggest example for me was the heavy duty plastic collar around the clear plastic container. The collar and package together made me think that this was supposed to be a permanent case for the charger, but it isn't. It's to be tossed or recycled after opening as it would be very inconvenient to re-use for a number of reasons I won't detail here. What is the point of this? It looked cool, but I bet they could have achieved this without the extra packaging. Keep in mind, I am not a tree hugger, either (e.g. eat meat, vote Republican, don't believe in global warming, etc.). So, this had to be pretty excessive for me to take note.Conclusion:Great little device!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009YY95D6" id="B009YY95D6-review37" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-01:</strong> There is not much to say except that the packaging was very classy and the device can charge an iDevice and another USB device, eg Android.

The sleek style is particularly neat, and it works. It even has an auxiliary USB port to enable the charging of two phones instead of just one in the car.  The only flaw in the otherwise great plan is that it would be helpful to have an indicator LED light indicating the the charger insert is all the way in. It is rather a snug fit with it's squared off style, and it is difficult to tell if it is all the way into the receptacle in the dashboard.  A little LED on top like most of the car chargers have would be a plus.  I do have to comment on the packaging --- it was so very elaborate and clearly expensive to produce.

The one thing that I missed was the original BlackBerry brand holster case.  The BB cases are by far the best holster cases that I have used or seen.  The clip is very strong, doesn't slip off of my belt, and swivels.  I've thoroughly abused 5 or 6 BlackBerry holster cases, and none of them have broken or failed.Since switching to the iPhone, I have continued to use different BlackBerry cases--they aren't a perfect fit, but they work fine.Now that I have an iPhone 5, I've been looking for months for a decent holster for it. I know the generic holster cases won't hold up.  I've been using the Bold 9900 case, but the iPhone 5 is a little too large.The Z10 case works great for the iPhone 5.  It's about a 1/4" wider and 1/4" taller than the iPhone 5, but that isn't a problem for me.  I use anelago S5 Slim Fit 2 Case for iPhone 5 - eco friendly Retail Packaging - Soft Feeling Dark Graycase on my iPhone, and the thickness is just right for the Z10 case--there's actually a little extra room.So for those looking for a great holster case, this one works great for an iPhone...or a Z10.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00AZY9OJO', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00AZY9OJO', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B004G8QNDA</h2>    <p class="price"> $B004G8QNDA</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004G8QNDA" id="B004G8QNDA-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-21:</strong> Geez, AT&T and other phone carriers really have the nerve to provide you their own phones that turn out to be garbage than some other phone you find like this one, that turns out to be even better. This phone works much better than the AT&T did out the box. I was able to boot it for just 3 seconds while the old one from AT&T booted up for 10-15 seconds. Now I know who to buy a new blackberry from when this one breaks because seriously, phone carriers NEVER give you excellent service that you should expect from a phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004G8QNDA" id="B004G8QNDA-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-10:</strong> This cell has worked for me perfectly.

I am delighted that it worked with AT&T; 3G bands.I must say that I missed the keypad and it's been a wonder and huge relief to have physical feel on the typing, certain very assuring feel.  Also Blackberry 6 is definitely a nice update (device not supported by Blackberry 7) and a huge difference from my old Curve back in Feb  2009 when I last had it.  The menus and executions are fast and the aesthetics of the OS are polished--pleasing if that is what others would say although I didn't load it up with tons of apps as it is only a temporary device.  It has Vlingo - Siri's BB counterpart, not as intelligent as Siri but does the job.  I don't do socials very much so I didn't care about FB, Tweeter and social feeds although its got a unified social feed status.The track pad is very responsive, unless your finger is wet or oily, then you need more skin traction.The Blackberry Desktop for Mac is one that i love very much.  My Mac address book (not icloud, local address book), and calendar entries synced without a glitch.Keypad is still here to stay I guess.Just some thoughts about setting up BIS and for those with $30 Data Unlimited iPhone Plan:I initially had problem setting up the BIS because the device is not recognized by the network as this unit from Amazon is unlocked.  I called AT&T; and reported the IMEI and PIN of the device, rebooted and everything went well, including setting up my AOL email account on the BIS from the phone (does not allow you to setup BIS through your Mac or PC browser--very strange).  My $30 Data Unlimited iPhone plan which I had since Feb 2009 was converted to same $30 Data Unlimited Blackberry plan.  AT&T; rep assured me that I can switch back to same Data Unlimited iPhone plan when it is released.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004G8QNDA" id="B004G8QNDA-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-17:</strong> A phone that has fallen behind the times in comparision to Android and Iphone.

I bought one about a year ago and after dropping my phone several times on even hard surfaces, it has protected my phone completely. The edges of this case have become cracked a little so I bought another to replace it (they're $2!), but that's my fault, not the case's. Like I said, I've had it a year and feel confident it would last quite some time. I also like that the droplets are 3D to help grip.

The cover is made of hard plastic (not rubber or silicon) so not sure how much protection it offers in accidental drops.  Important to note is that the sides coverage ends just below the frontal face of the iPhone which means that if the iPhone is placed faced down, the front glass is touching the table.  If you are very careful with your phone, this is a nice case for the cheap price.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006JW3BYU" id="B006JW3BYU-review100" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-29:</strong> I have not used this case much but when it was on my phone it had a nice ombr&eacute; look to it.

The look and feel in one's hand is superbly minimalistic; It matches my phone; and it does well against drops and bumps.As for longevity: this is the second Diztronic case I've ordered. The last was for my Atrix 2. It held up for all two years of my Atrix 2's lifespan. This new one for my S4 Active seems to be of the exact same quality, which is excellent.If you are looking for a super do-it-all, protect your phone against space, water, asteroids, gamma radiation, and whatever else, don't consider the Diztronic. The bulky Otterbox cases do that. If you need a quality, good looking case for general shock and scratch protection, this case is it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DD46UHC" id="B00DD46UHC-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-08:</strong> Thin with just enough protection to keep your phone looking new.

My primary concern was a possibility of receiving a used product.  Clay's explanation of the blemish by the USB port area convinced me that the case I received was new.  The finish could still be improved however. Small blemish aside, the case is beautiful and very comfortable to hold, fits perfectly, and very slim.  I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a slim case that would still offer some protection to your phone.Original Review:I ordered my case through Diztronnic's eBay store.  The case was shipped promptly but I'm not happy with the case's finish.  I ordered a Matte Back Charcoal Gray Flexible TPU Case for a Galaxy S4 Active.  The case has worn out area right by the charging port where one would normally use a fingernail to open the rubber gasket.  Not sure if it's a manufacturing defect but it looks like the rubber coating is worn out from use.  The case itself is super slim and doesn't affect the size of the S4 Active too much but the product's finish could be better.  Either that or they sent me a used case.The case fits well, feels nice and actually looks nice on the S4; hence, the 3 star rating.  But from issue I mentioned above, I'm not too confident it will last too long.  For the price, it's not worth the time to return for an exchange or refund.  But I'm not sure I would be buying another product from Diztronic.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DD46UHC" id="B00DD46UHC-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-28:</strong> I've always had an otterbox case but they didn't have one for the s4 active so I bought this one.  I really am glad I did.  The matte black is awesome, feels great in my hands its thinner than an otterbox too.  It's taken quite a few falls so far and not a scratch dent or crack anywhere.  I provides a notch less of protection than n otterbox but the case also adds on less bulk and weight.  I think its just the right amount of protection.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DD46UHC" id="B00DD46UHC-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-07:</strong> This fitted correct to the device and no problems in using.

And I thought the colors would be cool.This seller got the package to me quickly, and everything was there. I tried out a few of the colors, and the trackballs move nice and smoothly. Maybe not quite as fluid as a trackball on a brand new Blackberry, that is why I took away one star. But I've had no problems so far. And they were easy to install. I've instaled trackballs before, but for someone who has never done this before, you use the included "guitar pick"-like tool they send to gently pry out the silver retaining ring, take out the old trackball, place the new trackball in the slot, and snap a new ring into place. It's realy easy and takes just a couple minutes.For the mechanically disinclined, maybe 5 minutes.This is a good replacement for a good price.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B002YGYOBY" id="B002YGYOBY-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-08-06:</strong> This is way better than buying an OEM trackball, plus it looks way cooler!

My Blackberry is very heavily used and I have already gone through two trackballs and at least one of the other Blackberry devices have begun to act sluggish. Since it seems that this is going to be a regular occurrence, a set of 5 trackballs seemed like a good investment.These are decent quality and the colors are nice for variety. The included "opening tool" (looks like a guitar pick) is just about worthless for removing the silver retaining ring, so I just used a utility knife point to pop it out. Once the retaining ring is off, just pop out the old one, put in the new one, and replace the retaining ring (use the original or one of the included replacements).These are a fairly inexpensive way to self service your Blackberry. I decided to try this first before taking it to the Sprint store to fix, so likely saved a lot by doing it myself.Recommended!CFH</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B002YGYOBY" id="B002YGYOBY-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-05-16:</strong> My CrackBerry trackball suffers from greasy fingers, exposure to elements, and all kinds of crap. I'm surprised it lasted as long as it did. Actually, what did it in was my feeble attempt to clean it. I took it a part, cleaned the little magnetic bits, put it back together and managed to cram it back in place. The ball worked better but was oriented 90 degress off! Argh...Then I looked on Amazon for a replacement was was dismayed to find they were only $2-$3 a piece. After reading the reviews, I noticed that some balls are inferiors. So I ordered this five pack. If one gets clogged, I've got more!Replacing was easier with the little blue tool. It popped out the retaining ring. I replaced the trackball and tried to replace the retaining ring. The "legs" on these retaining rings are a thinner metal. It's hard to line the legs up properly. Fortunately, my original retaining ring still worked fine. I used it.My CrackBerry is now fixed and the trackback glows green!

It looked really nice and worked like a charm- for a day.  On day two, the "Charging is not supported with this accessory" appeared.  I unplugged and plugged it back in.  Still no go.  I had no choice but to take it off and return it.  Upon visiting mophie.com, I realized that even Amazon is not an authorized dealer, not to mention "Fulfill by Amazon".  Buy this from your wireless carrier.  From Bestbuy.  Even from Gamestop!  You will sleep much better knowing you get a real one with a year warrantee.EDIT: Now I have had this case for 2 weeks now, I can say...1. I ordered it when it said it was sold by Fireball.  When it was shipped, it said it was from MobileCityOnline, which was an authorized dealer.  After comparing it to another one from the Verizon store under a magnified glass, it was real.2. Even the Verizon store one gave me the "Charging is not supported with this accessory".  As it turned out, if your phone got charged way ahead of the battery case, this message will show up.  Not every time but very likely.  If you just leave it alone, it will still charge both regardless.3. It still won't sync with your iTunes with the case on.4.

I use my phone for my job, so I'd kill the Helium every day, and come home running on fumes - generally at about 4% of the battery life. If I had a dinner or something after work, I was dead in the water.The Plus pack is *exactly* what I needed.  It's heavier than the Helium, but I don't mind that in the slightest.  It's pretty slim-line for the amount of backup battery it provides - I can generally get almost 2 full recharges out of it through the day.  The case is a matte silvery red color (I know this sounds weird - just trust me on this), and it's attractive without being gaudy.The only complaint I have is the rubberized border around my case has started to wiggle a little bit.  It doesn't affect the functionality of the case at all, but I have this sneaking suspicion it's going to eventually fall off.  I didn't ding the case in my rating for this, as it just might be my case only - Mophie generally makes a pretty good product.Bottom line: if you need a single charge for a backup, go with the Helium.  If you need something heavy-duty that looks good at the same time, go with the Plus.

Final result was - Mophie won!Pros:Volume, ringer and sleep buttons - THESE ARE AWESOME! This case has a design that matches the iPhone buttons very well. Doesn't have plastic buttons covering your metal iPhone controls or a cutout that you need to reach into - this design is fantastic!Rubbery feeling case - doesn't slip in my hand or get fingerprints on itOn/off button - I like that I decide when the battery pack is charging my phone back upBattery level button - With one tap, you can easily see how much battery is left (in 25% increments)Lip protects screen - many of the other cases I tested didn't have enough of a lip to protect the screen in case of a fall. I'm clumsy, so the Mophie had the best design for me by farGreat speaker design - not sure if it just redirects the sound, but I much prefer having my sound in the front of the phone, and it also seems louderCons:It's only a 2100 mAh instead of 2400 like others I testedPrice is higher, but it is totally worth the extra investment.That's pretty much it.

If you use a holder, it's going to be a big issue.  I tend to keep my phone in my pocket, and it does not bother me at all.Another big potential deal breaker.  It takes a micro-USB to charge.  If you need to dock with the lighting plug, you can't use it while the external case is on.  If you're like me and have a bunch of micro USB chargers laying around and don't need the dock, you'll actually appreciate this.This case does allow another full charge and is invaluable when traveling.  And it offers quite a bit of protection while doing so.

Apparently many of the bad reviews are because people are getting counterfeit products, but, since I got mine from the Apple store, it's the real thing. As far as I'm concerned, this is the best case you can get for your iphone. It offers several advantages. First, of course, it provides the protection of a case. The one thing I wish it had was a screen protector, this case will not help to protect the screen. Second, it really extends your phone's run time. Obviously, your results may not be the same as mine, but I have been running it for 2 days, and still have 2 of the 4 lights showing on the case, and of course, my iphone battery itself has not been used at all. That is amazing. It will make your phone a bit bigger, but that's a small price to pay for the protection and extra battery life you get. Another advantage to this case is that you can charge both the case and the iphone using a standard micro USB cable. Since Apple insists on using proprietary USB cables for no good reason, this can make things much easier if you happen to be out and don't have your lightning cable with you. This will allow you to use the same USB cable that just about every other mobile device uses. So, there you have it, you may want to purchase directly from the mophie web site, to be sure you don't get a fake product. If you get the real thing, it's a great product for sure.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AX49VBW" id="B00AX49VBW-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-11:</strong> Took my iPhone 5 from charging 1 to 2 times per day, depending on business and travel, to lasting almost 48 hours in some instances.

It's a great balance between practicality and size.  The mophie juice pack throws this out the door.  It adds a significant amount of size to the phone.  It's not a game ender though.  The phone is still small, but it's now twice as thick and slightly longer and wider.As for charging, I did some tests.  I completely drained the juice pack plus to zero.  I then charged the juice pack up to 100%. While the juice pack was charging, I ran my phone down to 10% battery.  I then put the phone and mophie back together and started charging.After 1 hour I was up to 68%. After 2.25 hours I was up to 99%.  At this point I stopped the charging process and turned off the mophie.  The light indicator was showing 1 light left on the mophie battery.  Once my phone got down to 70%, I turned the mophie back on to see how much charge I would have left, and it charged me back up to 86% before running out of juice.Also, it takes about 3 hours to fully charge the juice pack.Although the size bothers me, I think the design is the best they could do.  It's a high quality case.  The buttons on the side and top are very nice and accurate, and much better than having cut-outs there.  The speaker and mic redirectors at the bottom of the phone work just fine, and although the headphone extension cable is one more thing to keep track up, it does work well.I used a bose docking station at my office, so during a normal week, my phone is always charged.  However, when traveling, or over a busy weekend of high phone usage, I have encountered not having enough battery.  My plans for this case are to not have it on the phone at all times (I have to disconnect the bottom part of the case to dock it to my bose speaker anyway).  I will just use this during times when I think I'll need more battery than what the phone can give me. It will be a handy accessory, but I won't have to deal with the large case all the time.  Mophie did a good job with this and it's a very high quality product.  It's more expensive than it's competitors, but I think the quality justifies this.  Also I have a ZAGG invisible shield on the front and back of my phone and the case still goes on my phone with no problems.Just a small side note, those who complain that it's a micro USB on the bottom and not a lightning connector, this is not Mophie's fault.  Of course they would have used lightning if they could have.  This is a restriction that Apple puts on 3rd party hardware makers. They can access the lightning port on the phone (i.e. bose sound dock, mophie juice pack for charging), but they are not allowed to then replicate the lightning connector on the outside of the case.  So Mophie had to use the micro USB.  At lease they used a universal connector so it's easy to find  cable for this if you lose yours.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AX49VBW" id="B00AX49VBW-review23" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-23:</strong> I wish I could give this case more than 5 stars...it is that good. Initially I had purchased the Mophie Air. It looks almost identical to the Plus. I used the the Air for a few days before taking it back to BestBuy. It was killing my reception and I was very frustrated with it. I listen to podcasts and online sports talk radio on my phone while at work. Let me state for the record, I do not get the best reception at work, HOWEVER, as soon as I began using the Air my reception got even worse! I was constantly getting &#34;no service&#34; and &#34;text didn't send&#34; indications. My tunein, iheart and Sirius radio apps were constantly dropping and trying to reconnect. I got extremly tired of seeing that spinning ball while I waiting for my favorite sports talk show to reconnect!! I was just about to give up on Mophie's and charging cases all together. I then decided to exchange the Air. My intention was to get another Air, in hopes that the first one was just defective. Well, I changed my mind and got the Plus. I even bought a completely different color too. To make a long story short, the Plus works like a charm! It is almost like night and day. Reception is no longer an issue. I listened to the NCAA tournament on tunein all day and rarely did I lose my connection. Now to discuss the performance of the Plus. I let my phone's battery run down to 19% and then flipped the switch on the Mophie Plus. It charged my phone back up to 100% in probably an hour or so. Not only that, the Mophie still had some juice left in it. After my phone hit 100% I left the Mophie on for over 3 more hours. My phone never dropped below 100% I then recharged the Mophie...but even then it still was not completely dead. It still had one light lit! I was blown away. This case is awesome.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AX49VBW" id="B00AX49VBW-review24" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-16:</strong> This is my third Mophie Juice Pack, currently the Juice Pack Plus for my iPhone 5 and now on my iPhone 5s. It works great for a few months, then the connection for charging the phone begins to cycle back and forth. I am an engineer and troubleshot that it is either the pin connections between the two halves of the case or the switch connection itself. I have to pull the case bottom off and reset it, and also sometimes I have to turn the charging switch on to off and back to on again. The connections are clean, no bends. The cycling is annoying because your phone starts to beep every 5 seconds, going from charge to not charging. You have to pull the phone from your pocket and pull and reconnect the base. Also, when you push the charge level button the LED lights do not light up when this happens. This is my third Mophie Juice Pack to do this.Also, the back of the case scratches very easily, and it is pretty marred up from simply carrying it in my pocket.On a previous unit the micro USB connector went bad, and no matter what connector I used, it would not keep a good charging connection.If the cycling keeps up, I will try to get a warranty replacement.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AX49VBW" id="B00AX49VBW-review25" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-23:</strong> The beauty of the iphone 5 is how light weight it is, and how thin the form factor is.

It wouldn't change to 100% like it said it does. I called them back and they upgraded me to the Juice Pack Plus in White. This one is by far the best case I've owned. I have a case collection of 76 or so cases and I find myself using this one because it really does give 120% extra battery and I'm ALWAYS on my phone so it dies quickly.

Its instructions tell you to wet the surface with water or some proprietary fluid but I just stuck it on after wiping the screen with lens cleaning fluid, making sure there was no dust also. Any bubbles are easily worked out with the cloth and plastic card provided.As far as protection, I don't know. I put it on so it would take the damage from hard materials like sand. The screen itself is pretty impervious to softer things like most metals. Just note that it doesn't even cover all of the non-curved parts of the screen. It's just wide enough to cover the display (so you have to be precise in placement) and goes up to the top of the earpiece and down to the bottom of the home button. That means the touch buttons on either side are kinda-sorta covered. It would have been better if they extended down a bit more to at least cover the touch button lights.Once it's installed, it provides a matte surface that resists visible fingerprints and softens reflections. Instead of reflecting like a mirror, some rays will be scattered slightly off. However, there is still a visible reflection if you happen to have a bright light source on the other side of a coplanar normal from you. Still, it's beneficial to have on as blurry objects aren't as distracting.However, this matte surface is achieved by making it bumpy on a microscopic level. This is what makes what people are calling a "pixelation" effect. This is actually an inaccurate term. What is really happening is that because the surface is bumpy, the screen protector turns into a convex lens in some places and a concave lens in others, resulting in a slight magnification of certain subpixels and diminution of others. Yes, I know that MediaDevil said this would happen and I know that when I bought it. MediaDevil says this can't be avoided but I don't quite believe it. There is no such effect on most desktop monitors with a matte surface, which uses the same strategy. The difference is that the bumps on desktop monitors are on a significantly smaller scale than the subpixels, so they don't really get bigger or smaller than their neighboring subpixels. On the Galaxy S III, with 306 pixels per inch, the bumps are too similar in scale. Why is it so impossible to decrease the scale? Is the surface lose durability if the bumps are smaller? I don't know. It isn't an issue of wavelength. If the deepest red is 740nm, one would have to get to at least 5000ppi (with equal RGB subpixels) to have a wavelength problem.Knocking one star off for not advancing science.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008EOXKXI" id="B008EOXKXI-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-01:</strong> This is great!

It fits the screen nicely, no it does not extend to the outer left and right sides of the phone (beyond the ends of the screen) but I think that is perfect because if you have a case on the phone the case will not peel off the screen protector.

However, mine doesn't stick on some edges. And yes, it's applied correctly. It just doesn't seem a perfect fit. I had a betch of a time trying to get it to cover the screen correctly (line up along both edges evenly) and line up evenly with the home button. Right now, there's a bit that's not sticking right along the top edge of the home button. It just wouldn't work. The top two corners don't stick correctly either, especially the left side. I think someone else had this issue too. The same kind of thing happened with the screen protectors for my iPad 1, where some areas around the edge just weren't sticking like they should. Eventually, I just moved on and was extra careful not to lift the sides of the film. It'll be the same thing here. A good thing was that there were no bubbles.Update: The unadhered edges don't seem to create much of a problem. Also, the film itself is so smooth. I like it a lot, as long as the edges don't lift up.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008EOXKXI" id="B008EOXKXI-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-14:</strong> I use my phone mostly for internet access and watching videos... and this thing, just like any other Anti-Glare screen, causes an effect that causes any white/bright screen to 'sparkle' from the refraction in the matte coating.

Above all, this was easy to install compared to other protectors.  If you get it crooked or a piece of lint finds its way in, you can lift a corner and realign or get the lint with either tweezers or a piece of tape.  Doing so does not ruin the protector where the lint where nor does it render the corner you lifted 'broken'.  This is the only one of 3 (MediaDevil, Aduro, Halo) I bought recently where I was able to use a single protector and not accidentally waste one trying to get it perfect.update: I bought anothe MediaDevil.  They always give me the right product, on-time, with an e-mail support of YouTube video on installation and a link to their website, with a sweet little bonus in the envelope.

I was linked to their application video that they sent in an e-mail to me that explained how to put it on without bubbles.  I followed the youtube video, took a hot shower, and then boom put it on without a single bubble.  Literally the only screen protector I've ever put on a phone that had no bubbles at all.  The other plus was that these don't cover the entire front face of the phone they only cover the actual screen real estate so it fits perfectly and works with my Urban Assault Gear (UAG for those searching amazon reviews) case.  I've been using it for a few days now and it really is reducing the amount of oil that appears on my screen.  I still wipe it off at the end of the day, but not every few times I swipe because I turned the screen off and see smudges.  I definitely recommend these matte screen protectors.  It does take away from some of the screen clarity, but the screen is still very bright, highly responsive, and stays very clean.

Also, be aware that only the right speaker at the base of the iPhone actually gets channeled into the horn. The sound from the left speaker shoots out a little hole in the bottom, unaltered. It shipped directly from China, so you get to receive a box with interesting Chinese postage markings.** edit ** It's been pointed out that there is only one speaker, so the horn is actually capturing all of the sound output from the one mono speaker.

This dashboard mount is the best I've ever used. I thought my last one was the best, but this one is great. I have the note 3 with the Otter box defender series case (a very heavy and substantial case) and I had no problem using this mount. I live on a very bumpy road and the only problem I have is when I'm going down my road the phone tilts a little on the mount by the time I get to the end of my road. (it doesn't fall off just tilts a little) My road is the only road I've ever noticed a problem on and when I say it's bumpy, it's really tore up. I use the large magnet cause the small round one was too small to keep my phone on the mount because of the weight. (both magnets are included with the mount)  I've used this mount for about 6 months and it's still great. One time I did notice that it messed up my gps directions (I use gps a lot) and I had to restart my gps. This could've been an error with the google maps app though but it was moving my location the wrong way and when I restarted the app it was fine again. All in all a great mount that's very easy to use. Just put your phone to it and it sticks and then it's very easy to get your phone back off again. I used to use the IOttie one touch extra large phone mount which I loved also but it wouldn't fit my note 3 when I got the defender series case by Otter Box so I gave it to my husband and I love this one now. Give it a try to you won't be disappointed. I will say that when I first tried sticking the dashboard mount to my dash it wouldn't stick, but I found out it was my fault cause I was playing with the switch that makes it stick when I first got it and when you flick the switch that makes it stick to your dash, it makes the sticker that's stuck to the bottom suction cup suck in and it doesn't cover it all the way and I got like 2 specs of dust on the bottom. I went inside and ran the suction cup under hot water and shook the excess water off and went back outside and it stuck on the very first time and has not moved since. It has a strong suction cup once you click the switch down. I think that should be all that I know about the mount. I hope this helps someone that it wondering weather they should get this or not.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008IOQ3K6" id="B008IOQ3K6-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-25:</strong> I was stoked to get this mount because my Galaxy s4 has a case that I don't want to remove just to dock it. The mount sticks great to the windshield and any flat surface in my vehicles. The magnet is not so great. It has enough strength to hold the phone on the dock but sometimes my phone will get bumped to the side or flipped upside down, especially on hard turns or bumpy roads. If the rubber on the mount gets dusty, it is even less effective.I suppose that if I were able to center the metal plate on the back of my S4 it would have those problems but if I don't have the metal plate towards the bottom half of my phone, it will activate the S-cover sensor on my phone, the screen will turn black and I can't do anything but check the time.Another issue is that my phone's wireless Qi charger properly with the metal plate stuck to the back of my phone unless I put the plate under the battery cover which severely weakens the magnet to the point of where my phone will go flying off the dock if I hit a bump in the road. Taking the case off fixes that problem, but leaves my phone vulnerable which isn't an option for me.In my situation, this dock is not worth it, should have kept the packaging and returned it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008IOQ3K6" id="B008IOQ3K6-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-27:</strong> This is the 2nd mount I bought.

Not so good for nav, but I always used my Garmin for that because better voice nav on the iPhone didn't exist. Now that voice nav is enabled on Google Maps, the iPhone is a credible navigation device in the car. Sorry Garmin, I love your products but I'm not spending $200 twice. When my fifth battery finally gave out on my trusty widescreen Garmin, rather than take it apart again and put another battery in it, I got rid of it on Craigslist and now just use my iPhone 5 when I need nav.Now to this particular mount, a couple of things:First, the suction cup material is the best I've seen. It sucks on to the textured dash of my car and stays for weeks at a time in summer heat. Not bad. I'd never seen a suction cup that could adhere to a textured dash. Big points for this mount.Next, the magnet head: the rubberized finish provides enough friction to keep my device still under almost all circumstances. The magnet is powerful and the included metal inserts work wonderfully on my inexpensive slim cases--they give you a little thin round one you just drop in between your phone and the case that is so thin you don't even notice it, but it sticks tight right through the case. I used one of the adhesive ones on the outside of an extra Ringke Slim case because it is black and the colors match. Now THAT one holds tight even when you hit a crashing pothole.Finally the swivel mount: the screw-tight ball and socket mechanism of this head is a cut above the loose ball and socket of the Garmin mounts. Get the angle where you like it and lock it down. As a plus, you can loosen the head all the way and pop it off the base--and use any number of standard sized ball and socket mounts, right up to the fancy permanent-installation mounts that use the same size ball. Many people have one of those with a charging plug integrated for iPhone 4 etc. and are not  happy about the lightning cable obsoleting their car mounts. If you pop the old mount off the ball and pop this one on, you can run a lightning cable where the old power cord used to run and there you go--no-tool install as long as the cord you had can be accessed easily.A word about powerful magnets and the iPhone's function and reception: I have noticed no effect on either reception or the basic function of the iPhone. Apple confirms their product was designed to be impervious to magnetic interference--they even use magnets to do tricky things on the iPad. I think you have nothing to worry about with regards to the iMagnet in this regard.So if you are looking for the simplest possible no-tool installation of a nice phone mount in your car, this one is as awesome as the reviews here indicate. Most of us have tried multiple mounting systems with varying degrees of fail before we found this. Maybe you have too.If I could make one suggestion to iMagnet, it would be to market a line of slim cases with the steel mounting surface molded in, to provide positive magnetic lock without sticking a magnet plate onto a case. I use the little insert most of the time, but I have to say, having the plate on the outside really gives a positive mount that a lot of iMagnet users favor. Make cases that look just like everybody else's slim cases out there, for the most popular devices. Market cases and mounts as a bundle, and make a bundle.I'd be a buyer.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008IOQ3K6" id="B008IOQ3K6-review19" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-12:</strong> With my old phone I paid around $30 to get a car dock, but once I upgraded it didn't work.

I attached my mount and then tried to plug in my phone to the charging cord. Unfortunately, the plug for my phone is on the bottom, which causes the phone to push up on the mount. This caused the phone to become a little wobbly when I go over bumps. I just tilt my mount back a bit before I plug my phone in (shich I only do when I'm using it as a GPS).

I might have to find a flat surface round metal surface to stick onto my car with double sides tape to stick this mount onto to place it in a more visible location. A longer arm would have also solved this problem, or an extension that could be added.2) Because it requires a perfectly flat, porous free surface to stick to my car offers very few places to put this mount as most the surfaces are porous.3) It prefers to keep the phone in a portrait view, my preference is landscape (of course part of this problem may be due to the extended battery.4) Because it's a magnet the phone move in position and may not stay in the same position you put it as you make turns or hit bumps, though it doesn't fall off.Overall, I had better hopes for this I'm sure for the right phones with the right car with better mounting locations this would be a better mount for those people.

I have a Subaru Forester and an iPhone 4S. Most importantly, I have a case for the iPhone that I like a lot and which has just enough play in the case to let me slip in one of the slim magnetic panels supplied with the iMagnet cradle-less phone mount. A bit of duct tape holds the magnetic panel inside the back of my iPhone case. So ... presto! ... when I hold the iPhone 4s to the mount, it snaps to connect with a small THUNK. I can rotate the phone, or even adjust the mount. The mount is fastened securely to the top of the center storage compartment door on my Forester's dashboard.Most of the time, I use GPS maps in my phone: mostly the terrific &#34;Waze&#34; app now owned by Google, or Google Maps, or occasionally Apple Maps. But there are times when I still like to use my Garmin GPS unit ... but it weighs too much to attach to the iMagnet mount, so I have to install the Garmin's own suction-cup mount to my windshield on these occasions. (I often use the Garmin if I'm in rural areas with poor cellular connections, which makes the iPhone's GPS apps non-functional; the phone uses GPS top identify its location but needs cellular connections to bring in the mapping imagery.)If I purchase another iMagnet mount, I'd buy one large enough to handle my large GS unit. If you're thinking of using a full-size GPS unit, or maybe a small tablet such as an iPad Mini or even a full-sized iPad, you might want to find a larger mount.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008IOQ3K6" id="B008IOQ3K6-review27" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-01:</strong> The mount I have been waiting for someone to develop is here!

I was able to unscrew the plastic nut and remove the magnet from this mount and put it on another with a longer arm.The magnet works great.  It's seemingly rather powerful, pulling in the metal plates with a good bit of force, but not so much that you have trouble dislodging from the magnet.  The magnet also has a bit of a smooth, silky, rubberized coating, so there's not a loud snap or a worry of scratching.To get your phone to stick to the magnet, you have two options.  The first, which I use, is a round metal disk that you place between your phone and your case (thus, this method requires a case).  The disk is about the thickness of maybe 5 sheets of paper.  The second option is a pair of rectangular metal pieces with rounded corners that have adhesive pads on the back.  You can place these between a phone and case or adhere them to the back of a phone or case.  All of the metal is nicely machined and has no rough or sharp edges.In my case, I use this mount with a Galaxy S4 in an Urban Armor Gear case.  I have the round disk between my phone and case, which does interfere somewhat with NFC, but there's enough of the battery exposed that I definitely still can use NFC.  I just have to be aware of where NFC works on my phone.The case I have is relatively slick, being hard plastic, and it does allow my phone to rotate very easily on the magnet.  This can be mildly annoying, but is also kind of nice at times.The bottom line, though, is that the convenience of just stepping into my car, popping the phone on and then popping it off as I get out is magnificent.  Pairing this mount with Bluetooth in your car gives the absolute best experience.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008IOQ3K6" id="B008IOQ3K6-review31" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-18:</strong> Simply amazing.

I also cleaned my dash and used rubbing alcohol to remove any residue and let it dry. After all was dry, I attached it to my dash and left it overnight. By the next morning, it had fallen over without anything attached to it. So I went through the process again two more times with the result being the same - after a few minutes, it falls over even with nothing attached to the magnet.

I did watch the video review by a dude with a similar phone (might have been an S4, not sure). But he used it without a case, placing the steel plate between the battery and the phone back. I use a case and holster. So I wasn't sure if the magnet would have enough gumption to hold the phone with the plate between the phone and the case (my case has a built in kickstand on the back, which I never use). I figured if it didn't hold I'd just attach the adhesive side to the back of the case. Not an optimal solution, but it would have been worth a try.As it turns out, the magnet held just fine with the plate between the phone and case. I tried it in my work van yesterday afternoon and the morning. No movement at all with the phone on the magnet at highway speeds and on bumpy secondary roads. I was impressed.I removed one star due to the lack of movement of the ball mount. in my ford van the dash slopes away fairly sharply, and I couldn't quite get the phone at the angle I wanted when mounted to the dash as far forward as possible. Mounting on the windshield would put the phone too far away. I think of the ball mount collar was slightly lower profile it would have been fine.I'll probably end up getting another one so I have one in my car and one in my work van.Update: I used this in my car yesterday evening, a Toyota Matrix. The dash doesn't have a lot of flat spaces, but my current cradle sticks fine to the dashboard (it's a similar style silicon suction cup, the sticky kind). I had trouble getting the iMagnet suction cup to stick to the dash. Fell off in the middle of driving. The problem is, I have to have the suction cup fairly close to the front edge of the dashboard so I can plug in the phone charger when the phone is in portrait mode. I'm still fiddling with it to get it to work. I'll probably have to attach a plastic plate to the dash with adhesive-backed Velcro so the suction cup will have a flat surface to attach to.My suggestions to the manufacturer:1) Give the ball mount more freedom of movement, as mentioned above.2) Make the neck stem longer, and adjustable, so the suction cup can be place away from the edge of the dashboard, but the phone can still be mounted forward of the edge of the dash (Hopefully that makes sense). For the price, one would expect more adjustability.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008IOQ3K6" id="B008IOQ3K6-review40" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-11:</strong> Maybe it is just my car but it did not fit any where lose so it was far way for me to reach and view it.

The suction cup is great.  The first one has been in my car for almost 3 weeks and is still holding strong.

The timing was also perfect because we were about to start almost a 2k mile road trip visiting family for the holidays.So testing it out before leaving, on my otterbox defender encased Galaxy S3 - I tried using the circular metal piece and it worked, however using the longer rectangular one provided a more stable connection to the mount.  I was able to successfully use the phone both horizontally and vertically on the mount with no issues of falling off.My wife has an iphone 5s with an otterbox commuter case.  At first I tried the circular metal plate, and it worked however the phone wasn't centered on the mount - even though I put the metal plate in the center of the case.  So when I rotated the phone horizontally, it would fall off the mount.  Looking into the issue, it seems the otterbox case wasnt quite tight enough to hold the circular metal plate in place centered on the phone.  A quick, little piece of scotch tape on the metal peice on the back of the silicone inner layer of the case, and now the phone sits perfect on the mount.After traveling close to 2k miles, neither phone fell off ever.  Not only interstate travel, but also dirt / mountainous roads proved to be no issues at all.  The mount stayed on securely as well, I have not had to adjust / touch it since originally mounting it to the dash.  I used the phones' GPS / mapping almost exclusively the entire trip and even when touching the screen was no issue, neither phone fell, moved or shifted.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008IOQ3K6" id="B008IOQ3K6-review44" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-13:</strong> This was the best car holster I have bought.

They provide a few steel plates to attach to your phone or its case. The large rectangular plate's strong adhesive bonded it securely to the exterior of my iPhone 5's hard-rubber Splash case. (Don't try putting the plate inside your case: the magnetic attraction will not be sufficient to hold the phone securely.)The mount's circular magnet is surprisingly powerful. When attached, my iPhone isn't going anywhere under braking, turning, or acceleration. And tapping, swiping or other touch-screen shenanigans don't fluster the phone's magnetic anchoring either.I continue to be skeptical about the "3M Silicon" dashboard suction cup/adhesive attachment solution. They claim that if removed the surface will regain its stickiness with only a quick wash, but when I peeled back the cover, I perceived a layer of adhesive over top of that silicon, and when that's gone it's never coming back. Maybe that's why they make a big deal out of installing it correctly the first time.The weasel wording the manufacturer uses to cover their butts in the instructions did not enhance my confidence. They caution against installing the mount on uneven surfaces (like my dashboard's pebbled dash, perhaps?). And, the surface you install it on should never be exposed to hot sun! Like, uh, my dashboard? Where else am I going to install the thing? (Windshield mounting is illegal in California.)In my cool underground parking area I gave a section of my dashboard a good scrub and a thorough dry, then installed the mount exactly as instructed. Perfection. Under optimal conditions, using the original adhesive, the mount is solidly planted on my dash. Now instead of fumbling with my phone to see Google Maps, the securely mounted (vertically or horizontally) iPhone now displays my route in a far safer manner. Looks cool, too!SEVERAL MONTHS LATER: The adhesive failed only once, while I was driving in California's Central Valley on a hot (100+) summer day. The weight of the phone was pulling the gradually-unsticking mount from its moorings. So I removed the phone and re-planted the mount. By the next morning it was as solid as when I first installed it.And since then it's been a fixture in my elderly Jaguar sedan. But sadly, after ordering a second iMagnet for my partner's BMW, I was to discover its sensitivity to surfaces. For some reason, the new iMagnet never "took" to the BMW's dashboard surface, and so it could not be relied upon to hold its assigned iPhone4.Make of it what you will. Perhaps one of those disc-shaped mounting plates will secure the iMagnet to the BMW. The thing is so convenient and functional, going to the trouble will probably be worth the effort.Time will tell. Stay tuned.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008IOQ3K6" id="B008IOQ3K6-review50" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-11:</strong> wish this just came with the magnet and doublesided tape, then I could really put it anywhere in the care.

Form, function, fabulous.  The &#34;Sticky&#34; suction cup works great up to about 20+ sticks, then the coating begins to wear off, leave residue, etc.  I got around this by using it as a semi-permanent fixture, suctioned to the back of my Nexus 7, using the magnets to stick the device to whatever I need.  I stuck one of the 3M adhesive metal plates on my desk just in front of the keyboard and it works great.  It also sticks very nicely to the top of the convection oven in the kitchen for use while cooking and as a bonus, the magnet allows me to stick it to the arm rest on my metal-frame patio furniture on the pool deck for easy use while sitting outside watching the 42' on the pool deck.  Using the suction cup on the device also gives me a nice handle while holding the device, resting comfortably, securely in my finger-webbing (for lack of a better term) where my pointer and middle fingers meet.  I can even join the magnet end(s) to stick to the wife's iMagnet which is used as designed in her car, magnet up/out.  The unit also props itself up as a conventional tablet stand would when resting on the coffee table, night stand, etc.  Worth mention, when using as a prop the most ideal side of the Nexus 7 (landscape) only allows for a slightly less than 90 degree angle when mounted at plumb-center.  In this case I usually will stick the magnet to the back of my Galaxy S4 and use that as the stand base (with screen protector and clean surface).  This also has the added effect of allowing me to pick up the magnetically connected devices and view / use the phone by simply flipping the contraption over. Amazing.Cons: The item would be near perfect, in my view, if:1- The magnet section was slightly smaller.  This would affect the stability of the system when in use with a larger product such as the Nexus 7 I use it with, but if possible, perhaps with a stronger magnet, this would allow the tablet to decrease the near-90-degree angle when using it to prop up the tablet as I use it.  Flipping the Nexus 7 over does work and place it at a more comfortable angle, closer to 45 degrees, but then often depresses the power button if fiddled with.2- The ball joint allowed for slightly more flexibility with a section notched out of one side @ 90 degrees. This would allow the magnet to be mounted flush (think, top of metal chair arm) while allowing the suction arm attachment to pivot 90 into the notched section for portrait view while hanging off of the side of the chair arm (or similar application).I love this product overall and my &#34;Cons&#34; amount to hair-splitting.  When combined with my LG Bluetooth headset the combo is unstoppable!  Buy this product.  You too will love it!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008IOQ3K6" id="B008IOQ3K6-review52" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-07:</strong> I only read the one-star ratings before buying to see what people didn't like.

Unfortunately I have had 2 issues - one on the device itself and one with it's compatibility with my phone case - so I have not yet been able to actually use the mount in my car. I have, however, played with it and *attempted* to mount it in my car. (see update)The head is actually very easy to move. Some of the reviews said that it was difficult - I wonder if they noticed the collar that you twist to loosen the head and allow it to move? That collar allows articulation while making sure the whole thing is very secure (I know, personally, that a mount that's always falling over is particularly annoying.)Unlike what another review mentioned, the suction cup was NOT able to stick to the textured dash of my vehicle - it stuck for about an hour and then fell off (and it was neither a particularly hot nor cold day). The texture is that lightly wrinkled faux leather-looking plastic. Attaching to the glass is not an option - not only is the slope of my windshield dramatic enough to require me to stick this thing dead center, but it is actually illegal in my state to mount anything to the windshield and block line-of-sight of the driver. So while this *does* stick to glass very well, I can't use it there! :( I have bought a console disk to put on my dash, theArkon AP036 70 mm Console Attachment Diskwhich fits the iMagnet perfectly and has had no adhesion issues thus far (it's been a few months, but granted it's the middle of what's turned out to be a very cold winter).The other issue was the metal plates. They are not totally compatible with the 2-part Otterbox Commuter case. Why? Otterbox designed the outer hard shell with a circle of raised plastic dead center, so I can't fit either the square or circle plates toward the top without  either being off-center or covering the camera. I could put them on the bottom, and simply turn on screen rotation when I mount the phone... but that's a tad obnoxious. I could also put the plate between the soft part of the case and the phone itself, but that makes the connection between magnet and plate weaker. This *is* more of an issue with the case than the mount, but I think it's worth mentioning so that others are aware of the possible issue with their cases.Update: I did end up placing the plate under both layers of the Commuter case - didn't want to do that originally since I was afraid of scratches and it weakens the magnetic connection a bit - and orienting the plate vertically. The phone still attaches just fine but the slightly weaker connection means that it does start rotating from the road vibration if it's not centered absolutely perfectly - whereas in a thinner case the connection was plenty strong to prevent that. If it's allowed to bounce too far, my phone has fallen off a couple of times. Again, this is more a case issue than the mount itself.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008IOQ3K6" id="B008IOQ3K6-review62" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-29:</strong> I wasn't sure when I bought it that it would work as advertised, but they were right.

The less moving parts, the less chance of something failing or breaking. I haven't had it more than a day so I can't speak to it's longevity but the iMagnet company includes a website where you can register the product for a 1 year warranty. That's, IMO, a hidden plus; A company willing to stand by their product.What I didn't see in previous reviews (although I admittedly didn't go through all of them) is a better description on the selection of metallic plates that they provide. There are 2 rectangular ones with 3M adhesive and a smaller, thinner circular disk which has no adhesive which is PERFECT for ultra slim/minimalist cases that have little tolerance for fitting anything between the case and the phone. I've got an iPhone 4 with the eLago SF slim case and I'm still able to get a snap-tight fit  AND it still doesn't compromise the magnetic strength of the system itself. It's possible it might vary based on the material the case is made out of but with how strong the magnet is as long as the material is thin enough it shouldn't be an issue.What would have made this product a full 5 stars was if they provided a smooth disk similar to what's provided with the Arkon product ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ELOOZO/ref=oh_details_o09_s00_i01 ). $25 is a bit steep but worth it for a good product that will last, especially when it comes to smartphone accessories.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008IOQ3K6" id="B008IOQ3K6-review68" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-10:</strong> really love how i dont need to mess around with a bulky cell car mount when needing to take the phone out of the holding unit on most all other car mounts... this one really is amazingly well designed. the sticky bottom suction cup is great, i wasnt expecting it to be so strong and resuable. the circle magnet that comes with the pack (along with 2 big square magnets for a case) is really sweet. what i did was put it inside my Galaxy 3 back cover, i just placed it on the battery and closed it up... no extra case required. i know they dont tell you to do so but if you have an S3 I suggest you try it out. hands down the best car mount on the market to date, plus you cant beat amazons prices</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008IOQ3K6" id="B008IOQ3K6-review69" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-08:</strong> I guess the only silly reason I didn't give it five stars is the name--but they are appealing to the Apple herd so.....

The metal disc fits right under the battery cover for a clean install. A dab of superglue keeps it in place.It also includes 2 metal plates with adhesive backing for installing under a phone case or to the back of the phone. The rubber coating prevents scratches to the phone and keeps it from sliding off. There are minimal vibrations when driving over bumpy roads.I used to have an Arkon mount and had to clamp and unclamp my phone every time. Now there's no more messing with clamps!

In fact it is not strong enough to hold my S4 securely in its case.It sticks, but then starts to tilt - one way then the other, after driving a while. It seems the circular shape for the magnet was a bad choice.So I end up having to correct the orientation a number of times during any drive.With a rectangular one you could assure it stays in one orientation - which is kind of essential for this application.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008IOQ3K6" id="B008IOQ3K6-review76" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-01:</strong> Love, love, love this mount!  It's fiddle-free; you just bring the phone close enough and you feel the pull of the magnet.  I use a Moshi iGlaze case for my iPhone 5; the metal disc (that comes with the mount) you insert between the phone and the case makes the case fit slightly less than perfect--but it's worth the incredible ease of using the mount.  So note that while there's a trade-off, considering all the different pain-in-the-neck configurations of mounts and cases, this one works perfectly for me.Also note that I use this in my convertible and attach the mount to my windshield; I have not had any issues with the mount coming unattached from the windshield or the phone being demagnetised as a I drive at freeway speeds.  And with the car-mount attached to the windshield almost always with the top-down, I have not had any issues with it being removed by a would-be thief (yet).  I would HIGHLY recommend this mount for anyone looking for something to holster their phone on the dash.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008IOQ3K6" id="B008IOQ3K6-review77" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-09:</strong> I have been using this product for several months, over 12.. I still like it a lot. I still use a thin case and I have glued the metal plate to the inside of my case. I have never had the phone release, never. I have never hand the suction release from the glass.  This holder is awesome. It does not effect my phone at all.  People are amazed when they see it. It is so easy to use, it holds my phone extremely well. I really like this holder.  The sticky paste stays with the rubber suction cup and time and time again when I change from rental car to rental the holder has not failed. It looks great, with and without the phone.Original messageI like this a lot.  Works great and holds my phone.  I have a thin case and it performs well.  It is so nice to place and remove the phone with only one hand.  Why only four stars?  I do not like the suction cup as much.  I travel a lot, so I need to always move the mount from rental car to rental car.  Mounts I have used in the past use a silicone clear rubber suction pad that works well.  This company uses a black silicone with a sticky surface.  I place it on the windshield and it holds very well.  When I go to remove the mount it is a bit of a challenge.  It is very sticky.  I was able to remove it, I hope the sticky paste does not come off too soon.  I did notice some did come off while I was attempting to remove the mount.  I did keep the wax tape so I can place it back on the suction cup in between rentals.  It did not leave any marks on the window.  This may not be a big deal, only time will tell.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008IOQ3K6" id="B008IOQ3K6-review78" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-21:</strong> After trying other brands, took the plunge on the iMagnet based on positive comments and ratings.  Attaches firmly to my textured vinyl dash, and the magnet grabs my Galaxy Note 2 with no movement while driving.  I also really like the small height profile of the mount, minimizing field of view obstructions.  This was close to a last resort, since my windshield rakes sharply, and a CD mount would obscure center controls or the nav screen.  Hoping this continues to perform flawlessly!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008IOQ3K6" id="B008IOQ3K6-review79" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-09:</strong> This is a very good mount.

MAGNETS!Worked right out of the box. I bought this to replace one that was a &#34;clip&#34; style, and had a couple moving parts.Pros:- no moving parts.- has 2 other metal pieces, with adhesive, to help if the &#34;coin&#34; one doesn't work.- VERY strong magnet. I was surprised at how strong it is.Cons:- there's a sticky rubber material on the bottom of the suction cup. While this increases the grip, it makes it really hard to remove the set-up. Basically, you should have a spot already picked. Once it's on you won't be able to move it easily.- If I didn't have a case on the phone I couldn't use the product.

However, if you don't have a smooth phone case, or the phone is bulky (e.g. Galaxy Note) and on top of that it's also in a case, the magnet doesn't seem to be strong enough. Good thing there are two metal pads included, so you can experiment with yours. 99% of the phones will be absolutely fine.It's such a pleasure to be able to simply put the phone ON it and then just as simply take it OFF it.You may end up doing that about 10 times in a row just because it's fun...</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008IOQ3K6" id="B008IOQ3K6-review82" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-18:</strong> This is a pleasure to use! My previous phone car mount was designed to physically snap onto my old iphone and hold it in place by friction. I was always concerned that the friction points would scuff, which they eventually did. It was also awkward to snap the phone in and out of the cradle, having to use one hand to hold the phone and one to release the catch. The soft rubber covered magnetic mount design of this one is terrific! It's so elegant to simply put your phone near the mount and it magically snaps in place. The magnet is fairly strong, no worries running over bumps. My town has some atrocious railroad tracks crossings and this mount passed with flying colors. The magnet doesn't hold so tight where you feel like you'll destroy your dash trying to disengage the phone however. One decent tug and the phone pops right off. Ingenious. Works perfectly for me. The mount requires a metal disc or panel (included) to be either inserted or stuck with adhesive between the phone and a case (not included). I preferred not to use a phone case so I unscrewed the back cover of my iPhone 4S and placed the metal disc between the battery and the back cover. Works great and does not seem to degrade the signal strength of the phone or GPS signal.The real amazing feature for me is the mount that attaches to your dash. It is super-duper solid! There are two methods of attachment, by adhesive and mechanical suction cup. The mounting disc is super-sticky. It's not an adhesive glue coating, but appears to be made of an adhesive rubbery material that holds firmly to a surface, but won't separate and pull apart like a glued surface would. It reminds me of those sticky rubber elastic hands I used to get out of the gumball machines as a kid only much, much stickier. The second aspect of the mounting device is a mechanical suction cup that locks the mount into place. Once you have stuck the mount into place you push down a lever which engages the suction cup. You hear a satisfying "snap" and the mount is firmly locked down. When mounted to a fairly smooth surface this thing simply does not move. My old mount actually was fastened under the dash with screws and this one feels as solid without having to find a hidden spot under the dash or worrying about damaging the dash if it is used in an open location.Although the attachment to the dash feels super solid, it does enable you to easily disengage the mount and move it to another location. Simply pull up the lever to disengage the suction and peel up the adhesive base to remove it from the dash. It's cool to think this could outlast my current car, that I can take it wherever I go and also use it with multiple devices.Awesome, awesome, awesome.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008IOQ3K6" id="B008IOQ3K6-review83" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-07:</strong> I was looking for something that wouldn't fall off my dash ever few days and would actually hold my phone and this works perfect.  Since I didn't want to mount the metal magnet piece directly to my iPhone, I attached it to my carrying case instead and it hold nice and secure without me worrying that if I hit a good bump it would fall off, it doesn't.  Love it and would recommend this one to anybody.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008IOQ3K6" id="B008IOQ3K6-review84" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-27:</strong> I use a LifeProof case on my iPhone.  I use my iPhone as my GPS.  I bought a LifeProof adapter so I could use my GoPro mounts to mount my iPhone to the dashboard. The problem with the LifeProof adapter is you can not have the power adapter while in the LifeProof clip.  Problem was solved by this iMagnet.  I have had the iMagnet attached to my dashboard for 2 weeks with no problems. Placing the metal plate on the pack of my LifeProof case holds firmly. Now I can have a secure GPS on my dash and have it charging at the same time.  It is also great using it with more phones.

I know that sounds crazy specific, but when navigating around NYC and NJ without local knowlegde, you don't want your GPS/phone floating around on the passenger seat or dash board. When not in the car, I use it mounted to my home office desk.I was most skeptical about the quality of the magnet and thus, the hold. This unit is rock solid, and the on/off tension of the magnet is perfect - not too strong, not too weak. The silicone suction is much better than any other mount I've used from Garmin and others. It also works well on more than just glass or glass-like smooth surfaces. You just place one of the paper thin metal pieces between your phone and case (I don't use the 3M peel/stick provided), and it works like a charm. A real bargain at $20-25.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008IOQ3K6" id="B008IOQ3K6-review86" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-05:</strong> Regardless of what they say, the suction did not stick on the leather dash board.

The combination of these 2 methods allow this mount to hold very securely to a number of surfaces. I mounted this to the faux wood trim in my 2014 VW Passat, just to the right of nav screen. It's doing very well there, out of the way of the radio operation but still extremely available for screen interactions with the phone.This mount provides a ball mounted head that allows a reasonable range of movement for either the top of the dashboard or the windshield. The short arm doesn't move so it may not be ideal for all locations you might prefer. I stuck the mount sideways on the dash trim so it provided proper viewing of my Samsung Note 3 from the driver's seat and that is working out well for me. It's mounted on a vertical surface, as opposed to a horizontal surface or the windshield.There are many similar designs of this magnetic mount phone holder from different companies, although all of them seem extremely similar. We got a CD slot mount for my wife, which she really likes for her Samsung S3. In my Passat that same CD mount works, but blocks the dashboard clock, so this worked better since I could find a better location for the phone.So far I'm very happy with the mount.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008IOQ3K6" id="B008IOQ3K6-review90" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-22:</strong> i was looking for a cradle mount for my dash and i was turned off by the idea of having to use two hands to dock my phone or docks not working with cases. i finally found this. you will not regret buying this thing. the person who invented this is a genius. in the package you get the mount itself, as shown in the items main picture. with it comes three magnets that you attach to your phone or case. one is a circular one without adhesive on either side. the other two are larger and rectangular with adhesive on one side so you can stick it to your phone/case. i use the circular one and keep it in between my phone and my case so that no one can tell its there and when i get in the car i just slap it on the mount and drive. the magnet is stronger than most would assume but if you have a thick case and put the magnet inside it, i think you will be disappointed.overall i just have two minor complaints:1. i think they should sell magnets of different shapes and colors that way they aren't as ugly on your case.2. the mount does not adjust height wise.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008IOQ3K6" id="B008IOQ3K6-review91" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-02:</strong> Stability ratio wonderful for the first timeRaw material is good and beautiful probably priced a little high because the idea is simple, but the goods excellent and I intend to buy another one for my friend ..

I mean, a magnet next to your phone? Didn't it used to be that any magnet within like 10 feet of a computer would wreck and erase its hard drive?! So needless to say, I was a bit nervous.Secondly, I was nervous that the magnet itself wouldn't be strong enough, and my HTC One would constantly be falling off.Well, I'm very happy to say that this has outperformed my expectations, and I am so pleasantly surprised with how easy it is to use. I only used the round no adhesive magnet (stuck between the case and the phone), and it keeps my rather large HTC One on with no problem whatsoever. I have a sort of old stick shift, and at high speeds or when quick shifting it isn't exactly a smooth ride...but this mount has stayed on both the dash, and kept my phone attached to it, with no problems at all.It's only been a week with it, but I have to tell you, every time I simply reach up and let my phone get sucked to the mount or I quickly grab it off to use it in my hand...I feel an intense level of satisfaction. The magnet mounting is just simply brilliant. I can't believe it. Why would anyone ever want anything else? Who wants to clip things in?I will update in a month or so to see where things are.I also got the Tech Armor Anti-Glare screens, and the mediabridge 3.5mm aux cable to augment my car driving experience, and so far I am very pleased with both of those. Updates as things develop!**Update**It's only been a few days or maybe a week, but I just wanted to update the situation because I did run into a problem. Not with the dock exactly, but with a car charger I purchased. I didn't realize the car charger I ordered had a curly slinky cable, and so when I used it with this dock, the cord pulled too much and my phone would spin until it was lopsided. I tried stretching the cable, I tried attempting to hook the cable onto something higher up so that it wouldn't pull as much, and while I got some improvements...the phone still moved. As far as I'm concerned, the dock is still incredible. I returned the charger and I'm waiting on a charger that has a straight cable which I know won't be a problem. My aux cable has no affect on the phone at all (cause it is held quite solidly).**Update 6/6/14**Well, at this point it has been about 3/4 of a year, and man this thing is still going strong. It lasted me a cross country trip, where it FINALLY became unstuck only twice, but my girlfriend grabbed it and stuck it right back in place and it was solid. The second time it fell off was over two months ago now. We now live in Las Vegas, where the temperatures regularly get up to 100 and over, and this little guy hasn't fallen off at all here. I got a different phone (Switched back to iPhone), and I put the magnet in my new case, and use that phone with it no problem!

I use it on the small window on my driver side and it works great. It did not work on my Trident phone case, but it worked well on my snap on case and my Otter Box Defender case. I would recommend this product to anyone because it is really great when going from one car to another that has the exact same mount. Unlike the CD mount that blocks off part of the media control, this can go on the window without blocking my vision or controls. I would recommend getting one for every car. The metal plates that it comes with holds really strong too. I would recommend using the circle metal plate on phones that have removable batteries because it is thinner. When using it with a double or triple layered case, put it on the out most layer. The mount did not work with my Trident case because of the back design, which creates a large gap between the magnet and metal plate. I threw out my Grip and Go because it did not hold up as well as the iMagnet.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008IOQ3K6" id="B008IOQ3K6-review104" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-04:</strong> I really didn't know what to expect when getting this...I've always avoided magnets and electronics.However, after buying 3 other clamp types of holder for my Lumia 920...and the endless frustration of clamping, unclamping, etc...I decided to give this a shot.It is great!I have the metal disk between the phone and the case I have it in...and it is so easy to use.I hit lots of pot holes in Chicago, and this never dropped my phone.I have also used it on a Nexus 7 as well.The only reason I marked it down a star was that it interferes with my built-in wireless QI charging...but that is a small price to pay.It has not caused any issues with the GPS navigation of the phone or the tablet.This is a great product, and worth the relatively low price.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008IOQ3K6" id="B008IOQ3K6-review105" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-16:</strong> This thing is simply amazing!

First off -- it looks really cheap. I know that may not mean a lot but when you start putting the "I" in front of the things the expectation is there that it is going to look nice - but this thing is pretty hideous -- from the rubber mount surface to the awful logo. The other issue is that it is not really adjustable-- the end of the mount moves on a ball joint but that's it-- the angle / curve of the mount is fixed -- with limited space to mount this presents a problem  -- just my two cents</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008IOQ3K6" id="B008IOQ3K6-review109" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-05:</strong> Why didn't anyone think of this beforehand.

If you use this with a phone that is not encased with an extra shell or a cover, it works pretty well. Unfortunately, if you have a bumper or case or shell (I use a Spigen case), that little extra thickness may increase the distance between a plate inside and the magnet and weaken the strength enough to let the phone slip, especially if you have a heavy phone like a Note 3. You may need to mount the plate on the outside of your extra case (making for an ugly protrusion) for a direct contact between the plate and the magnet. The neck is also very short so if you have a large phone, like a Note 3 you may need to position it closer to the bottom or top to avoid hitting the surface or angle it away. The plate also adds a bit of weight to your phone.If you are using a phone as is, without an extra case, and it is not a large phone, it should work well. It works sufficiently for a Note3 but I would not recommend it for a Note3.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008IOQ3K6" id="B008IOQ3K6-review114" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-08:</strong> I Love it.The magnet is strong enough to hold through my case.

It is a beautiful design and idea, but that is where the admiration for this product ends. The lack of a closure mechanism for this case meMs you will need to either deal with the flap swinging around or invest in the Spigen closure solution (which is quite effective and elegant). On top of that additional investment you will need to purchase a high quality GLASS screen protector in order to absorb the constant abuse that the transistion area on the inside flap of this case (the leather material running into the plastic window) will cause to the devices screen. This wear and tear WILL result in permanent degradation of the oleophobic coating and create PERMENANT lines on the Note 3s screen. For this product to be a Samsung genuine product THIS IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE!!!! Insult to injury with this product is that you will have to BEG Samsung to make repairs to the device once the damage caused by their OEM product causes to your device. Completely UNACCEPTABLE!!!!I planned on using a glass screen protector with my device anyway, and wanted the Spigen magnetic closure to add a bit of flash to this case anyway, so that being said, I am happy with my setup, but buyer beware of this additional purchases that will be needed in order to maintain the prestine condition of your device.If only Samsung put as much thought and effort into the design of this product as they did with the Note 3 this may well have been a home run, unfortunately this is a FOUL BALL!

I'm glad I finally decided to bite the bullet and order this case. Real functionality and Style. Couple that with the discount you can get this case for on Amazon and it's a done deal. What are you waiting for? You won't regret it. I've gone through several different cases, looking for &#34;the one&#34;. Heh. Almost every case I've tried adds too much bulk to the phone, even the &#34;slim/super slim&#34; ones. This case, however, cheats... somewhat. LOL. It's technically not a &#34;case&#34;, but a replacement battery cover that has the front cover attached to it. When you open the cover, the phone wakes up. When you close it, it goes to sleep. Simple, right? So simple, but oh so convenient. Never again will you fumble to unlock your screen to receive a call. Actually, you don't even need to open the cover. Just swipe the call button on the outer window. Viola! Call answered. No need to open the cover to continue your phone call either, due to the PERFECTLY aligned earpiece cutout. The stitching around the edges of this item are real. It's actually stitched leather.. wow. (Maybe it's just really, really good imitation leather...But, nonetheless... real stitching!) One thing I suggest is to get an unused screen protector, cut it out to the dimensions of the outer window, and apply. Saves you the worry of thinking about scratching the outer window. If this one breaks/falls apart, I'd definitely get another one.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F3580BI" id="B00F3580BI-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-09:</strong> When I went looking for a new cover for my phone, I only considered the element of protection. I considered the color. I considered the style. Little did I realize that I could also include additional functionality for the device itself. I chose the Samsung Note 3 Folio and was pleasantly surprised. It fit like the proverbial glove in its replacement for the back cover of the phone. The display for the front cover allowed me to view different aspects of notifications, answer the phone, use the camera, place music and of course use the s-pen. It was about forty dollars but was worth every cent. A truly useful and elegant solution that was over and above my original desires.

People are amazed at the huge window on the case. The fake leathery feel of the case feels nice. This OEM product feels OEM and it just attaches to the back of the phone. You just replace your old battery cover with this one. The S-View window is nice for checking notifications and accessing short cuts like music and S-Note. The one problem I have is that the flaps stays open and does not stay close sometimes depending on the angle you hold it. The folio style makes it difficult to do one-handed stuff and is annoying when you just want to stay on your phone for games.

It is faux leather with real stitching for a more classy and professional look.It does add a little bulk and weight to the device. It sometimes gets annoying if you leave the flap turned back for extended periods it sometimes won't stay closed afterwards unless you leave it laying facedown to counteract it.

That's a video game I coulda bought. That's IS NOT the reason I'm giving this case 3 stars. I've had the phone since day 1. Picked this case up 3 weeks ago. At first I was really excited cause I thought the features were cool. My mind changed after a week. There should be an option for you to read your text without opening the cover. What's the point of seeing that I have a message or call without having the option to dial back? Some people might think that's nit picking but without the case, a sentence of text message show up for you to read. At first I thought the music playing option without opening your phone was cool but I was fooled. It's cool to see the album artwork show but you can only select music in that playlist or album. So what's the problem you ask? All of these things can be enhanced with more options but there is none. Also on my T-Mobile Note 3, it happens quite often where I would close my phone and 'Pick the Color' of the S-View screen pops up after I set it a million times.

The case does have a lot of minor downsides that make the case less convenient/functional.  If you're looking for a good looking case, I would highly recommend this case.  If you're looking for something more functional, you may want to look elsewhere.Note: Some reviews say that the cover doesn't stay closed after opening it, but if you lave the phone flat, the case will close all the way within a few seconds.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F3580BI" id="B00F3580BI-review32" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-12:</strong> Excellent quality.

I found this case online, loved the look and read all the raving reviews. It finally arrived today and I am so thrilled. I think the phone itself is a sexy device and this case only compliments it instead of hiding the original style/design. It is not bulky at all which was welcome after using the other case I had purchased. Another bonus is that it has all the proper cut-outs for the mic's for noise canceling and the video camera.And lastly, I was always accidentally hitting/bumping the vol. up/down buttons on the side of the phone and it would adjust ringer volume. Due to the way this case is made, it is much sturdier in that spot and it no longer happens. Yay!

For $6.99 it is a great case.  It barely adds any bulk on to the phone, and all the holes for the camera, speakers, ports etc are perfect in size.  Overall had this case a couple days and am very pleased with it.  This is the third case I have tried for the phone and this one is by far the best.  Other cases I have tried had small holes for charging etc and ended up being really annoying.  This case was great easy on the eye, slim, and great glossy design for the back which keeps it very similar to the HTC design.For the price, I definitely recommend this case, it feels like this case should be about $20 bucks but its only $7.  Buy it and don't look back.P.S. The cleaning cloth that came with it sucks, left lint all over my screen of my phone but still 5 stars since the review is for the case and not the extra addon in the cleaning cloth.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005A2UR4W" id="B005A2UR4W-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-30:</strong> It's a good product, covers the phone nicely and has cut out holes for all the required connections and antennas.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005A2UR4W" id="B005A2UR4W-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-09-23:</strong> I knew I wanted a cover, but was kinda bummed that I knew it would cover the signature design cue of the HTC Sensation: the back cover. It really is what makes the phone distinctive and attractive, in my mind. So, I tried one of those clear back covers, but the colored silicone edge of it separated from the clear back. Just didn't work. So, now what? Well, this case was, in my mind, an excellent compromise. It at least hints at the design cue with the two tone angle back. The photos that user Brian has posted are excellent and invaluable if you have any questions about how it fits and looks. I agree with Brian and other reviewers that the top part just above the earpiece is a bit odd, and it probably should cup over the top a little better to reach closer to the earpiece. But perhaps the thinking was that it would better to leave that area a little more clear of plastic so that when you held it up to your ear, the case wouldn't touch your ear so much? Just a theory. The fit of this case is excellent, as is the quality, especially for the price. The phone still feel sleek and slim and light. It really doesn't add a lot of bulk. The cloth, although a bonus, really isn't anything special, and does, as others have noted, give off fuzz.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005A2UR4W" id="B005A2UR4W-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-06-16:</strong> Great case for the price. I've used the Otterbox case for the Sensation and some plastic cases as well, but this one beats them all. This case actually "snugs" the phone, covering it tightly, and does it without over coverage. Other phone like the Otterbox are thick and have unnecessary skin.Also, this case has a premium feel to it. Makes you want to keep the case on the phone!

All I can say is that this cover is a great deal for the money. I used to have a hard, snap on cover and this one has outlasted it and protects my phone just as well as the hard cover. Heck, I was even thinking of getting one of those $30+ covers but I will probably be better off just getting some extra ones of these. Fits the phone dang near perfectly and doesn't get in the way of any of the ports. If this somehow had an optional belt clip add on accessory I would give it 5 stars. This, along with a top notch screen protector (the Skinomi one is exceptional) is all you will need to keep your phone in mint condition.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005A2UR4W" id="B005A2UR4W-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-08-12:</strong> Definitely this is the best skin as of now available in amazon for Sensation.

It tends to go on and off pretty easily. Nice material, doesn't slip very easily. The buttons all work well, but need a little more force than normal. The case covers the buttons, and the material seems raised so the buttons don't get pushed accidentally. The one problem that i did have with the case is that the headphones hole didn't quite line up. It was fine with most headphones, but my monster cable car (headphone) jack wouldn't sit and kept popping out. I modified the hole a bit and works fine now. The case does add a little bulk to the phone, but about the same as other cases.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005A2UR4W" id="B005A2UR4W-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-09:</strong> I like the style of this and it looks great on the BACK of the phone.

It looks beautiful, it feels good in the hand, it's got great grip, and most importantly, it protects all sides of the phone.I have dropped my phone on the ground (screen side down) and this case protected it just fine. It has a ridge on the screen side in case you drop or place your phone with the screen facing down.Obviously it doesn't have a screen protector, I made my own out of an iPad protector from Power Support USA (Best available screen protectors) so make sure you get one if you want full protection.Just keep in mind, the screen on the HTC Sensation 4G is slightly curved along the edges which makes it VERY difficult to get the screen protectors to sit perfectly flat on the edges unless they are slightly smaller than the actual viewable screen size.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005A2UR4W" id="B005A2UR4W-review24" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-08-23:</strong> This case is hands down the, best of its kind.Fits snugly and complements the phones curves and shape.By far is the best looking case,with all the correct holes for the phones flash,camera,speakers and mics.Great buy!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005A2UR4W" id="B005A2UR4W-review25" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-12-25:</strong> I love the price of the case. the feel and the hard piece in the back to help hold its Shape..

I noticed in other reviews they complained about how it's difficult to tap the screen or whatever. I didn't face that problem the screen was very easy to access, which surprised me considering the reviews. The case is in fact waterproof I tested it the moment I got it and it has survived a few drops. Which is perfect for me considering how clumsy I am and the case looks great. I didn't experience any problems with the part where you place your phone charger or headphones either. Maybe I was just one of the lucky ones. I am extremely satisfied with this case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BX3EGIA" id="B00BX3EGIA-review26" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-26:</strong> I ordered this case for my daughter's Samsung Galaxy S3 at the same time ordered a Otterbox waterproof case for my sons Iphone 5.THIS case is not the best quality.The colored edging of the case is the same thin plastic as the 'screen protector' for the phone.

What I like best is it will hold portrait and landscape many different size and types of devices. Most all of these were tested in this stand with their TPU thick covers on the device. And I tested this with several phones and also I tested this on several sixes of tablets:  a 7 inch tablet, 8 inch tablet and 10 inch.Below I list in the PROS my actual test findings and more info on this stand as to the features of it:PROS:+ Phones and MP3 players (large and small) I tested and  how this stand performed - First I tested my large Samsung Galaxy 5 MP3 Player with the TPU Cover on. Even at 1/2 inch thickness, this stand held my player in portrait and landscape SECURELY!Samsung Galaxy S4 with a thick silicone cover on it - fits fine. Samsung Galaxy Grand with TPU cover fits fine in portrait and landscape.+ Tablets - So I tested 3 Samsung Galaxy tablets: 1) Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 with TPU cover (thickness of 1/2 inch). This fit perfectly both landscape and portrait. Note that this particular tablet is very heavy (compared to Tab 3 line or iPads), and it fit very securely. 2) Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 with TPU cover (not as heavy or thick as the Tab 2 7.0), this tablet fit beautifully in the stand for portrait or landscape. 3) Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 (this is a very heavy and thick tablet). I do not have a TPU cover for this, so I placed it into the stand with no cover and it fit perfectly in portrait and in landscape. **If it can fit this bulky and heavy tablet, it can fit most any device with ease!+ Adjustments - There are FOUR total adjustments on this stand once you open it from the folded mode.1) Upright (tall) mode (for leaning the device more upright) - this is the top adjustment on the back of the stand -- be sure that you press this in the top groove to LOCK the stand's back for security.2) More flat mode (Lounge-chair mode for leaning the device at more of an angle backwards- This is when you want more of a backward angle when say you are watching a video, movie, this kind of thing. Be sure to lock in this on the bottom groove in the stand to make sure it is secure and stays in place.3) Device stand  standard mode - This is where you stand your phone or tablet. So in the regular mode you can really fit a thicker device in this stand and sometimes I use this. But when I have a thinner device such as a thin phone, I go to locking stand mode (below).4) Locking stand mode - I advise this one for phones! To secure this mode for your phone do this: Pull down the bottom part of the stand (the part where you place your phone) until you hear it make a snapping sound. Then place your phone into the stand. You will see right away if you look on the side view that this seems to hug the table better on the bottom and it grabs onto the phone better making it more secure. *Suggestion: Use this if you have a thinner phone. For me, I use this stand for my Galaxy Player 5 which is thick at 1/2 inch deep and so I use the standard mode on that.** Front standing modes: May I suggest that you try each one of the front device stand modes and see which one you prefer and which one works better on your phone.+ Charging my devices in this stand  (and using them at the same time) - For me I can easily charge my phones in portrait mode while in this stand (the Samsung phones and Samsung MP3 player). The 7 and 8 inch tablets I can also charge and use at the same time in this stand if they are in landscape mode. Yes, I was also able to charge my Tab 2 10.1 (in portrait mode) wonderfully and even got it to charge in landscape (turning it upside down).  Although this is not a docking station, I use it almost like it is because of the charging ability (it has a large open part at the bottom in which to insert your charging cable into the stand/device).+ Overall quality, design and portability- The quality I found very good. The design I love because of all the adjustments and best of all all the many types and sizes this stand will accommodate!The fact that it folds makes this stand easy to fold and go and use at work, at home, anywhere! Yet for me, I have one on my bedside table and one I keep in my purse for when I am on the go!Highly recommend this stand!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008TUQ7SC" id="B008TUQ7SC-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-23:</strong> It holds my phone when i am not.

All the stock Samsung docks for my phone, required me to remove my case. (Which I didn't want to do for various reasons.) After doing some research, I came across this stand/holder and thought to try it out. Well, this thing is great. I can place my phone in it secure, in both landscape and portrait view. I can adjust the viewing angle and its really sturdy, although light in weight.  I use my phone as an alarm clock. I needed to install a dock alarm clock app on my phone. So whenever I plug in the USB charger, the dock alarm clock would start up. (Just like it would if it was docked.)Pros1) Easy to use and fits most phones with a 5 inch. screen.2) Inexpensive.3) Folds up nice to fit in pocket and carry with you.4) Very sturdy and adjustable viewing angles.5) No need to by an expensive dock that only works for your phone.6) Light weight.7) Can charge phone in both landscape and portrait position.

The built-in kickstand is very hard to open, I usually have to pry it with a tool like tweezers. Otherwise the holes are cut out properly for the most part, and everything lines up. Though it's a hybrid case I don't see any reason to remove the second layer.

Doesn't seem too sturdy (as in if you make an attempt to break it, it will). But it should last you for a while, on day to day usage. It's quite free swiveling, and I thought it would have more resistance. that's just from seeing the pics, so if anyone also thought the same, the above is my response.That doesn't take away from the functionality, which it provides well.2) The sleep-awake feature works too.3) Except for the micro SD port (on the left side of the tablet), all other ports have cut outs. So if you swap micro SD cards often, you'll have to remove your tablet from the case every time.4) One thing to note in portrait mode, the tablet lean angle is about 45 and goes less. So if you're expecting an almost standing portrait case, it won't happen.5) small cut in the case, when I recieved it.However, for $11 shipped, I won't argue that it's a good case.Attached a few pics.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CGVF73Q" id="B00CGVF73Q-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-03:</strong> I replaced a different model case with this one. The tablet fits snugly inside the molded casing. It looks very professional and feels sturdy enough to protect it. Rotating wheel works fine and the stand does a good job of bracing the tablet in upright or horizontal orientations.I bought the higher end S-Pen for my tablet, so the elastic pen holder is good, although I'd have preferred something other than elastic since elastic rarely lasts very long. Same for the closing strap. It is nice for now and holds the case closed. But again, elastic is not my favorite choice of material.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CGVF73Q" id="B00CGVF73Q-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-17:</strong> I have a Samsung Galaxy 10&#34; tablet and it fit perfectly.  I like the way I can rotate it to stand up straight or on it's side.  The case feels sturdy and the elastic goes around the case to keep my tablet secure so I really like that.  It's a great case for the price.  I've had it for almost a year already and there are no rips, tears, or breaking.The 1 and only thing I can say, which really is not that big of a deal, is the tablet sometimes falls flat because the slot that suppose to hold it up to stand straight is not deep enough so at times it slides forward and I have to stand it up again.  On a flat surface it won't happen unless you are hitting the screen hard enough but when I'm sitting in bed and just move an inch it slides.  If the slot was a bit deeper it would have been perfect but again it's not really much of a big deal just wanted you to know 1 down side of it, if you consider that a down side at all.All-in-all it's a great case and protects my tablet exactly the way it should.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CGVF73Q" id="B00CGVF73Q-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-27:</strong> I originally chose this cover because of the versatility of the rotation feature, which I also enjoyed on a similar cover that I had for my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1.  This cover does work as advertised, holding the tablet in either portrait or landscape mode, but as other reviewers have noted, the stability as a stand leaves a little bit to be desired for the smaller 8&#34; tablets, particularly when trying to touch the tablet while it is in the stand mode.  Also, I utilize this cover with the international version of the Galaxy Note 8, and for that version, the magnetic auto sleep/wake feature does not appear to function properly.  Additionally, there is no cutout for either the SD card or the SIM card, so you will need to remove the tablet from the case entirely if you want to access those compartments.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CGVF73Q" id="B00CGVF73Q-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-01:</strong> I was surprised at the quality of this case, given how inexpensive it was. Its exterior feels soft and durable and I like that the inside is covered in a soft velour-like material to protect my tablet. The ability to rotate the screen, and to adjust the viewing position, is very nice. The one thing I wish it had is a small pocket on the inside to hold the user guide and other notes, etc. All in all, this is a very nice case and I may get another color or two.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CGVF73Q" id="B00CGVF73Q-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-08:</strong> love it, great for my needs</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CGVF73Q" id="B00CGVF73Q-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-23:</strong> Got this as part of my sister's Christmas gift.

All of the cuts for the ports in the tablet were well executed and all charger cables I tried on it worked perfectly.Now what I didn't like. For what I paid for this case, the way the had the closure stay was in my opinion an after thought. It is an elastic band that wraps around the end is the case. I also wish I had got it in another color besides white. It got filthy quick. You can clean the outside but you can't clean the felt that rests against the screen. It doesn't stay in the grooves very well to prop the tablet up for viewing either.If you are in the market for a mid priced case you could do better than this one but this case will work in a pinch and is still better than nothing to protect your investment. I ordered another one today and am going to give it a go.

I've had it now for about 2 weeks. With my origninal battery in the phone by the end of the day I'd be almost out of battery, and sometimes wouldn't even make it until the end of the day, now with this one I can get around 3 days. A full streamed movie will use about 5-6% battery life and trying to run it down I ran 6 movies in a row with it and was still over 55% battery life left!The back cover is the weakest point as it's just a basic plastic cover, I'd gladly pay more for a much better cover, and I'd almost considered changing the rating due to the cover. But for $20 I have an extended battery which I can't seem to kill in less than two days no matter what I do, and it easily can last 3-4 for normal use, how could I rate it less?

Ive already broken 4 clips and the back is coming off slightly...another clip or two, and I'm gonna need a bumper to keep it closed.Soooo, be very gentle when handling the battery cover, its not as sturdy as the original note 2 cover.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6U0N56" id="B00A6U0N56-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-24:</strong> I bought this battery for my Samsung Galaxy Note II and it works awesome I charged it and I can have it charged and ready to use Monday morning at 9am and the battery wont go out it Wednesday night.

The back cover I received was slightly different than the picture displayed at the time I ordered the battery.  I noticed that the photo has since been updated.  I prefer the stepped case anyway. Although I've only had it for a couple of days, the battery appears to be working great. My eyes aren't what they used to be so I always have the phone brightness on full.  Today, I've used the phone for 10 hours now, with over 2.5 hours of that being solid screen on-time, and still have 59%.  I could probably go twice as long if I can the auto-brightness on.  The new back cover does effectively double the thickness of the phone but it still fits nicely in my shirt pocket and the belt holster I occasionally use.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6U0N56" id="B00A6U0N56-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-18:</strong> Best case I have ever purchased you will love the power of this battery it is strong and last all day and fits well.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6U0N56" id="B00A6U0N56-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-19:</strong> I have absolutely no problems with the battery. I get a full day charge for my Note 2 with heavy use starting at about 7am. I'm on WiFi, use my Bluetooth 4-6 hours daily, watch videos, email, download and play games. The battery is at 20% by 9 pm and probably would last until midnight with no problems.I'm slightly disappointed because the back cover is such a horrible and low quality material. I had to remove the cover about 3 times and the first time I did these little tabs that's supposed to secure it to the back of the phone broke off. There is an "air gap" now at the top because the tabs are gone. So now dirt is getting into my phone. Also the other two times I did remove it, it would barely stay attached and took more than five minutes to resecure it back on. This is extremely annoying. I'm hoping I'll not have to remove the back any more because it may not go back on.I ordered the Zero Lemon for my S3 and I would have done it again for the Note 2 except I was trying to save money. If I had known the cover was so bad (yeah, the other reviews said the same about the cover but this company claimed they fixed the issue-THEY LIED!) Now I'll have to order their $9.99 case to keep my phone clean and secured. I'm annoyed.The battery is great...no doubts there but the cover drops the benefits of buying this product because it devalues the whole productWould I recommend this to friends? To other potential buyers? ABSOLUTELY NOT! Pay the extra for the Zero Lemon with the better case. I gave it 3* only because the battery is long lasting but until they create a more durable backing and/or include a case in the pricing don't bother with this item.Side note in case Hyperion is reading-I KNOW FULLY ABOUT YOUR WARRANTY BUT AS A CUSTOMER I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO GET A REPLACEMENT ON A PRODUCT THAT IS NOT EVEN 3 MONTHS OLD! I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO CONTACT YOU AND GET THE RUN AROUND AND ASK FOR A NEW BACKING!

As a rooted user of my Note 3 I wasn't capable of using NFC to make payment with my mobile device using ISIS, because the application does not work on rooted devices, and was not upset to lose the NFC ability due to using this Qi receiver. However once I discovered the RootCloak modification, which allows rooted users to disguise the rooted status of the device to any target application installed on the phone, I very quickly decided to push the limit of this product and make modifications to this Qi receiver to get NFC functional again. I was successful in my endeavor, reducing this product down to the 1/3 of its original size and thickness, enabling NFC and retaining wireless charging and S view functions. PERFECT! This is the only option you have if you desire to keep all of these functions on your device, without buying the very expensive OEM wireless charging battery door cover (which doesn't allow you to use ANY cases, expect TPU, for your device because of the added thickness in the OEM wireless charging battery door, so that's a definite FAIL IMO)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GJH5M42" id="B00GJH5M42-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-09:</strong> Very slim, doesn't create any bulge through the battery door and charges well.

Even with a bass-boosting EQ, the low-end is thinner than the new iPad.  They certainly sound no better than the stock Apple headphones, but cost many times more.  It is nice that there are no less than 5 different-size tips that can be used, but none of them improved the very weak low-end.  Even music that is supposed to have a thump ended up with nothing more than a flabby slap.  It's a shame, too, because the midrange and high-end is actually pretty good.IF you are a jazz or acoustic music listener, than this may not be an issue, but rock, funk, and soul listeners will need to go elsewhere.  As for this pair, they are going right back for a refund.If anyone can suggest a decent-sounding pair of earbuds that will actually hold up under use, than I would really like to know what they are.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00427WG9U" id="B00427WG9U-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-12:</strong> These headphones sound great and come with 3 sizes of ear pieces.

I actually went through 4 of these before I could get one installed correctly because I'm a moron I guess. The fit is good and they adhere to the screen really well. I just couldn't seem to make them fit at first and once I got them to fit perfectly I couldn't work all the bubbles out. Because of my cat, I couldn't seem to get out all the hair or bubbles out. So I realize that these issues aren't because of a bad product or a low rating.What I didn't like about the protectors was the fact that the more I used my phone, and using the swype function for the virtual keyboard, and the more I swyped words, the more the protector formed minute scratches in the same patterns of my finger presses and the more dull the screen seemed to appear, especially in these areas. So, since attempting to use the protectors, I find that over time with constant use, the seem to scratch and really make the screen look cheap. So, I removed it once again and probably won't attempt to add a screen protector as the original screen of the phone seems to do a pretty good job at being able to clean up finger prints and NEVER scratches or becomes dull looking. With the other screen protectors that I have purchased before as I mentioned above about being from the same company because of the way they install, didn't seem to scratch up over time and didn't seem to rob the device of the screen sensativety like these do. I liked those ones.Not sure at this point if I recommend these to anyone else. I guess I could say...try them at your own risk. I will probably not buy them again.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0042GI1BI" id="B0042GI1BI-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-21:</strong> I bought this phone because of the rating on CNET, don't do it!

Honestly, with the Gorilla Glass screen, you don't need anything more. These fit perfectly, and unlike other protectors I've purchased, these even cover the soft buttons at the bottom (Menu, Home, etc). They are dry-apply (No soap and water needed) so you may find you get dust under them -- just use a piece of scotch tape to pick them off the bottom of the screen and drop it again! It does come with three protectors, so if you mess it up completely, you have another chance at it right away.

I was very careful to follow the instructions, including leaving my beloved phone at home for 36 hours (instructions say 24, but I figured another night wouldn't hurt it). After that time, there were a few very small bubbles still - the instructions said these would go away, and THEY DID! I was worried about them and thought maybe I'd need to reapply the protector, or use the card to try to smooth the bubbles out, but I let them come out on their own, and after a day or two they were completely gone.My only disappointment with this product is that about 1/3 of the screen on the left side now has a "rainbow effect" and I haven't discovered how to get this to go away.

But still I followed the directions.  The "spreader" they give you in the box isnt the best I've used, but it works.  As others have said, FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS!  The most important thing to do is to let the skin sit on the phone at least 12 hours before using the phone.  It took 2 whole days for all of the bubbles to come out, but they are completely gone.  Every square millimeter of the screen is protected!I am very happy with the skin and love the way it feels.  My only complaint, and its extremely minor, and Ive seen other skins do this too, so its really not a big deal, but if you use your fingernail to tap the screen (my girlfriend cant break herself of this habit), it leaves a little indentation in the skin which will eventually go away, but its slightly visible when you see reflected light on the screen.  But this, in no way, impacts the usability of the phone.  You cant even see it when looking straight on.Update - 6/14/11Its been over 6 months since Ive installed the Skinomi on my G2 and am happy to report that I still have no scratches, edge peels, or any other signs of wear.  I have have many people ask me what type of screen protector I have as many people paid a lot more for other types from retail stores and havent been as happy as I have.

I'm already disappointed.If you are a habitual nail biter/have no protruding nails left, don't play any games or use the onscreen keyboard on your phone this is probably for you.  Otherwise, stay away.The actual material is rather soft and very susceptible to gouging. I have found that the gouges do tend to heal themselves - after a a week or more.  But if you use the screen regularly, that ain't gonna cut it.  Being in a well lit environment makes the gouges and other marks (striations) show up annoyingly well; if you're in a low light environment you hardly notice them.After reading about the warranty in the reviews here - save your money and buy a different, cheaper one.The only positive things I find are:1) it is indeed incredibly clear2) its easy to apply and no bubbles/particles etc</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B0045LHHCY', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B0045LHHCY', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B008CC3PKU</h2>    <p class="price"> $B008CC3PKU</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008CC3PKU" id="B008CC3PKU-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-05:</strong> These will connect to both my iPhone and my iPad, but the connection feels a bit off and it doesn't fit as smoothly as the actual Apple version of this cord.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008CC3PKU" id="B008CC3PKU-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-12:</strong> I am glad I chose these connectors based on the many options available on Amazon.

I love the way my nexus is without a case, but since I sometimes drop my phone and don't trust other peoples clumsiness either, I know I need some protection for it. I had one of the cruzerlite cases for my nexus, but as cute as that android was on the back, I felt the case was a bit more bulky than I'd like. After reading review after review, I came across this feather case. The main downside, as others have pointed out, is the lack of protection on the top and bottom of the phone, and the tiny gap between the phone and case from the pad inside. I've had this case for about a week now, and though it isn't "perfect", its lightweight, stylish and gives me better access to my charging port.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0060AHUB6" id="B0060AHUB6-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-30:</strong> I have bought at least 15 cases for the galaxy nexus and this is without a doubt the worst one yet. I assume it is a defective unit. The sides are so loose it falls off in my pocket. I did a test drop onto carpet from about 18 inches and the case flew across the room. In addition, it offers no protection to the top or bottom of the device. I wasn't concerned after looking at the pictures because I assumed there was at least enough lip on the case to offer some protection but there isn't. If you are looking for a super thin case then I would recommend the ringke slim. It is actually thinner than this case and offers protection to both the top and bottom. This case is really a poor design. They claim it is only a millimeter thin but it adds as much girth as a TPU case while offering none of the protection. I strongly recommend looking elsewhere. As I said earlier, if you want a phone that feels naked, go with the ringke. It is a much better case in both looks and protection. Actually, this case is worse than all of the $2 Chinese cases I've bought. In my experience and opinion if you want protection and excellent fit go with the cruzerlite case. If you want sexy and a nearly naked phone go with the ringke.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0060AHUB6" id="B0060AHUB6-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-22:</strong> This one is a really really awesome casemakes it feels really nice the phone in your hand and besides that looks really good.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0060AHUB6" id="B0060AHUB6-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-22:</strong> I bougth this one year ago and it was the best Case i've ever had.

I have the Verizon Nexus with standard battery.  The Feather case is easy to put on and take off, an important consideration for anyone planning on using the Samsung OEM car dock and/or OEM desktop dock that utilize the charging pins on the right side of the phone.  The case is grippy as well and fits the phone perfectly.  It has wide open cutouts that allow direct access to the phone's volume and on/off buttons without interference.  The case wraps around the back and sides and edges of the phone but leaves the top and bottom edge exposed. While it doesn't cover the entire phone like the Incipio NGP, the trade off is that it is extremely light and adds very little to the phone's girth.I've seen other reviews in which people complain that the Feather doesn't provide sufficient protection.  I guess these folks didn't bother to read the advertising first, or didn't pick up on the fact that the very name ("Feather") implies light protection. This case is for people looking to enhance grip and protect the phone from scratches.  If you're a brick mason, a heavy machine operator or are just rough on your phones, get something else, like the Incipio Silicrylic.  I have also read elsewhere that some people felt the need to modify their cutouts, but this must have been for an earlier version of the Feather case than the one I have.  It needs no modification as the cutouts are well designed and large.Another nice thing is that the Incipio Feather case comes with a high quality dry screen protector.If you are looking for a very lightweight and thin cover that protects the Verizon version of the phone (with std. battery) from light scratches and bumps, this is a great choice.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0060AHUB6" id="B0060AHUB6-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-13:</strong> Ok so I just got this case and the first thing you notice is that it looks really good. However, the fit isn't as flush and perfect as I expected, the cut outs are perfect but what I notice is that it is slightly raised in the back as if they didn't accommodate enough for the curve that the galaxy nexus has.

Easily and quickly snaps into place. The outside has a rubbery texture that gives the phone good grip. The edges fill out just enough to protect the screen if it's dropped face down but also doesn't interfere with normal operation of the screen. All of the buttons are accessible and the cutouts for the camera, mic, and speakerphone are perfect. The inside of the case has a rubber padding which helps with some shock absorption (or so we'll see).I prefer a thin case to keep with the sleek slim design while also adding some extra grip. I've also used an Otterbox Commuter; and while both are great cases the Otterbox felt a little too big for my taste. (Yes I know the Commuter series is not that big.) The case includes a screen protector and I'm still trying to decide my feelings on it. The cut out is close to perfect and only a few bubbles remain. However, the bottom edges are slightly lifting, it does slightly reduce the sensitivity of the touch screen, and adds some glare.I gave it 4 stars, instead of 5, because the bottom and top corners are only partially covered. The top and bottom are entirely exposed. Obviously on the bottom there was a need to have access to the microphone, USB plug, and earphone jack. But I still felt there could have been a little more coverage to protect the areas around it. Also, I do find a lot of dust, lint, and dirt build up in the sides and behind the case; most likely from being in a pocket most of the day. Not a huge deal, just means I weekly take off the case and wipe it and the phone down.Overall, I'm very satisfied with this case. I believe it gives good coverage and protection without adding unnecessary size to the phone. I will be looking to Incipio for future cases the next time I upgrade my phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0060AHUB6" id="B0060AHUB6-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-08:</strong> This case does exactly what I was looking for. Gives my phone just a little more protection that no case while still maintaining a slim profile. It goes in and out of my pocket with ease and feels almost as good as having a phone with no case. This does leave the top and bottom somewhat exposed, which should be obvious from the photo. If you're looking for full protection look elsewhere, this case is not designed for that. In another review someone mentioned the power button being more difficult to press and they are right. This is the only grip I have, and was the only reason I didn't rate at 5 stars. I'm sure they need the case to be a little thicker there to maintain structural integrity but it interferes with functionality. Nothing too major, I got used to this within the first day. Overall I'd say great case if your looking for something slim buy this!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0060AHUB6" id="B0060AHUB6-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-14:</strong> The Incipio Feather is my go-to case for every smartphone I've owned.It's durable and fits like a glove.This thing is really, really thin!  That's great because this phone is not the smallest/thinnest to begin with.The matte finish adds the perfect amount of texture to keep it from slipping out of your hand.Two caveats:If you're looking for a case that fits the phone with the extended battery in, this ain't it.  Doesn't fit.And if you're looking for a case that will provide fall protection, look elsewhere.  There's no rubber cushion here.What it does provide is a durable matte covering for your phone to keep it from flying out of your hand, without being big and bulky and making you look like you're holding a palm pilot.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0060AHUB6" id="B0060AHUB6-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-19:</strong> a protector, really thin despite the size of the phone, fits perfectly with no problem and is not uncomfortable.No problem you can reach all the buttons, but the spaces of the head and the bottom are exposed to direct hits but it is understood by the size and design of the same</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0060AHUB6" id="B0060AHUB6-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-01-01:</strong> I can't say enough how much I love this case. If you don't really want a case on your Nexus but at the same time do not want to scratch or ding it, this is the case. The only thing is that the top and bottom aren't covered. If you're worried about that, check out a TPU case. It is so thin that there is no noticeable weight difference. If you need a belt clip, the one that comes with the hideous Verizon shell/holster combo works really nicely. You can get away with using the Seidio surface case slip, but it is a tiny bit loose at the top of the phone. I don't use an extended battery, so I can't say whether it fits or not.PROS:- Extremely thin and lightweight- Compatible with other brands' holsters- Matte finish adds gripCONS:- Top and bottom of phone is exposed</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0060AHUB6" id="B0060AHUB6-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-03:</strong> I normally don't use cases because I don't like the added bulk, but this case is so thin that it's hardly noticeable.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0060AHUB6" id="B0060AHUB6-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-22:</strong> This is the second Incipio case I have owned.  I have one for the Motorola Atrix.  I love the minimal thickness of the case which allows its use in docks, however, the case does not fit the curved shape of the Nexus.  As a result, the case rattles when the vibrate notification goes off.  However, the case does provide some protection for the case itself and after removing it a couple of times the case has not shown any signs of stress cracks that other Incipio models have shown.  However, Incipio does offer a very good replacement service that I have used for the Atrix case and as such I do recommend them for people that use a dock with their phones.  I have since stopped using this case due to the vibration noise issue and have switched to a TPU soft gel case.  This has a much better fit and eliminates the noise issue.  It shoudl also provide a little more protection than the this case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B0060AHUB6', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B0060AHUB6', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B007ZTT3KW</h2>    <p class="price"> $B007ZTT3KW</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007ZTT3KW" id="B007ZTT3KW-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-02:</strong> The case came very quickly and fit well.

I started looking at it originally because the JKase cases everyone seemed to be buying were a combination of overpriced and out of stock. So I got this instead.I had three major objectives in buying this case: spend as little as possible, be unobtrusive, and protect the phone. This case accomplishes those objectives. It is an entirely dull piece of molded gel that has holes in the right places. It feels nice, with a pleasant nonslip grip. I haven't trying testing it by dropping the phone, but the skin is thick enough to protect the phone from waist high drops. Shipping is fast. It must be working well in general because I don't notice it.Would I buy this again? Yes. Is it a style statement? I hope not. Are there better forms of protection? Probably, but the phone didn't cost enough to justify them. The only thing I regret is that I forget to tell my girlfriend to get one for her phone. Oh well.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B007ZTT3KW', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B007ZTT3KW', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B003L18Z8E</h2>    <p class="price"> $B003L18Z8E</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003L18Z8E" id="B003L18Z8E-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-11:</strong> This worked just the way I needed it to.

Well fear not this super long cord is amazing! You just have to remember to squeeze the button thingys that are on the ipod end of the cord, this releases the hold on your ipod. My real purpose for this was so I could charge my kids itouch while in the car (you know the cars with NO plugs in the back) it reaches from my front seat charging area to the back seat perfectly! I bought 3 of these cause we always forget where we left the other charger...and with this price you should get a few too. Love this thing, and I didn't have to spend a small fortune for Apple's over priced accessory!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003L18Z8E" id="B003L18Z8E-review42" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-01-19:</strong> This cable comes in handy.

The first picture on the amazon product page for this cable has what looks like a generic connector that you plug into the iPhone/iPad. That's the type of connector that looks bigger (fatter?) than the slimmer connector that you see on the current real Apple cables. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the cable that I actually received had the connector that was just like the ones you see on the more current real Apple cables. See the picture that I posted at the top of this product's amazon page for the cable that I received.I bought this cable from amazon marketplace seller 'The OEM Shop' for under three dollars with free S&H.; I received the cable very quickly in five days. I do NOT work for 'The OEM Shop' or for Amazon, but I mention the name of the seller because very few people seem to mention the name of the amazon marketplace seller who they bought a product from in their reviews. These cables are "generic" and it is often difficult to tell which seller sold the product that the buyer is either complaining about or praising in a product review. Also, a lot of buyers don't seem to realize that they can select a particular seller and not just take whoever is the seller who may be appearing as the "default" seller on an amazon product page. I don't know what determines who is the "default" seller, but I'm guessing that Amazon comes first if Amazon has the product in their warehouse(s), but if not, then maybe the other sellers are possibly rotated as the "default" seller on the page, and so on and so forth. Anyways, I think it is worth mentioning who is the particular amazon marketplace seller is in a review - especially if the product is generic like this cable and if there are a lot of sellers who are selling the product via the one single amazon product page.Anyways, the cable that I bought is indeed a nice long six-foot cable. It looks like the real thing. And it was new. I was able to charge my iPhone and iPad by using this cable when connected to a charger plugged into the wall. And I was able to sync my iPhone and iPad with iTunes on my macbook. The cable was also able to charge my iPhone via the USB on my macbook. For my iPhone, I've tried charging with both a real official apple power adapter and also a generic power adapter - and both worked. (Of course, for my iPad, I had to use the 10w charger that came with my iPad because you can't use anything else when charging from an electrical outlet in the wall.) I will be using this nice long six-foot cable for whenever I want to charge my iPhone or iPad for like when I want to use my iPhone or iPad when I'm in bed or if I'm sitting elsewhere like at the kitchen table and if I want to save the battery for later. (I would be keeping the shorter original cable that came with my iPhone/iPad for use with my macbook for syncing the iPhone/iPad.) I'm happy with this purchase and with this cable.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003L18Z8E" id="B003L18Z8E-review61" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-10-14:</strong> Bought while I still had the iPhone.. worked great and gave me the extra space that I needed so I could charge my phone while in bed.

The keyboard in this phone is really great; wider spaced keys (on the android keybd) and much less 'touchy' than the 800g was.  Now it is a pleasure to text again.  I also like the feature to shut off the 'phone lock' if I wish to and I use that a lot; being home most days there is no need for me to have the phone constantly lock up.  Volume on this phone is very good as I have some hearing loss and many phones I've tried I just could not get them loud enough.  The touchscreen is smooth with no glitches and scrolling (as thru contacts) is a breeze with this phone.  One problem I am having is a friend sent me 3 photos I want to save (to my sd card) and when I call up the photo, there is no option to save it that I have found.  Will have to work on that I guess.  My main complaint and the reason for 4 stars is that I cannot use the wifi on this phone.  I have a Netgear router and went to their site to verify my password; but the only way I can connect this phone to my wifi is to choose "WAP" on Netgear's site.  And then, I cannot use my notebook or my tablet, because they are currently under a stronger security setting.  From what I have seen (and might be wrong here), the WAP setting is a very weak security setting and not recommended.  I bought this phone specifically because it had wifi and would save me some minutes when I'm at home, but I cannot connect to it.  Other than the wifi, I think it is a pretty stable phone.UPDATE: 7/30/13 - I felt I had to add one additional feature of this phone (LG840G) at this time and that is the virtual qwerty keyboard is only available while you are texting. It will not come up while searching online or at any other time that I have found (even though I have it set for default).  For me, this was a big disappointment because I've never had a phone that operates like this.  I love the qwerty keyboard and simply cannot stand using the std number keypad.  Bad idea LG; very bad idea for a so-called phone of today.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CO665MA" id="B00CO665MA-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-24:</strong> If all you need is a phone with an easy interface, this is a great value.

I can hear my phone ringing when I have it in my desk at work.  I like that I can change fonts from small to very large.  I have mine set on large.  I use the tip calculator and notepad quite frequently. I like that the phone automatically shuts off after a couple of minutes so that way I don't accidentally dial a phone number and use my minutes.  I have found that I only have to charge phone every couple of days.  I prefer to use my Kindle Fire instead of phone when I want to use wifi or email.

It's better than a non-smart phone, but it's also not quite what some people might be used to.  It's missing a lot of little things I enjoyed on my droid, but for the price you can't really complain.  But it's really nice looking.  Great battery life as well.  It works for calls, internet, text and that's good enough.  Camera is poor, but I don't really use it much.  Otherwise, no real complaints.  One thing I will complain about is the spam phone calls I get since I signed up for Tracfone.  Nobody knows my number and I have yet to ever give it to anyone, but I get calls all the time from various numbers. I won't blame the phone for that, but something to think about if you decide to go with Tracfone since the phone is unusable if you don't use their service.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CO665MA" id="B00CO665MA-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-07:</strong> A great phone for the money!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CO665MA" id="B00CO665MA-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-07:</strong> This is the best Tracfone you can by that does not have a keyboard.

Since I already had a Tracfone this seemed to be a good solution in the mean time.I was pleasantly surprised by the intuitiveness of this phone's functions and the ease of transferring my old number, minutes & service to the new phone, which I did thru my online account. Being able to browse online using the WI-Fi capability without using minutes (as long as you have access to a network) is a big plus, and of course you still have the option to burn some minutes to browse if a network isn't available and you have a cell signal, which doesn't seem to be all that bad since Tracfone has some data to minutes formula rather than charging for the time you actually spend online. Another plus is this phone came with Triple Minutes For Life verses my old phone's Double Minutes For Life, adding more justification for the upgrade.As other folks have mentioned in their reviews, there are some compromises when it comes to the operating system, other software, & availability of the virtual keyboard, but I think there may be apps that can be added and tweaks to be sniffed out as workarounds for the encountered deficiencies, which I've yet to have the chance to fully explore. This phone has already easily met my expectations and can only get better as I learn more about it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CO665MA" id="B00CO665MA-review19" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-21:</strong> This is a good starter phone that would have any rug-rat convinced they can mimic Mom on her iPhone.There are a lot of reports about the 840's problematic Wi-Fi provision, and I am somewhat disappointed that mine also arrived with that same defect.I had more plans for this little phone that is just one step short of being an Android, and certainly the many comments and YouTube videos tell a different story of success for the many avid enthusiasts happily using this phone.But attempts to upgrade my old Tracfone began a chain of problems that finalized with a realization that its Wi-Fi would not be working for me, and ironically any further attempt to return this phone would result in a loss of remaining service time. Tracfone has more control over their phones than what they would readily reveal, but it's hardly worth the time involved in getting everything corrected when I would never consider using it in place of an Android anyway.  The 840's Web browser is very basic.LG also made an attempt to provide a suitable clipboard memory in this 840, but unfortunately that fell short of expectations as well, so it's one and only success remains in its Bluetooth provision that received some improvement over its LG800G predecessor. Bluetooth remains as its one shining ability other than being a truly reliable text/voice phone that is made even less costly by allowing triple minutes.We can hope that the successor of this phone will be better provisioned and include reliable components, so if not yet decided about this phone, then I would suggest passing this one up for now in favor of the much more extensive and rewarding abilities provided in a variety of other smartphones that sell for about the same price as this mere toy.UPDATE:  July 29, 2013I made corrections above regarding this smartphone and should also state that a fair appraisal of this little phone would also include some features I neglected to cover previously. In fact it has a couple more rather welcome and significant improvements over its LG800G predecessor, the first being its ability to be connected to a PC as a mass storage device. This allows data files, videos, music, pics, etc. to be copied or moved from your PC directly to the phone's internal memory so they can be viewed, played, or sent by this phone. Secondly, it shows a superb ability to play recorded movies or video and sound podcasts and mp3 music. Videos must be converted first and conform to sizing specifications, and the directions for doing all of this can be found with a search of the Web.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CO665MA" id="B00CO665MA-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-29:</strong> I am really enjoying my phone.

Needless to say I'm disappointed. I wrote the manufacturer in hopes that the product I received might be defective, but after endless promises that someone would contact me I have given up.  Here are some things to consider...1.) The case does fit the phone, but no better than a generic case. My specific case has extra space and visibly wiggles around the phone loosely.2.) The rubber around the case (the material that gives the case the rubberized feel) wears off with easy rubbing.3.) The case will scratch the sides of your phone. Had I known this I would have simply gone with a ghost shield or zagg.If you're buying this case with the expectation that you're buying something premium, you'll be disappointed. There are a lot of positive reviews about this product, but notice that almost all are from people who 'just bought' the product. There are several similar cases that can be found on Amazon for under $1, this case offers no more protection than one of those.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0040X39EM" id="B0040X39EM-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-16:</strong> I've had this for a while and it has protected my Epic 4G very well.

"Rubberized" finish feels great and provides the perfect amount of grip without feeling sticky, especially when taking your phone in and out of pockets.  I've already dropped my phone more than a few times and this case has done its job to perfection.  It does add a little more bulk to an already bulky phone but that's to be expected for those of us who choose a slide out keyboard.

I mean, do you reeeeeeally love your iPhone? So much that you wouldn't dare put it in your pocket, purse or bag like 99% of everyone else out there, but only do because you don't have any other options aside from maybe a belt clip? Well, you're in luck, as now you can wear it around your neck with the iHangy!The iHangy is a cheaply made lanyard for your iPhone that does two things: makes it easily accessible for you so you don't have to go through pockets to get your phone, and it makes you look like a complete tool. This is the kind of thing where, when people see you with it around your neck in public, you -will- get looks, and not the kind that are envious. I don't even see people wearing their work IDs on lanyards around their necks, so what are the chances you'll see anyone wearing this for more than a few minutes?Divided into two main parts, the iHangy tries to offer protection for your iPhone. First there's the incredibly thin silicone skin that you put your phone into. Then you slide it into the equally incredibly thin plastic hanger that the lanyard connects to. There is nothing to keep the silicone case secure inside the plastic case- the sides are both open. Even the elastic lanyard piece doesn't seem to be all that stable when you connect it to the case. We wore the iHangy for about 30 minutes, walking around, climbing stairs and all kinds of normal things, and it was coming loose when we finally checked on it. Using your phone while in the iHangy isn't that fun either. The sides of the silicone and plastic case make touching whatever you need to on the screen a little hard.The product's box also needs some attention. This is the most boring box for a product aimed at something that's trying to be fashionable (more on that in a second). It has orange and white stripes going around the whole thing, and the iHangy only takes up around 35% of the whole box. There's also this horrendous summary of the product on the back, which mentions that this is where function meets fashion. As if that weren't bad enough, they use such words and phrases as "your expensive iPhone 5c" and "investment" when referring to the iPhone. Good lord people, iPhone owners aren't kings or anything. Enough of this already.I will be nice and give it an extra star for two reasons. One being that I had fun making a video for it, and the other reason is that the iPhone's buttons aren't obscured with the covering. You can adjust the volume, hit the Home button and all that just fine.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JAOFPZW" id="B00JAOFPZW-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-19:</strong> Not to be sexist, but when I saw this product I immediately thought of my two teenage daughters.  They wear skinny jeans (with teeny tiny pockets) and refuse to carry purses.  Even though they are fashionistas, they insist on stuffing their iPhones into these tiny pockets which is not only unfashionable it's risky. The phones sometimes slide right out of their pockets.  We had gotten my younger daughter a lanyard wallet to carry her money, etc. in.  A lanyard for her iPhone was something we were willing to try.Let's start with the case.  It's a two part case with a flexible silicone sleeve you put over your phone.  You then slide that into a had outer shell.  The phone is completely protected on three sides like most decent cases.  Even the home button is covered. The port cut outs are where you'd expect them.  My only beef is the bottom part of the case, where the headphone jacks is, extends out beyond the bottom of the phone. That isn't a problem as long as you have head phones with narrow and straight in 3.5mm jacks.  If you have headphones with a 90 bend on the jack, as some of mine have, they are not going to fit into the jack anymore without an extension.One concern I had was the sturdiness of the clip that attaches the case to the lanyard. The phone is most definitely not going to slip out of the case, but if the connector isn't secure, the whole case could become detached from the lanyard, leading to a disaster when you phone drops from around your neck.  The clip seems to be secure enough. You just want to make sure you have it clipped in securely.  I caught my daughter nervously slinging the phone around a couple of times (and it never came off).  She also tosses her phone into the air for fun. That's one reason we like having a sturdy case for her.The clip comes with a very short and stubby stylus.  The stylus is pretty much worthless, IMO. They could have left that off. The case is available in multiple color combinations if you purchase it separately, but it appears the combo I got - with the lanyard necklace, only comes in blue and white.  My daughter didn't really care for the color at first since she has a yellow phone, but it grew on her.Another issue my daughter has with the device is the cord is pretty long.  Even on the illustration on the packaging, it shows the phone hanging down so the top of it is about mid-way down your stomach.  She would like it a few nches higher.  We figured out a way to adjust the strap to move it higher with the included sliding clip, but it creates a second loop behind your neck that is a bit awkward.  My daughter is 5'10" tall, so, this would be really long on a shorter person.Pros:* Decent case- the case alone is worth the price* Keeps your phone available and secure* Great for when you don't have pockets or have shallow or tight pocketsCons:* Headphone port might be inaccessible depending on your headphones (works fine with Apple headphones)* Lanyard is a few inches too long causing phone to hang too low</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JAOFPZW" id="B00JAOFPZW-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-14:</strong> I had trouble getting around this review because I did not see many uses for this. That is until I was talking to a friend, who is in construction and was on a ladder, trying to make notes into his iPhone and butt-dialing and texting at the same time. It was perfect for him.First off, this is not a fashionable case, but it can be useful. It is definitely not for me. But, it can be useful to others.The case is pretty flimsy. It is a skin really, not a case. It is made from a rubberized plastic and it fits the iPhone but it is not a perfect fit. There is no screen cover so you have to be careful about scratches. The skin is not going to really protect your phone against falls.What would protect it is that the lanyard attaches to your phone through the charging port. The secure fit definitely keeps the phone with you and not in the floor.So, fashionable? No. Useful? Yes, for some. Protective of your phone? Only for minor scratches.*Sample provided for review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JAOFPZW" id="B00JAOFPZW-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-20:</strong> I received this in the mail today, fortunately as I was working in my vegetable garden this afternoon and I like to listen to music from my Iphone.  However, I didn't have a pocket!  So, this product arrived on a good day.It was nicely packaged and very easy to put together.  Overall, I think it's a pretty cool concept.  Thankfully, it's not cheapy.  The materials are well made, although I feel that the white outer case will probably stay white, while the silicone lanyard will probably discolor...I see yellow grime coming on.Nonetheless...on to the pros -vs- cons:Pros...* Lanyard is adjustable (and stays)* The inner silicone case (blue) is soft and stretches over the phone very easily and the buttons/connections line up well* The outer UV plastic, fits pretty snug with the phone once you slide it in and the buttons/connections also line up well* It looks pretty fashionable* The phone is well protectedCons...* The stylus connector piece will be my biggest gripe.  Absolutely pointless to have a mini stylus in this design...firstly...no one uses them???  Secondly...it's the lanyard connector you have to squeeze the stylus tip and the other end together (pretty hard) to get the piece to fit into the center (bottom) connection, where the power charger connection cutout is.  NOW...here's my gripe - depending on which way you put it in - the stupid stylus piece sticking off the end of this design (see pics) covers either the auxiliary connection or the microphone/speaker (?).  I have to say this is the portion that needs working on.  I would remove the stylus so that both end connections are clear.  You would however, still have to disconnect the lanyard to charge your phone.* Inner silicone cover (blue) is so soft that it is not tight enough fit and sit flush against the sides of the phone.  Meaning, once you slide it into the outer UV cover, the sides (blue silicone) that are loose stick out from the white.FYI...I received this product from the manufacturer in lieu of a fair consumer review.6/12/14 - UPDATE:I wanted to note that the outer case that the phone slides into WILL EASILY crack if you drop it.  The phone will still be protected, however you will lose the ability to "hang" the phone properly.  Mine fell off of my nightstand and completely shattered the top along the molding seam.  Just an FYI:)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JAOFPZW" id="B00JAOFPZW-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-02:</strong> Disclaimer: I received a review sample from the manufacturer.There's no doubt that the case is sturdy and well-made, and fits the phone in a nice, snug manner. The cutouts are carefully arranged to expose jacks, controls, microphone, etc. This immediately became a replacement for the &#34;factory&#34; case that I bought with the iPhone. One drawback, though: the inner edges lap a little into the touchscreen area. This could be an issue if you need to touch at the very extreme edge of the screen (and hence one star off the rating).Now, the add-ons. I know some people like the lanyard, and if you do, this is a good choice for you without doubt. I didn't care for it. I didn't like the sensation of the phone around my neck flopping around when moving or turning quickly. Your mileage may vary; you'll love it or hate it depending on your usage. It's nice to have the phone readily and quickly available to, say, take a photo quickly, but in the end I ended up not using the lanyard.The capacitive stylus is certainly useful for some things, but I can't say it's exactly necessary and with the attachment system the way it is, it is a portability nuisance. I would say if you need the stylus, and you won't for the vast majority of apps, carry it separately in a briefcase or similar. Otherwise leave it home for the most part.All in all, a well-made protective case with add-ons that you can take or leave as you wish.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JAOFPZW" id="B00JAOFPZW-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-29:</strong> Over the past couple of weeks I've really come to appreciate the hands free, immediate accessibility that iHangy's lanyard style necklace casing has come to offer. Having the device dangling from your neck ready to go in a jiff is a blessed convenience once you experience it for yourself. For instance...+used this on a couple of new hikes where we frequently needed to checks maps/gps for navigation+used it at the park to have the camera ready to take pictures of the kids+listening to podcasts (via speaker) while cooking and doing household chores+used it to listen to music on a flight rather than keeping the device in my pants pocketGetting the device into the case is really easy and takes less than a minute thanks to the very handy instructions provided. The lanyard necklace strap has a soft rubberized feel and doesn't irritate my skin even after many hours of contact. The strap is also adjustable so you can extend it to fully where your phone will drop near your belly button or you can raise it higher if preferred. I have the white/blue casing and my main nitpick is the cheapish look and feel of the white plastic. Still, in this case functionality wins over form. Good case overall.note: I was provided a sample of this product for review purposes.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JAOFPZW" id="B00JAOFPZW-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-02:</strong> This was different enough from other iPhone cases I've tried out, so I thought it would be interesting to review... the iHangy case. I never thought about how hanging my iPhone around my neck might work out, but it was better than I expected.The iHangy case has two parts. The inner case is a silicon-based sleeve that fits snugly over the phone. You could leave this on full-time, and it would do a reasonably good job in keeping your phone safe from minor scratches. The outer case is a hard plastic shell with open sides, and the inner case (and iPhone) slides in from either side. The plastic case gives you more of the drop protection that you expect from a shell-style cover. The openings for the front button, photo lens, and all other controls are positioned well, and it's a good case at this base level.What the iHangy does differently is give you the option to attach a lanyard to the case. The rubber cord has a locking mechanism that fits into the charging slot on the phone. When you put that on the phone, you adjust the length of the lanyard, slip it around your neck, and you're off. The locking mechanism also has a small stylus on it, so that's a bonus if you prefer to use a stylus but don't want to carry one around all the time.I was a little concerned at first that it might not be as secure as I'd like, but I couldn't get the lock to fail. It's not coming off the phone until you push the side buttons to unlock and remove it. The inner silicon case grips the outer shell very well, so it's not going to slide out inadvertently. I used it for a walk, and it was nice to not have to stick the phone in a pocket (for the activity tracker) or always have to carry it in my hand. Like most lanyard tags, the momentum of your body can get the phone bouncing back and forth in time to your walking. I found it worked best if I tucked it into my jacket so that it was held in place by the fabric.I won't be using this as my everyday case, as I don't want to have my iPhone around my neck all the time. But depending on my activity or attire, I can imagine that this would be a great option to have available.Disclosure:Obtained From: ManufacturerPayment: Free</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JAOFPZW" id="B00JAOFPZW-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-29:</strong> I've had this protective case for a few weeks and have already found many uses for it. It was great to have on a recent vacation where we took a boat excursion  - iHangy case allowed me easy access to the phone (mainly for taking photos) while keeping it protected from sunscreen, water, dirt, etc. I've also used iHangy while working out instead of my usual armband, while walking my dog to listed to music, etc.I've lost many phones because they've fallen out of purses or because I left them sitting somewhere. With the iHangy I have my phone hanging around my neck reducing the likelihood of leaving it on the counter somewhere.I don't see the point for the stylus  - I don't know anyone who uses these for iPhones. It's not that inconvenient but just adds unnecessary bulk.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00JAOFPZW', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00JAOFPZW', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B006SK5FYM</h2>    <p class="price"> $B006SK5FYM</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006SK5FYM" id="B006SK5FYM-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-10:</strong> I was surprised that this actually felt good in the hand.

Interested in anyone that is able to find a case that works with this dock.Also note, depending on your sensitivity to high frequency sounds, you may hear when the charger is charging a spare.

Not having to worry about charging or dying batteries has been amazing. I HATE WIRES. The charger has a nice indicating light to when the batteries are fully charged and even has a USB port to charge the phone through a cord.Although both batteries were not able to fully charge to 100% using the included charger ( 89 and 90% ) they lasted just as long if not longer then the OEM batteries. Especially if charged to 100 using the phone.Although annoying I could have definitely have lived with this considering how convenient having two batteries was.Unfortunately tonight the charger, which feels extremely cheap, has stopped working all together. One of the charging pins seems to have gotten pushed into the charger itself and can not make contact with the battery. When I shake the charger I can hear something small shaking inside. So now I am back to using my OEM battery with a wire like a before, and it sucks more then ever.Also just an FYI the charger does not charge the OEM battery at all, even from the start but these batteries worked so well that I had no need for the OEM at all.I have sent qcell customer service my story and am hoping that they do the right thing and help their customers. I will report back once I hear back from them, and hopefully be able to give them a five star rating.*UPDATE*Completely forgot about this. So customer service was pretty great and ended up sending me two new chargers. I was pretty happy but I must admit one of then again already stopped working. I'm using the third one right now and hoping it'll last.The product is good, but and customer service is pretty good, but but these chargers are very poorly built. I'd rate of a 4 still though because of them trying so hard to fix it.*UPDATE*</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006SK5FYM" id="B006SK5FYM-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-08:</strong> I got a bit more than what I was expecting from this batter.

The battery reports that it has 74% of its capacity left.I do not usually leave all of the wireless and GPS services on, but I wanted to stress the battery and see the results.I have cruised the internet, checked maps and location, checked several dozen emails and texted several messages, while my email synchronized every 30 minutes for 5 different email accounts.Bottom line: this battery works as advertised.  My standard battery would have had less than 20% capacity by this time, under a similar load/use.For those folks who report that the battery does not work as advertised, I would offer two suggestions:1. Check the Task Manager several times during the day (if one is not pre-installed on your phone, get one from the Google Play Store). I ordered this battery because I thought my original battery was failing. By checking Task Manager, I discovered that I had 3 emails in my outbox that the phone kept trying to send, but couldn't because the videos attached to them were too big for the standard email client to send.  So, the phone was burning up juice constantly trying to send emails.  Other apps can cause similar problems and the best way to catch them is to check the task manager and identify which apps are running and using what resources.2. Or....assume you got a "bad battery". It happens. Return the battery for an exchange and try again.  If it still won't work, there is a possibility that your charger is bad.  If you have another charger....try that.One other note: QCell's web site is so-so.  Whenever I see text boxes with "Lorem Ipsum...." in them, it means the manufacturer has used a template to build their web site, but has not fully populated it with information.

I have 3XL hands so the added size and weight associated with the extended battery and case actually made the S3 better for me.My gripe is the cheap back cover.  Since the extended battery is larger, there ends up that there is a void between the cover and the bottom portion of the phone. The cover should be more robust or there should be some sort of internal cross section to offer more rigidity. My cover cracked at the opening for the charger.  I have seen that in reviews of other types of extended batteries.The seller is less than responsive.

With moderate use throughout any given day, I noticed that my stock battery would be almost dead by the end of the day. I was going to buy an extended battery some time ago, but I could never find one with a white back panel, so I was happy to locate this item!The items themselves are great for the price! The white back panel almost matches perfectly. I say almost because the texture of the phone is different than the panel and the white coloring is off just a tiny bit. These two factors are NOT reasons to skip this item, but I thought I'd mention it. The instructions for using this battery say that you should charge it fully and dis-charge fully 5 to 6 times so you can get the most out of it. I did just that and everything is working fine. I went from having to charging my phone throughout the day to being able to almost go 2 full days without a single charge!! I charge my phone every night while I'm sleeping anyway, so I was never too concerned with having a dead phone, but having this extra life allows me to use my 4G service all day long without worrying about how much power I have left.As you would imagine, the one downside with having an extended battery is that it sticks out quite a bit. This item retains 5 stars in my opinion because this extra weight and size is just a reality. While I love that the Samsung Galaxy S II is a very thin phone, I actually like the extra thickness because it adds some more grip to the phone. The extra weight is not even noticeable after a couple of days use.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006SK5FYM" id="B006SK5FYM-review23" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-02:</strong> 1 of the batteries lasts almost as long as the stock one. The other battery doesn't last as long but it is decent. The charger is nice but is only 350ma. Which is way less than even the low power USB standard of 500ma.

The best I ever got after self calibration was about 2600mAh. Over the last week I have seen that drop a little each day. I am now down to 1950 mAh.The replacement battery cover plate fits well. The bulge is not something that bothers me much. The weight increase is minimal.I ended up returning this battery. Once the mAh dropped under 2000 I just could not justify having the bulge out the back and not getting the additional 1600 (almost another full stock battery) with of life that I should be.

I have charged and used both batteries that came with the charging unit twice now. And I honestly cannot tell the difference between the OEM battery that came with the S3. The batteries appear to be well made and fit perfectly in the phone. I am unable to test the NFC capabilities at this point, so I cannot comment on NFC. My small beef comes with the charger - it takes forever to charge the batteries. I started charging a battery this morning around 8:30AM and it didn't finish until 2:00-2:30 PM. The charger will start out with a pink glow, telling you that that battery is charging. As it gets closer to a full charge, the charger will turn purple and finally blue. Blue means that the battery has fully charged. It can take a good 6 hours to charge your battery, so be prepared to wait. But the good thing is that you will receive two batteries, which should give you a total of 3 batteries (including the OEM). I will never run out of power for my cell phone. The only thing I really want to test is the longevity of these batteries. Will they last 3 months? A whole year? I am hoping to get 2 years worth of use out of them, but we shall see. Perhaps I will update my review in a couple more months to let everyone know how they are still holding up. I am removing one star because the charger is pretty basic and takes forever to charge. I also kind of wish that the charger light were a bit dimmer. I feel like I am raving in my office cube.***UPDATE***The charger has just broken. The charger is very cheap and one of the charging pins has fallen into the device. It no longer can charge batteries.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006SK5FYM" id="B006SK5FYM-review33" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-07:</strong> It works as advertised.

With this battery, I've overclocked my phone a bit, I leave wifi and BT on all the time, and I get about 3 days. I got more like 4 days with the initial charge, and I drained it fully a few times as it claims is necessary (which I highly doubt has anything to do with the battery but more to calibrate the phone). I think my phone just doesn't charge it up all the way compared to the initial charge, which is slightly disappointing, but it's still a good improvement. The phone is definitely noticeably fatter, but I have no more trouble pulling it out of my pocket and it still feels similar when I hold it. I use this battery with the Trexcell case. I did not have to cut anything for the battery to fit that case (though I did have to cut larger holes for wires).Update: I just got a new phone a couple weeks ago, but I thought I'd update this review to mention that this battery was still working well at that point, with about 6 months of use on it.

The batteries do indeed have NFC just as the OEM batteries, and I use NFC daily.  They fit exactly as the OEM batteries and seem to have similar battery life.  I can't quantify it, but I don't notice a difference on battery life whether using the original battery or the Qcell, in fact, I usually don't know/remember which battery I have in the phone unless I look.  I would say 2300mAh is probably not accurate, I would say they are probably 2100mAh, same as the stock battery.The charger does take a long time to charge the batteries, about 8 hours from 10% to 100%, but it does charge the batteries completely.  There are no instructions in the package, and they are just in plain boxes.  I did find the the charger LED is purple while charging, and turns blue when the battery is fully charged.  The wall charger has a USB out to allow you to use a usb/micro-usb to charge your phone directly, however based on how long it takes to charge the spare battery in the charger, I haven't tried to charge a phone directly, seems like it would take forever.Overall, I think this is a great value for $25.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006SK5FYM" id="B006SK5FYM-review51" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-10:</strong> This battery has truly helped me.

So far it's acted like it's snug so I can't downgrade my review of the product for that. The provided cover is probably the thinnest/flimsiest plastic I've ever seen (almost more flimsy than the original battery cover on the GNEX).I wish i had paid attention to the fact that this battery is NOT NFC compatible. So if that's important/necessary to you, then don't purchase this.

I even bought another battery 1900mah Anker that worked very well.But one day enable the data plan and I only dur .... 7 hours! amazing even with 2 batteries barely reached the whole day ... and that worried me a lot.Looking for a solution I found a $ 6 battery GTmax, the pedi and I came damaged.I found this battery QCell and cost me $ 18, but three times before my situation had to change my phone or ask for another with more durability.1.Quality: Excellent. It looks much more expensive. Very well sealed without smells to chemicals and in perfect condition. Case fit perfectly.2. Shipping: Fast, small box perfect for  the size of the product.3. Duration: Amazing, Awesome. I turn on my phone at 6 in the morning, is active only use 3G mobile networks and H +, and at 10 pm I got home that I still have 45-40%!! and now I use it much more than before, now I connect to internet on the bus, in the cafeteria, I think in total about 2 hours a day and always active data and the display at 100%, 3 hours of FM radio, 2 Hours of talking with my girlfriend and 1 hour listening music. The first 2 days the battery does not last long, but with  the third charge begins to give all his power!.Honestly is the best product I've bought in years and the brand QCell I found the best in its genre.Very recommended and thanks for creating this product QCell and save me from changing my phone!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006SK5FYM" id="B006SK5FYM-review74" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-04:</strong> Doesn't come with instructions for proper charging techniques to maximize battery life; I had to find them on another website.Alas, I wasted my time in that because when I put the battery in and tried charging it up, my phone didn't register it and there was no charge.

It's become a personal project of mine since the last QCell battery I got had plastic spacers inside where other batteries had battery. I'm glad to report that this battery appears to be legitimate.I'm kind of surprised and concerned to see that I'm the first verified reviewer for this battery.  All the other reviewers came out of the woodwork making their first reviews on amazon for a product they got elsewhere...I've included a chart from my test results comparing the Hyperion and QCell batteries in my first comment - and they're practically equal.  QCell delivers about 3200mAh per battery with a 500mA load.  With a higher load of 2000mA, the rating would be about 3125mAh capacity.The included charger has a usb charging port and is no worse or better than any other brand's included charger -- or any of the GS3's chargers. It appears to be the same as the GS3 charger, but with the prongs rotated counter-clockwise 90 degrees so the battery sticks out to the right. This means that it's slow as ever - and will take longer to charge than a GS3 battery because the battery has higher capacity.This battery delivers what it promises, but I'm concerned about the number of first time reviewers that just had to comment on how great the battery is.  Based on battery capacity alone, I would recommend it.Based on the practices of QCell I have seen: small cells in batteries and filling the space with plastic, campaign downvoting of negative reviews and revealing customer pictures, spamming the customer images to hide revealing photos, putting sockpuppet 1-star first-review reviews on competitors products, putting positive sockpuppet 5-star first-review reviews on their products, I would never recommend a QCell product.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006SK5FYM" id="B006SK5FYM-review86" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-28:</strong> When I first got this unit I charged the two batteries that came with it and it took over 8 hours each.When I placed the Samsung battery that came with my phone in it, it was a very tight fit and broke one of the plastic tabs on the unit.These batteries caused my phone to re-boot randomly, so I no longer use them.I do not recommend this unit.

A local tech recommended that I try the QCell as he said it would solve my problem.  Boy was he right!!!  It is a thicker more heavy duty battery & it comes with a compatible dark charcoal grey battery cover that looks attractive with my black phone.I'm on the phone a lot & I have numerous games that I like to play.  In place of charging my phone 3-4 times a day, I charge it once at night while I'm sleeping.  I've been impressed with how durable this battery is.  With the smaller battery, I was seeing a rapid discharge rate by now.  The QCell just keeps on going & going on one overnight charge!!!  With the additional thickness, it doesn't fit in a regular leather case; however, it does still fit in my holster.  It doesn't fit in my wall charger, but charges well with my wall micro charger.  So the 2 little drawbacks do NOT outweigh the benefits I've received from this battery.

So far the batteries perform at the OEM level and last me the entire day with easily 60-70% of the battery remaining at the end of the night. I would say that I'm a pretty heavy user, playing games and downloading files throughout the day. The battery fits perfectly into the back of the phone, so there is no need for a different back plate. I love the fact that it came with a battery charger. The great part about the charger is that it also has a USB female connector so that you can put your micro-usb cord and charge your phone directly.One thing I like about the Qcell brand is that they are a Canadian company. I wish I knew of an American company that produce quality after market batteries, but there are none, so I will stick with them until then.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006SK5FYM" id="B006SK5FYM-review90" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-02:</strong> Not much to say about this.

The end cover opposite of the charging side of the battery is loosely glued on there. It came lose and broke off within weeks of me using it. I didn&#8217;t think much of it but than after using it for a while I noticed that my phone would shut off for no reason when it was in my pocket. I notice that this only happens when I have the Qcell battery in but no issues with the Samsung batteries. I discover that without that end cover there was too much play room for the battery to slide forward therefore not maintaining the contact with the electrical connection ports. I found that if I put something thin and solid on the opposite end that would be enough for the battery to maintain contact with the terminal of the phone. But this is bad quality and I hope maybe the manufacturer will read this and FIX it and maybe send me a better one.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006SK5FYM" id="B006SK5FYM-review99" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-07:</strong> Update 4/16/13:After 10 days of battery conditioning and 2 extra days of battery discharge monitoring, I find that daily battery life has improved since my last post on day 5, 4/16/13. Not by much though, but it will do.  A full charge lasts me 13-16 hours, granted I leave the battery charged for about 3 hours after 100% is reached. The following are my daily monitoring results...Day 1 = 16 hrsDay 2 = 14 hrsDay 3 = 12 hrsDay 4 = 12 hrsDay 5 = 14 hrsDay 6 = 14 hrsDay 7 = 14 hrsDay 8 = 13.5 hrsDay 9 = 14 hrsDay 10 = 15.5 hrsDay 11 = 13 hrsDay 12 = 16 hrsFrom the results I got on this little test, I found that the hype made by other consumers on this product, is not quite as I hoped it would turn out to be for me. But, hey, knowing the security of going all day without having to charge my cell phone, is a-ok in my books. I am upgrading my rating to 5 stars (from 3 stars on last post).Just an addendum, I believe that the longer you leave it charged after 100% is reached the longer the battery life will be.4/7/13:I am currently on day 5 of "battery conditioning" since initial charge of 9 hours, as per box instruction.After the initial charge, day 1, I got about 16 hours of use (data/mobile) to full discharge. Day 2, 14 hours. Day 3, 12 hours. Day 4, almost 12 hours. It appears to be holding up less and less as days go by.Someone had mention in one of the customer reviews that he/she had a problem with the Qcell battery only holding charge as long as the stock (original) battery after 3 days of conditioning, but that he/she had "stuck with it". And within about a week, it was discharging about as he/she was expecting it to, and had no issues since. I am going through the same phase now. I will update once I finish the recommended 6x (or on rare occasion 8-10) of full recharge/discharge on the new battery to achieve maximum capacity. 3 stars for now.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006SK5FYM" id="B006SK5FYM-review100" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-08:</strong> I have bought 2 sets of these batteries and they have both been great great.

This isn't an issue with the QCell battery so I already like it more. The external charger is kind of cheap but works great so I have no complaints. Keep in mind that most external chargers charge very slowly but that helps extend the life of the battery so that's fine with me. I'm considering returning the Ankers and buying another one of these. I'll update if I have any issues or follow-up comments.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006SK5FYM" id="B006SK5FYM-review104" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-24:</strong> Quick and easy review: Great battery for my Samsung Galaxy S3.A little better than the original battery and is NFC. compatibile!I did try the NFC and it works great!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006SK5FYM" id="B006SK5FYM-review105" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-21:</strong> I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONW WITH A NOTE 2. THE BATTERY LIFE ON THE OEM IS PRETTY GOOD BUT THIS BATTERY IS A LITTLE BIT BETTER. THIS WOULD BE A FIVE STAR RATING IF THE BATTERY FITTED LIKE THE OEM. DONT GET ME WRONG THE BATTERY FITS IN THE PHONE BUT IT DOES NOT STAY IN WITHOUT THE BACK ON TEH PHONE THERE FOR MEANING WHEN YOU TRY TO PUT IT IN A CASE YOU CAN NOT FLIP IT OVER WITH THE SCREEN FACING NORTH TO PUT THE CASE ON YOU HAVE TO PUT THE CASE ON FIST OR THE BACK WHILE HOLDINGTHE BATTERY IN. ITS NOT A SNUG FIT. THE BATTERY LIFE IS AWSOM. I DID A TEST OF TEH BATTERY I USED IT HEAVELY CASUE I HAD JUST GOT THE PHONE AND WAS ON IT FOR ALMOST 8 HOURS STR8 AND WAS STILL AT 48%. NEVER PUT IT ON CHARGER FOR THE FOLLOWING DAY AND BY THE END OF DAY TWO THE BATTERY WAS AT 22%. I USE MY PHONE ALLDAY EVERYDAY AND HAVING TWO BATTERIES IS AWSOM.

IT LIGHTS UP THE WHOLE ROOM ADN I NEED COMPLETE DARKNESS.

Having an extra battery is great but the OEM battery on the Note II lasts long enough for me to easily make it home every night and I often find myself intentionally draining the battery to recharge at a lower percentage than 30-40%.  These batteries work fine and seem to have a charge close to the OEM batteries, but wouldn't say that it lasts longer.  The plug-in charger takes a longer time to recharge than the OEM charger.  These are a good alternative to the OEM battery and is much cheaper.  My recommendation is that you only buy one, because one spare is plenty with how long these batteries last.  Rarely will you need two spare batteries, unless you regularly find yourself in places where without power for 3+ days.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006SK5FYM" id="B006SK5FYM-review111" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-21:</strong> This is the best purchase from my phone that I've gotten besides the phone itself.

I could probably go 2 days between charges, but I really just wanted a battery to get me through the whole day.  Took about 2 cycles to fully realize its capacity.  The battery door that comes with it is well color matched to the rest of the phone, has a nice rubberized texture on it, and is even a bit easier to install than the OEM door.

That means no disconnecting the cable, etc. You don't have to do this every time you charge your phone, but you do want to for the INITIAL charge.So then after it was fully charged I disconnected my phone and used my phone as normal.As a trial run, I wanted to see how it would last on a full charge so I avoiding charging my phone.It lasted 2 days and 20 hours before it got down to 2% battery. If that isn't amazing...I HIGHLY recommend this battery. It does make the phone a little heavier/bulkier, but I'm not that obsessive about how my phone looks and I really don't think it's that noticeable anyway.

It was never that good to start with.  Now that I have this battery, I can go two days or more without charging if I have to, and this is with bluetooth and wifi turned on and doing some moderate email, facebook and web.  I don't use my GPS unless plugged in because I have found the GPS on the S2 to be the most power hungry function of the whole phone.  In the car I have watched the battery drain with the GPS turned on even with the phone plugged into a .5 amp car charger. I had to upgrade to a 2 amp charger so I could use my phone for GPS navigation while in the car.  So, I don't know how long the battery would last with the GPS turned on while not plugged in, but I would hope you might get 4 to 5 hours if you turned bluetooth and wifi off.  Just a guess here.The only thing that I don't like about having this battery is that I can no longer use a protective case for the phone and the new back that comes with this battery is slippery as cat snot and my phone falls out a lot (I keep it in my shirt pocket).

It doesn't want to die.This is the only battery you will ever need. The only downside is that none of the cases for the Galaxy S2 will fit. I might be able to find a leather pouch case I can use.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006SK5FYM" id="B006SK5FYM-review145" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-03:</strong> very good quality battery, cant notice the diff between original and these ones in terms of duration.So far both are good, charger is slow, overnight usage only, but if you use the USB port, it will charge cellphone rly fast.Wont charge battery and cellphone at the same time i think, or will do it at a slower rate, if you got USB port and battery chargin the color of the led will change.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006SK5FYM" id="B006SK5FYM-review146" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-09-14:</strong> As other reviews say the charger is quite slow, but the batteries are almost as good as the original that came with the phone.

So now onto the review.Like a lot of people I upgraded from the Galaxy S3 to the Galaxy S4 and love the extra battery life that the S4 offers. But it didn't take long for me to wish that I had even more life before needing to charge my phone. I tried the Anker 2600 with NFC, and it ended up being the battery I use the most, but there is only so much MAH capacity that can be squeezed into a slim battery. So this is where the super 7600 Anker battery combo comes in. This 7600 is close to 3 times the mah of the standard 2600, and it shows in the times it lasts. I'll get to the tests I ran a little later, but I wanted to start with the packaging.If you have ordered other Anker products of this size the packaging will look familiar. It comes in a black box with Chrome writing, with features and Ankers contact info on the bottom. After opening it you will see the 5000mah case and battery combo in whatever color you ordered. I received the white one to match my White S4, but it also comes in black.Anker 7600mAh Extended Battery Case for Samsung Galaxy S4, GT-I9505, SGH-I337(AT&T;), SGH-M919(T-Mobile), not NFC capable [18-Month Warranty]. The 5000mah battery is actually built into the case/ battery door. It has a nice felt layer on the inside with 2 gold plated pins that connect to the included 2600mah batteries gold contacts. These 2 together is where you get the 7600mah capacity. You can use the included 2600mah battery by itself, but Anker doesn't recommend it because it might speed up oxidation of the batteries contacts if used without the 5000mah case. Also in the box is the instruction manual, and other various Anker papers. I have added several pics to the customer images section for reference. There are new pics added by Anker also that illustrate how the 2 batteries/ case connect.Now the install is very easy. You just put the 2600mah battery in like you would your stock battery, and the the 5000mah case goes on by putting the side of the phone with the volume rocker in first at an angle, and then pressing the side with the power button down until it clicks into place. The fitment of the case is perfect. I've noticed no gaps, or issues with covering ports or buttons. Charging is the same method as charging your stock battery, and to my surprise it doesn't take that much longer. After charging my stock Samsung battery and the Anker 7600 to full I ran some head to head tests just to see how much longer it lasts, and it didn't disappoint.I set up my test as follows. I set full 100% brightness on the device, and then I used an older version of the MX player app that has the option to repeat a movie once it finishes. I also set the app itself to 100% brightness, with the "keep screen on" option ticked. I then run a full HD movie (think tall blue aliens) in repeat and then record how long each battery lasts. Here are the results:Stock Samsung 2600mah Battery:  Ran 6 hours and 38 minutes.Anker 7600mah Battery Combo:  Ran 14 hours and 9 minutes.If my math is correct that's a difference of 7 hours and 31 minutes. That's more than double the time the stock Samsung battery lasts. Now I know this isn't how most people are using their phones, but it was just a test I wanted to do out of curiosity, and to show that it definitely lasts a lot longer. You will notice a huge jump in how long it lasts. With even heavy use I doubt you would need to charge after a full days use. Now of course it adds bulk, but that's just unavoidable if you want to add a significant amount of battery life.If you are looking to get a huge bump in your Galaxy S4's battery life I highly recommend the Anker 7600mah Battery combo. And to end the review Ive said it before and Ill say it again, Anker has some of the best customer service I have ever experienced.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EN73M4C" id="B00EN73M4C-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-28:</strong> Battery life will last a little over 2 days with heavy usage.Sacrifices size and nfc but well worth the battery life.Very comfortable designed very well to fit in hand.Phone fits securely inside battery case.Easily accessible volume power buttons.Clearance for IR and speaker is great.Durable plastic.

The fact that the battery case makes my phone a little bit heavier makes me feel more secure about holding it. It makes me feel like the phone is sturdier and won't slip out of my hand. Also, when people looked at my phone, they couldn't tell that there was an extended battery case on it either. That's how slick it looks on my phone.The performance on this case is great. I can use my phone for at least a day and a half and still have batter life on it. This includes listening to pandora, using the GPS, texting, Instagram, and using Snapchat. This was all done on one charge. Now, I don't have to worry about bringing my outlet charger wherever I go. this case has really made my phone more reliable on long days.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EN73M4C" id="B00EN73M4C-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-09:</strong> I have a Samsung S4 AT&T; I337. Received my Anker S-View flip and Anker 7600mah extended battery case a day early. I noticed when I put the S4 into the case, it felt as if I was going to crack the sides of the phone. I noticed when removing the phone that it marks the sides due to its tight fit. It is definitely secure and big, but what do you expect for hours of battery life. After holding it for awhile its not as heavy and bulky as anticipated. Biggest issue that others have mentioned is that the back housing is notorious for fingerprint and smudging. It also looks like it will scratch easily. Hope Anker will provide replacement batteries for this case as well as the Anker S-View I purchased since they have the special pin set on the back.All in all I will test the battery and see how well it holds. Will update my review then.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EN73M4C" id="B00EN73M4C-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-29:</strong> It's midday Tuesday and I've been running on battery since Saturday morning at 7am.  Currently I'm at 40% battery remaining.  Normally after the end of a single work day I'm at 38-40%.  This is GREAT, and on those nights when work extends much later than expected this is going to be a lifesaver, since that's when I'm stuck somewhere troubleshooting something and my phone is essential.This unit consists of a replacement battery and a replacement back that contains another battery.  The replacement internal battery has two contacts on it that mate with the replacement back cover to provide the 7600ma total capacity.  It does substantially increase the thickness of the phone, but for me it feels good.  I like the additional thickness especially for single handed hand use.  At this time of year I'm putting my phone in my coat pocket rather than pants pocket anyway. The rounded and beveled edges of the case feel good in the palm.This will vary by user, but the only thing I would change is to add a couple of small strips of rubber grippy material to the side edges, as the case is really slick and smooth.  I'm planning on doing that soon.Addendum:  By the end of day Tuesday I was at 36 percent battery, and that was after letting the OTA 4.3 upgrade happen from Verizon then tweaking, downloading app upgrades etc.  So, pretty heavy usage over the afternoon.  I'm even more impressed by the battery life now.Addendum 2:  I used this:B00ATH0KEAand put some strips at strategic points on the case according to how I hold it.  Feels really good now.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EN73M4C" id="B00EN73M4C-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-16:</strong> Product exterior - adds quite significant thickness. Overall 11/16" thick at thickest point with the phone compared to 7/16" of myAcase Samsung Galaxy S4 case - Superleggera PRO Dual Layer Protection case for AT&T;, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon Galaxy S IV Galaxy SIV i9500 (Black/Grey)(Galaxy S4, Black). Makes phone feel solid, psychologically makes one less likely to drop phone. Black glossy plastic finish gets fingerprints too easily. Deep hole for speaker on back makes it quite noticeable but I was pleasantly surprised that even if blocked it was designed to still allow music through somehow nicely. Battery is 2 parts, a detachable battery (without NFC) that is required because of the customized pins in front that attach to the second nondetachable battery (it is built into the case and almost impossible to charge by itself unless you wire it yourself, so stick with using this case and charging traditionally with cable). Inside of this nondetachable battery case is a nice cloth fabric that is soft and doesn't get dirty.  Both the Volume buttons and Power button are very easy to get to.Description of use - easy to install, simply turn off phone, take off battery cover and battery and keep them somewhere safe, put on first battery, then clip on the extended battery. Charge it for a few hours over 100% the first time.  Battery life is significantly better.  I have done quite a few tests, here are the main results.First, let me state my parameters:  I am using stock rooted Touchwiz and if you drag the Notification bar down with two fingers you'll see all the settings. Wi-Fi, GPS, Mobile data, Sound, Sync, Air gesture, Air view, Smart stay and Screen Rotation - these were All On the entire period.  Bluetooth was on sometimes for several hours.  All others were off.  Also keep in mind I have a few apps tweaking battery usage here, the most notable are SnapDragon's BatteryGuru app, Backitude (which is a very smart GPS controlling battery efficiency app so GPS is 'off' when on Wifi), and also Voltage Control with OnDemand mode.After charging to 100% and leaving it in 1900mA Charger for a few hours.  I managed to get 9h 14m from 100% to 87%.  I then got a total of 19h 12m when I was at 75%.  I eventually reach 1% at 2days 3hours 22minutes and 44seconds.  I then immediately put it in 1900mAh stock Charger and monitored charging time from 1% to 75% to be 108minutes, continuing there from 75% to 94% taking 78minutes and from 94% to 100% taking 26 minutes.Keep in Mind - Stock Charger and Cable are preferred for fastest charging times.  The last 10% usually takes longer.  In Summary I got 2 Days 3 Hours 22 Minutes of Battery from 100% to 1%.  And it took 212 Minutes (about 3.5 Hours) to charge from 1% to 100%.Also if you're curious on my most heavily used Apps in battery consumption in order of most to least are: Google Services, Screen, Device Idle, Clash of Clans, Android OS, SleepBot, Voice Calls.There is one noticeable con and that is the delay in Battery response to the phone.  So sometimes if playing a game you'll notice battery life dropping and then increasing spontaneously as it doesn't expect you to have such a large battery.  Luckily it still reports fairly accurately (just delayed) but you will notice this on my Battery Screenshots.Ideal users - if you don't mind a thicker build and do Not want to carry any extra batteries with you for those emergencies, then this case is for you.Overall quite satisfied with this product for worry-free battery survival on a great device.I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EN73M4C" id="B00EN73M4C-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-19:</strong> Ok, let me start off by saying it's a great battery. It is however WAY TOO Slippery. I could easily drop the phone. I will try a few fixes. Sticky tape or sticky spray. I have not used it yet because of the slippery issue, except to test. Hard plastic and big (to be expected), but I could easily see a disaster coming if dropped. I bought a Zero Lemon Extended Battery here a good while ago. I think it is 7600mAh as well. It came with a rubber case that protects the edges of the phone as well as the back. Anker needs to address this issue. The back is sooo big I cannot find a protective rubber case. I purchased &#34;eGrips&#34; on eBay and waiting to see if that will help. I'll have a white phone and camo grips (only one I could find in stock anywhere). Won't be pretty, but will help.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00EN73M4C', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00EN73M4C', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B009GS5ME6</h2>    <p class="price"> $B009GS5ME6</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009GS5ME6" id="B009GS5ME6-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-05:</strong> Great price, decent protection.

The different sizes and colors make this a great choice for both devices and the eraser/bubble type head works smoothly across the screen without the need for any pressure to be applied while using.  The writing ability is pretty sharp, but you're not going to get the feel of pinpoint precision with so much of the stylus surface touching the screen, however, it takes only a couple of minutes to get used to it.The short stylus is about an inch and a half long and has grooves in the stem to make the grip easier. It also has an attachment string that can be inserted into the headset hole for convenience.  The longer stylus is a smooth metallic finish and can be slippery when writing.  What would make these perfect, is if the longer stylus had some sort of grip to give it more of a pen feel.

Comes with 2 lanyards with plastic adapters that you can safely plug into the phono jack on your phone if you tend to lose track of your stylus.The responsiveness of the stylus on my smartphone and 10&#34; tablet is as good or better than more expensive styli from the manufacturer and third party suppliers that charge $20-$40 for fancier and heavier styli.I have large hands and assumed that a full size stylus...like a normal ink pen...with some weight to it, would be the best choice.These styli are shorter and made of a much lighter grade of metal: having used them for months now, I prefer them over the heavier, full sized ones.  They also fit nicely in a wide range of pockets.They were delivered as promised and have exceeded my expectations.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00752D972" id="B00752D972-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-10:</strong> These stylus have been great to use.

I ordered mine in the beginning of April and have only had to open one! This includes my daily use as well as use from a 4 year old and a few of my students (who are lovely, but not the kindest when it comes to things like this haha). The tips are different sizes, but they appear to be that way in the pictures so I don't see what the issue is (I feel they have different uses but I'm not sure, I don't do anything too fancy). So far the only problem has been that the paint on the clip has come off but it still works as a clip so it's just a vanity thing. I would definitely recommend these!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00752D972" id="B00752D972-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-15:</strong> Okay...why would anyone pay $15/$20 for a tablet stylus when you get 14 of these for dirt cheap?

If, like me, you have children who like gadgets and techno stuff, then these are perfect, as they come in a variety of colours. Within one minute of opening the pack my daughter had taken three out to use: pink, yellow and blue and she purred with delight at the glossy colours. She reported back to me that they are very good and easy to use, with no obvious drawbacks. I must confess that the lanyards confused me somewhat, although my son is wearing one around his wrist, so perhaps that is what they are for? Personally I also liked the little Swedish Friendly cloth, as it cleans both my phone and spectacles, although it was probably not designed for such use. So, to conclude, a great parcel filler for birthdays and Christmas alike for those who are a bit screen heavy.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00752D972" id="B00752D972-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-03:</strong> I was a little leery of ordering so many of these, sight unseen.

There really isn't a lot to know, except that some of the big brands are marketing their pens for upwards of $30 each, which is just insane. These do just great!!The small sized pen comes with a little thinga-ma-jig that inserts into your headphone socket to keep your pen at the ready. Nicely done!The package also included a cute little microfiber cloth, always handy.Bottom line: if you want a pen for your phone or tablet, just get this. Pick a few colors you like.

This bundle is even more of a remarkable bargain as the pack contains 45 styluses as well as 20 lanyards which we certainly find useful as they make the pens less likely to go `missing in action' around the house.This bundle consists of 5 each in nine attractive colours. Also included is a small cleaning cloth, presumably for your screen. I have been using one of them to play a quiz game on my iPad where you are pitched against another player and speed is essential. I found that it operated perfectly in producing an immediate response when touched to the screen. Although touch styluses do not have an indefinite life, the one I have been using for some weeks is showing no signs of deterioration.This is a large enough pack to keep you, your family and probably your friends too going for quite some while if not indefinitely! Highly recommended in action and at this price an absolute bargain.Note - this review was written about the bundle of 45, but Amazon have also posted it on other Friendly Swede bundles with a different make up.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00752D972" id="B00752D972-review19" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-04-05:</strong> The whole family use these for draw something and we all like them.

They work great and seem very durable. They have a sturdy clip for clipping on the side of your tablet case and even come with a dongle you can plug into your phone or tablet. They come in an assortment of fun colors. Each stylus is individually wrapped so you can keep some for yourself and give a few away for small gifts.

I was prepared for a repeat performance with this set, but was VERY PLEASANTLY SURPRISED!!  The Friendly Swede Stylus Set feels heavier in your hand, the colors are vibrant, and the variety is fantastic!  I brought them to a gathering with a few friends and everyone got the color (and style, small with the plug that goes into the headphone slot, or the larger type with the clip) that they wanted.  I tell everyone about these, I've shared with friends and my sons, and I still have several to spare.  You WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED with this purchase!! As a bonus, you get a cleaning cloth (yes, it actually works!), and lanyards!  The whole set comes well packaged in a resealable case.  When I change my iPad mini (or iPhone 5) cases, I pick a stylus that matches the new case, and put the old one in the handy case (sliding the stylus right back into the wrapper that the new one came out of first!).  Don't miss this deal!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00752D972" id="B00752D972-review63" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-20:</strong> These did the job, I with there would have been more larger pen size ones, the little ones are a little annoying</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00752D972" id="B00752D972-review64" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-16:</strong> I purchased a pack of these stylus' for my family to replace some iFrogs brand ones.

The order arrived on time and nicely packaged.  Included with the stylus' was two long tethers and a screen cleaning cloth.  I've since made a repeat order to hand out to friends.I use mine to take notes for school in the paper 53 app, play draw something, monopoly, temple run, and lots of other games.

I use these on my Kindle Fire and Galaxy SII Smart Phone (I'm all thumbs when texting) and buy them here. Do not spend more elsewhere for supposedly better stylus' - there aren't any. These are the ones you need and you cannot beat this price. They are lightweight with bright reflective colors making them very easy to keep track of, and the shape and size are like using a pen (I have one of the shorties got elsewhere and never use it, it's uncomfortable) and fit my hand very comfortably. When not in use, the clip allows it to be kept attached to your tablet (Kindle) or cell case, if you have a case with a cover - otherwise it will also stay put in a pocket. Buying in this quantity set allows me to share some with friends. Once they see me use it they want one.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00752D972" id="B00752D972-review69" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-18:</strong> I love these stylus! so do my friends.

I carry one of the two-inch styluses loose in my purse's inner pocket, and attach it to the phone with the plastic headphone plug for times I know I'll use it a bit. I'm using the styluses on a Galaxy S5 (all needs where fingertips would be required) and on an iPad Air (mostly for scrolling, selecting using the keyboard, some PicsArt app needs).Having a fat (normal for a stylus) rubber tip, there isn't a lot of precision, but the response time has been pretty fast. Maybe not quite as fast as finger tip. Compared to my two other rubber tip styluses, a Boxwave and a Griffen, I like the Friendly Swede at least as much. In cost comparison, Friendly Swede wins.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00752D972" id="B00752D972-review79" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-16:</strong> They were all so awesome and I had fun sharing them with friends and family.

I am forever losing them around the house because if I am not on my smartphone, my Kindle Paperwhite my Kindle Fire 2, I am probably on my Kindle Fire Tablet and every one of these uses a stylus (yes I DO know about using your fingers, but I feel I have more accuracy using a stylus. Eventually they sometimes find their way back to me (if no one else swipes them first!I had been buying one or two stylus here and there, but I eventually was down to my last one. This is a really nice collection of 18 different color stylus and they are as colorful as the pictures. They have a nice solid feel, unlike so many that I have purchased. Believe me, some just feel "cheap"but these feel more substancial and the rubber on the ones that I have used, works well. Best of all I have paid more for 2 or 3 stylus than I paid for all EIGHTEEN of these. As an added bonus, Included are detachable "Tether Strings/Lanyards," which attach one end to a small hole at the very top of the stylus and on the other end is a plug that you can plug into the earphone jack (it is not permanent) and you can remove it from the jack whenever you need it. Also included is a Microfiber cloth to keep your touch screen clean and they arrive packaged in a zip closed pouch to keep them all together. I have sure that if you have any problem and contact "The Friendly Swede (love that name), they will give you 100% satisfaction.I will be in hospital next week for knee replacement surgery followed by a longer stay in a orthopedic inpatient rehab for a few weeks, so with this package I will have all the stylus I need and the tethers might keep the stylus off of the floor.I would recommend this set.

One note of caution, you have to put the ring and lanyard, you receive two of them, on the end of the stylus, it is not hard but not easy. The lanyard is about two feet long and plugs into the earphone jack. My wife said on her original iPad that when she did that, her speakers did not work, I don't use an iPad so I don't know.So one tip for the manufacturers, make the ring easier to get in and out of the hole on the end of the stylus</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00752D972" id="B00752D972-review92" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-31:</strong> I purchased this fun packet of 14 styli to replace my one $20 TouchTec II stylus (which doubles as a pen) often borrowed by my husband.

She told me she had purchased it for her smart phone but found that it also worked for her Kindle. She paid $10 for just one.

They have a soft foam tip, and it only requires a very light touch to navigate on the screen.  I prefer the full size stylus, but they also include some shorter ones in the package.  There is a color to suit anyone, and there are enough here to share.  I gave matching long and short stylus pens to my granddaughter for her Ipod, my grandson for his Nintendo DS, and my daughter for her smart phone.

I was satisfied with it until one day I misplaced it. So coming back to Amazon to buy another, I chose to purchase this bundle! What a fantastic deal!! The build of these are equivalent to my misplaced stylus, but now I have plenty of "backups!" I plan on giving some to friends and family. It comes with the two sizes (multi-color), screen cleaning cloth, and the headphone-jack-string-connector (so that it stays connected to your device during transportation).You can't go wrong with this bundle! ;-)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00752D972" id="B00752D972-review100" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-23:</strong> I dont know where to start ok.

But sometimes (and frankly not that often), quantity takes precedence over quality.  I like that these are so cheap and you get so many.  Sure they may not be the most durable, and the chrome paint seems to come off the plastic clip pretty easily, but they work.  I haven't really found a use for the small ones though.  I think next time, I'll order the pack without the minis.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00752D972" id="B00752D972-review102" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-21:</strong> I loved this bundle as did my family.

My pup chewed up 3 $15 stylus' so far.  I went on a search and started to wonder why I paid $15 for one when I found these. Now that I have them - here's the dirt:Let's see - they're short.  This means it barely fits in my hand and you should really hold the stylus upright because the metal around the edge of the tip will scratch or won't allow the movement to occur.Another - they're short.  So the clip on one end jams into the hand at times. And that clip - I'm not sure about other devices but anyone with a kindle fire, inside a "book" sleeve, knows that clip is worthless.  There is no room for anything thinner than a piece of paper.The tips are soft and seem to work fine as long as I hold the pen as noted above.$15 ones are longer, stronger metal, they had a tie and "ball" ornament on the end so the clip wasn't an issue and I did prefer the tip on those....but the taste was phenomenal and the pup really enjoyed them!The pros of this one: They serve the purpose and - 0 yeah ---  Taste doesn't matter to the pup so the price is phenomenal for 9 in a pack!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00752D972" id="B00752D972-review107" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-20:</strong> This is quite a nice stylus set in a wide range of colors that will keep your smartphone or tablet fingerprint free.

These stylus' are more responsive on my Dad's Nokia Lumia 810 than his Targus stylus (that he paid $20 for). You get five, 1.7" stylus' with lanyards already attached and nine, 4.5" stylus' with pocket clips and holes in the end to attach the two elastic 15" lanyards that also come with it. The lanyards can be plugged into the 3.5mm headphone jack so that it can always be attached to your device. My kids love them and they work great on their Nexus 7s. The quality isn't the best though. They feel like thin aluminum. But if you break one, you have 13 more. Will try to post more after my kids abuse them for a while.Update: It has been a couple of days and I have had more time to play with the stylus'. They seem a lot more sturdy that I originally thought. I don't think that anybody that orders these stylus' will be disappointed one bit, especially for the price.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00752D972" id="B00752D972-review110" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-14:</strong> These work great, and there are multiple colors to go with anything.

Oh, and the many positive reviews helped too!  I was a little worried about the rubber tip because the last rubber tipped styli I bought a long time ago stuttered rather than glided across the screen and were just irritating to use.  When these 4 1/2 inch (& the itty bitty) styli arrived and I used one for the first time, I was really surprised at how well they work!  They work JUST as well as some of the more (MUCH more) expensive styli I've purchased in the past.  Unlike those other rubber tipped styli I bought a long time ago, these actually glide quite nicely on my  &#34; i &#34; device screens and on screen covers as well.  The tiny styli have a plastic plug so that you can plug it into your headphone jack so it's always handy.  That'll work for some folks and won't work for others.The one admission I should make is that I really wanted to buy from another seller that sold the 4 1/2&#34; styli for a WHOLE LOT LESS.  The only problem was that they shipped from Hong Kong.  So I ordered these &#34;Prime&#34; styli so I could get them quickly and also ordered 2 packs from Hong Kong.  I needed to have a BUNCH of them because I lose little items like these quick, fast, and in a hurry!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00752D972" id="B00752D972-review122" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-11:</strong> They work perfectly.

I obviously got a bad unit the first time.*UPDATE* This item worked for approximately one week! Only had a single Motorola cell phone charger (that I've been using in various outlets for two+ years with no issue) plugged in to the unit and the socket extender was plugged into a fused 12V "power plug" (NOT a cigarette lighter like on older vehicles) and out of the blue the thing just died. All of the lights went off and NOTHING. I attempted to plug it in to other receptacles (my vehicle has 3 stock) as well as other vehicles....NOTHING. Was a neat little product...for a week. Now I'm using one I paid half as much for at the dollar store! COME ON! :( Garbage. Also, the USB port on my was "ify" at best....when the device worked at all!This product arrived ahead of schedule, well-packaged, and ready to go! I have a number of accessories that I use frequently and this was an add-on to a previously purchased, lower quality socket extender...multiple smart phones, battery chargers, interior lighting, mp3 player, spotlight, heating blanket....Great addition to the road trip ride!PROS: Low profile socket with no lights fits snugly in every socket I have inserted it in360 degree rotation for ease of access to either switches or plugsAbility to easily turn off individual socketsIndividual LED (blue off/red on) indicator lights (and they ALL work, despite some reviews...no LED's are "shared")CONS: Mounting bracket is somewhat flimsy but works well if you aren't too rough on it3M mounting tape, though decent, is still barely adequate unless you're mounting it on glass or the worlds smoothest interior trimNot buying this one prior to the "cheaper" (yet more expensive) socket extender!!!All in all, great product...exactly as advertised...and I assure you, I've tested it to it's limit...and contrary to popular warnings, the low amp draw on the charging system will NOT drain your batter (my car sat for two weeks with both socket extenders connected and lit).

The rings light red when a switch is on and blue when a switch is off ( I though that would have been the opposite but no big deal).The USB port is only a 800mA port, so I would not recommend charging you phone with it, I use it to charge my bluetooth headset and have no issues what so ever.The sticky pad that comes with it is amazing!  It was about 20 degrees out when I stuck this to the metal cabinet inside my van and have had NO issues with it falling off or anything.The biggest complaint I have with this is the power cord is not very long, another foot or so would have been alot better.

I'm hoping that there's something else I can find.The other issue is that I was using this to charge a portable 12v battery.  If I neglected to disconnect that battery, this device would allow power back through itself instead of cutting it off even when I had the switch disengaged.As this is for a vehicle, the manufacturer really needs to address the line noise issue.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004JPD8ZG" id="B004JPD8ZG-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-10:</strong> This is by far the best cigar lighter power supply available.

I was glad to find this one which has on and off for each item. I also like that the whole thing rotates so you can turn it to get to the plugs easier and turn it back so the buttons are on top.The cigarette plug in part seems to be sturdier than my old one. The on off button themselves are somewhat flimsy and I feel could break down the road. Also the high gloss black finish was pretty scuffed up.

That's a lot of driving, especially with a 6-year-old. My Kia Sedona only has two outlets, and that simply isn't enough when you've got a portable DVD player, several iPods, iPhone 4, Nexus, iPad and all their accessories that inevitably need charging on such a long trip. This 4-way extender was a life saver. We had previously been using a power converter that had 4 standard outlets but it was so noisy and the adapters couldn't all fit in it at the same time. The plug eventually broke into pieces and we needed a replacement before our next trip.I was wary given the low price of this extender, but it was one of the best purchases I've ever made on Amazon. It's completely quiet, of course, and significantly cheaper than the converter type extenders. The materials feel a little cheap but it has lasted several 28+ hour journeys with constant use and no issues whatsoever. My only complaints, and they are minor, are that the LED indicators that let you know if a port is on or off seem to have their colors backwards. I would automatically assume that RED means OFF and BLUE means ON. It's actually the opposite and that was a little puzzling at first since your only indication of whether or not a port is on is the LED. Also, I wish there was a less permanent way to mount it. I know with some modification I could make a velcro mount but I really don't want to be sticking any kind of adhesive on my interior. It would be nice if there was an adjustable clip that could be attached to a console or something. This probably won't be an issue for most people as I would imagine most of their traveling would be done in one vehicle, but with business trips and car rentals and such, it would be nice for a more user-friendly option for mounting in several vehicles. Without mounting, the unit has very little weight to it and doesn't stay put with several cords plugged in from different directions.Overall, though, I think it's a very good buy for the price. I spent a lot of time researching similar products to find a solution and I'm glad I chose this one. You will be hard pressed to find this many ports in a quality unit like this.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004JPD8ZG" id="B004JPD8ZG-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-03:</strong> I've used other car sockets but this is a first for me.

I have no ideas if the tape is any good but there is always that 3M double stick that will tear your dashboard off if you try to remove it.One consideration.  Our Fiesta leaves the "Power Port" powered on all the time.  This item has helpful indicator lights on each button.  They are blue or red, but always on.  If your car does not shut off the power port when you remove the key and you don't run it very often, the power drain could impact your battery life.  I'll never know since my wife loves the Fiesta.

Build it tank tough and it won't fit in your pocket, too weak then what is the point.  I had a Samsung Infuse and when it died I moved on to the S4 (which I really love).  My Infuse had a Ballistic case which offered a lot of protection, but so much it interfered with the functionality and ergonomics.  This case is pretty close to striking the balance I want.  First a little about me, I take care of stuff because I am cheap I guess, but I also take my stuff in some pretty bad places.  This phone will be with me when I am cutting firewood or under the house fixing a leak in the water supply. My Infuse died when a Camelbak leaked on it in my backpack while mountain biking, so I need something a little more than a case to protect it while in the boardroom.  This case is a little overkill for that but maybe just a tad shy for mountain biking.  I wish the rubber bumpers were just a little thicker and more cushioned.  The buttons work OK through the case, a little stiff but I like that.  It allows access to the entire screen which is a plus, something the Ballistic + Infuse did not.  I plan to keep it and throw it in a ziplock bag when it may be exposed to abuse.  I got the white for my son and the yellow for me, both look great and very well made.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BWSYF3W" id="B00BWSYF3W-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-29:</strong> This case was so hard to remove from the phone, I returned it.  If you have to struggle that much, you risk dropping or flexing the phone.  It was horrible.  I liked the look, and it was sleek, and seemed to be carefully designed.  I'd say it offered moderate protection, maybe.  If you put a case on the phone and don't take it off, you might be okay, but I change cases all the time for different looks, and change batteries sometimes too.  Way too much trouble for me.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BWSYF3W" id="B00BWSYF3W-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-13:</strong> This is by far the best case I ever brought for a cell phone.

I was looking for something that was protective and with some grip as most other cases I have used on the phone have been very slippery. After having the case on my phone for a few days, these are my pros and cons:Pros:1. The case seems like it would protect the phone very well. I am careful with my phones, but accidents happen and I think this case will protect it well for my needs. The rubber bumpers on the corners are a nice touch.2. The case is slightly grippy, but not as much as I had hoped. The 'rubber' on the sides helps a lot and overall the case is much easier to hang on to than most others I've tried. There is a fine line between grippy enough and too grippy. Not enough and it is slippery - too much and you cannot get the phone in and out of your pocket easily. So far, this case seems like a good combination.3. The case has a high bezel around the front of the phone to protect the screen if it lands or is set on its face.4. The case fits my Galaxy S4 well and all of the ports are accessible.Cons:1. Could be a little grippier, but it's a fine line.2. The case makes the phone significantly bigger, especially in width and thickness.3. The phone in this case will not fit in my iOttie One-touch car mount. I will have to order the XL iOttie.Overall, this is a good case that fits my needs.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BWSYF3W" id="B00BWSYF3W-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-18:</strong> the case is real sturdy I know it will protect my phone.

The S4 phone is big, but very slim and hard to hold for someone with big hands. This case provides a great grip. Feels very secure and super safe. It has for bumpers on the four corners. There is a lip so if you leave it face down the screen will not touch the table. The buttons are responsive. The cutouts for the head phone jack works with my monster cable for my car. The power jack opening works with all of my jacks (the Neo Hybrid only fit the stock charger provided).Only one complaint, the four bumpers on the corners collect dust.

I purchased this case after viewing a youtube video of a guy throwing a Galaxy S3 encased in a Dualtek case across a stone bridge.  Crazy...Here are the pluses:- Super clean plastic molding.  No odd plastic molding pieces anywhere.- Made from very high quality soft touch plastic.- Nice grippy patterns molded to the sides of the case.- Nicely sized lip for screen protection.- Nicely sized cutout for USB port, headphone jack, and microphones.- Funky isolation design to protect from shock.  Check youtube vids.- Funky silicon bumpers to protect phone from drops.- Very durable design without much added bulk.There are some minuses however:- Case is difficult to remove.  This is a plus and a minus.- Buttons are non-tactile and a bit difficult to press.- Silicon bumpers pickup lint and dust.Overall, this is an excellent buy for $20.  I've owned many phone cases and this case is one of the best.Note:  I was able to make the buttons very tactile and easy to press by cutting small slits underneath the power and volume buttons.  The case should be made with these slits in place.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BWSYF3W" id="B00BWSYF3W-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-08:</strong> I had an otterbox but this was much cheaper and it protects my phone much better.

The profile of the case is slightly larger than my most favorite case yet the "Incipio SA-376 DualPro Case for Samsung Galaxy S4 - Pink/Charcoal Gray". However, I purchased this case because it is slim and bright yellow, and I wanted it to stand out. But, unless you lay it face down it will not stand out. Darn it!  The sides and front are almost all black. Lay it down face up and it's no longer easily visible. In fact this AM in the kitchen it kinda blended in on the granite countertop.  It's just too much black, I want something that will protect and slap me in the face with color.Well I guess I am still looking for a BRIGHT colored slim (but protective) case for the S-4 (otterbox and others too bulky to fit in my pocket).

While those have the benefit of small size and being fully self-contained, they totally take over the outlet! I can sort of live with that in the kitchen since the outlets are above the counter, but my office outlets are near the floor, making it a mess of cables and devices when using the charger.This design uses a cord to plug into the outlet so I can keep the charger on my desk and not have to deal with a mass of cords and devices on the floor. The case is nicely styled with rounded edges. I have the white version, and it looks nice on my desk - blends right in without shouting &#34;I'm a charger!&#34;.It measures about 4.25 inches wide at the widest point and is about 3.75 inches deep. The power cord plug into the back. The end that plugs into the outlet is just a regular plug without any type of wall wart. That's a huge plus for me since my power strips don't have room for another block-sized transformer.The 4 USB ports are on the front. Two are 2A; two are 1A. The port labels are easy to read (black on white).The build quality appears to be pretty good. The ports are well anchored and didn't move at all when I stressed the cords. There&#8217;s a light that indicates the charger has power.I used it to charge a variety of devices. Totally uneventful, which is what I look for in a charger.The only downside is that the charger is not as portable as those that plug right into the outlet since you need to carry the power cord along with the charger. But, the ability to keep it on my desk more than makes up for that. This will be my stay at home charger.Well worth considering if you&#8217;re looking for a multi-port charger that can sit on your desk and not have to deal with a wall wart.[Sample provided for review]</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GN6QZ0Y" id="B00GN6QZ0Y-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-16:</strong> The box is very lightweight, making it useful for travel; two of the ports deliver 2 A and two of them deliver 1 A, which is all I need for phone, tablet, an earpiece, and a guest phone.This might be obvious to many people, especially if you paid attention in grade 6 science class, but I had to figure it out with some research and reading: I had assumed that all USB power sources were the same. Not so. Until I bought this I had been charging my tablet with a power source that came bundled with a Bluetooth earpiece, and I couldn't figure out why it took 12 hours or more to charge the tablet. It turns out there are several different power capacity levels for USB chargers; the earpiece power source only provided 0.5 amps (0.5 A), but once I plugged my tablet into the 2 A port on this unit, it charges in a reasonable amount of time (a few hours). Unlike voltage, electric devices draw the amperage they need from the source, right, so it doesn't matter if you plug a tiny earpiece into a 2 A-rated socket, it'll just use as much as it needs. But if you plug in a device that could use more amps into a wimpy source, it can't get its maximum and will take longer to charge. Voltage through USB is not an issue because that, at least, seems to be standardized.The other thing I learned the hard way is that there are USB cables that are designed only to charge a device, and they cannot carry data. I would think these would be clearly marked as &#34;for charging only,&#34; but they're not. So the USB cable you use to connect to your computer can charge the device, but the USB cable sold with charging equipment might or might not allow you to connect the device to your computer.The only tiny complaint I have about this device is that the blue LED that indicates it is plugged in is very *bright*. I positioned it under the side of my bed, and with the lights out the blue glow makes my bed look like a customized low-rider. I fixed this small issue by dimming the light by placing a sticky note over it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GN6QZ0Y" id="B00GN6QZ0Y-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-26:</strong> While the 1st unit did not work on my Note 3 (full AMPS) which is why I order as I have the lower AMP ones.

The connection doesnt seem to be my problem I'm pretty sure its the actual charger, because it doesnt go back to charging when I wiggle it or jiggle it or twist it around or anything, just cuts in and out whenever it wants, and pretty much uses up more battery than it charges.Going in the garbage and buying a different brand.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GN6QZ0Y" id="B00GN6QZ0Y-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-26:</strong> I bought these on sale and it was a pretty good deal. However, the units are unusually large when compared to other options.

With this unit there are two dedicated tablet charger slots and two dedicated phone charger slots. The Anker version is also 40W whereas this one is only 30W.That being said, it does as it was advertised and charges my goodies.

Over hundreds of miles of monotony, two things were a necessity to keep me entertained, and us not on each others' nerves while my mom was driving: my iPad, and a good enough car charger to keep it functioning.The iPad drains fairly quickly while using it actively and the screen brightness is turned up reading, playing games etc. I have a number of old car chargers that I have tried, that show "not charging," or only have one port. With the multitudinous devices that are a part of modern life, two ports are a must. I don't like having to sacrifice my iPad if it needs charging, just because my or someone else's phone is running low on juice.This charger stands out amongst the many offerings on the market, as it provides 4.2A for the two ports (2.1A per port). Many dual port car chargers only provide 2.1A shared, which may be enough for one tablet, or one possibly two smartphones. Tablets such as the iPad 1, 2 and 3 use 2.1A by themselves. Smartphones vary, but use around 1A. Add those current demands together, and you have a total that the Mpow can handle but many car chargers can't. With an under-powered car charger, devices would charge, but slowly due to the lack of current. They may even discharge, hence the "not charging" message that Apple users will be so familiar with, which would mean that the devices are charging at a snail's pace.I had my iPad 4 plugged in to this Mpow car charger, as well as an iPhone 5, and both charged with no "not charging" messages. I also tried my mom's iPad 2, plugged in while my iPad 4 was plugged in. Both charged simultaneously. The newer iPads, the 4 and Air, use 2.4A optimally; the Apple AC wall adapter is 12W. Power is current x voltage, so the stock wall charger is 12W at 2.4A and 5V. Newer iPad hardware, thus, should charge faster theoretically with a current of 2.4A vs. the maximum 2.1A provided by each port of this Mpow car charger. However, keeping all variables constant, and comparing charge times from the 12W wall adapter to this car charger, I have so far found the charge rate difference to be minimal. Bottom line, the Mpow car charger can charge two iPads at once, and does so at a similar rate to your wall adapter.The Mpow charger has a blue light to show it is plugged in properly and providing current. It isn't obnoxiously bright. It's also quite slim, in spite of the power it cranks it.The head that the USBs plug into is not bulky, and it doesn't stick out of the 12V connection a lot. When I took it with me to put in another vehicle, it easily slipped into my bag. I MUCH prefer car chargers without the built-in cables, giving me the choice of what I plug in. They also take up less room when put away in the glove box or compartment, and not in use.My one annoyance is that this charger could have a tighter fit in the 12V. It does come out too easily, if your cords are too short and you tug a cord taut. A few times, I grabbed the iPhone with the short stock Lightning cable (3 feet), and the entire car charger popped out. I solved this by adding the USB extensions I had, lengthening the cables. If you DON'T like having long cables plugged into your car charger, you may have to put up with your short cables causing this charger to pop out a lot when you pick up your devices. When pulling a cable out of the car charger connection, you'll also have to put a little pressure on the Mpow so it wouldn't come loose, too. I've had other car chargers pop loose, but this Mpow one does seem to have it happen more easily than other models I have used.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GN6QZ0Y" id="B00GN6QZ0Y-review23" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-31:</strong> Excellent charger, provides the output that was promised.

I tested it with a Galaxy Note 3 in the 1 Amp port and a Tab 3 10.1 tablet in the 2.4 Amp port and both charged as fast as the high speed charger I normally use in my car.I also tried charging with the devices switched in the ports, with the tablet in the 1 Amp and the phone in the 2.4 Amp. They both Charged simultaneously. I should note that when I test my phone I do so with music streaming and GPS turned on. Some chargers actually cannot keep up with the discharge rate during that test. This one did.The reason why I awarded this five stars is the integrated protection that will s*** down charging if it detects voltage issues (high or low), and when your device is fully charged. More and more chargers are showing up with those features, but not as small as this or in this price range. That I know about, anyway.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GN6QZ0Y" id="B00GN6QZ0Y-review25" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-03:</strong> I'm using it for Galaxy S3 + Note 2 and it seems to charging pretty good simultaneously.Blue power indicator light is very dim and can't see it during the day.

Taking it out of the box revealed a very compact dual car charger, about 3.5&#34; in length and almost 1&#34; across usb port side. When I say compact, I mean it was a size of a regular single port charger, while they were actually able to squeeze two in there. Another good point about compact size is that it won't take too much room in cigarette outlet and won't interfere with anything next to it. Once plugged into the outlet, it has a nice soft blue light to indicate the power is on and also to guide the connection in the dark. I do have to note that usb connection itself is a bit on a tight side which is actually good to hold the cable without falling out. But at the same time pulling on the cable will actually remove the charger itself unless you hold it down with your hand.The most important test is if it can actually deliver 2 amps per port. A lot of the chargers claim they do, but it only works when one port is plugged in. In this case, I was able to confirm charging my Note 2 at max speed (the same reading I get from my original 2A Samsung wall charger), and I was able to do that while also charging Nexus 7 (HD, 2013 edition) which charges at 1.5A. Although I don't have two Note 2 to verify full 4.2A dual charging capacity, I have a feeling that won't be a problem.Overall, I found this dual usb car charger to have great performance, solid build, and delivering it's advertised charging capacity without a problem. Covered by 18-months warranty and currently on Amazon for $6.99 (down from original $9.99, need to use code MPOW01CA at checkout) - this is one fantastic value!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GN6QZ0Y" id="B00GN6QZ0Y-review32" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-05:</strong> Mpow: F-Amazon Support: A+Inserted into cig. lighter... 2 hours dirve later, battery depleted, no charging apparent...Root-cause: One of the silver prong fell into the casing !!!This product is a joke</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GN6QZ0Y" id="B00GN6QZ0Y-review33" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-03:</strong> Provides good flow for 2 phone charging in my car.

There is a built in plastic screen protector on the interior hard case, so there's no need to use a separate one to prevent scratches. All the buttons are well defined on the rubber outer case, so volume, power and the home buttons are all still easily pressed. The thick rubber outer case helps protect against bumps and falls, and makes holding the iPod easier by giving it some texture.

I protects it from the weather too.  The only thing that got through was my sons drool (don't let your kid suck on your phone for five minutes, and that solves the problem).  But this case fits the phone perfectly, and I love that it comes with a cover over the screen and the touch screen still works great.The only negative, and everyone says it, is the camera.  I always turn my flash off and the pictures look pretty good.  If I turn the flash on, it reflects off the cover and the picture is white and blurry.  Yes, you also need two hands to take pictures (you need the extra hand to hold the rubber cover back, it does NOT stay uncovered on its own).  Worst case scenario you rip the case off if you need to take a good picture with the flash, it's not too big a deal considering the protection you get with this case.By far more protective than any otter box, if you really care about your iphone and don't mind a bulky case, do it!

I used a razor blade and cut it right out & my front cam & prox sensor works perfectly now, however that does defeat the purpose of it being "rainproof". The camera flap is annoying to say the least. After only one day I cut it off and can't even tell there was one there, still looks just as good. The only big CON is the flash issue.... When using flash it makes photo whitish, distorted and blurry. I am thinking that maybe there is a fix, perhaps painting/coloring it to keep it from causing a glare? Either way, most of my cons were fixable... Then again I shouldn't have had to cut on my case to make it usable. So in a nutshell, I like the case but not as much as I thought I would. Oh, and I had the same problem with my otterbox and my proximity sensor so it is not a case defect, it's something to do with the WHITE iPhone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00540EZFC" id="B00540EZFC-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-20:</strong> Super protection!

I usually use OB defenders. I was browsing around on Amazon, and came across this "warehouse deal" for the Survivor for $17 plus $5 and change for shipping & in the comments it said that it is in original packaging marked as 'used-like new condition.' Still the same 30 day return policy applied, so i fig'd why not? I rec'd the item within 2 days, ordered it Sunday & had it by Tues afternoon. The item was in the original packaging sealed - it doesnt even look like anyone had this item previously & returned it. (btw if you purch this case at full price its anywhere from $40-$50.)Anyway, this is a very rugged case - it feels better than the defenders IMO. I think its about the same size, maybe a teeny bit bigger but not by much at all. ALL ports on this case have a little door flap to close them off, and in addition to that - the built-in screen protector also covers not just the screen, but the ear piece that you hear through as well. So far i've taken a couple of calls & it doesnt interfere with the sound or proximity sensor on the 4S. All ports are easily accessible - the only one that is kinda bugging me right now is the flap that covers the camera. I've heard of alot of people just cut that one off, but i dont think i'll do that myself. It protects the lens of the camera & i dont use my camera excessively. As for the belt clip that comes with it - i never use them so i can't comment on that. I can say just looking at it, that it seems kinda flimsy - in this aspect i'd say OB does their belt clip for the defender better.Overall, right now i feel this case is better protection than the OB defender is & i really like it - especially the pink/white!! I would definately recommend this case to someone looking for great protection.  Hopefully it holds up just as good as it looks :)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00540EZFC', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00540EZFC', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00ASUZILS</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00ASUZILS</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00ASUZILS" id="B00ASUZILS-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-09:</strong> Excellent for Nexus 7 tablet.

I took it apart and after looking at other available alternatives, I found that there is isn't a replacement that will fit inside the protective case front.  This is a real pity as I really liked the protection that the case offered.I bought another Supcase but without the built-in protective screen and was able to purchase a screen protector that is smudge proof and doesn't collect dust.

This is what makes Anker's efforts pretty amazing! For $40 they were able to make a case that is relatively slim, packed with a huge 2400mAh battery, and being MFI approved. With a fully charged case I can usually get about one and a half charges out of it, which has already came in handy a couple of times. The overall feel and build quality of the case is really impressive, and the installation and removal is simple and straight forward.There are a couple things that I think Anker could fix to make this the ultimate iPhone 5 battery case. First one being that the back of the case is just to slippery, I constantly have to worry about the phone slipping out of my hand when in use. The second problem I found was that the quality of stand was lacking, every time I would wrap my hand around the phone I could feel the stand shifting around, which took away from that overall quality feel that the case has. Other than those two things, this case has impressed me, and I have no hesitation recommending it to anyone looking for a good looking, great performing battery case at an amazing price.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FIIX394" id="B00FIIX394-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-25:</strong> I tested 5 cases side by side.I did not like the button controls, the lip by the screen was too low to have much protection, and the ring that snaps on around the phone doesn't feel like it will stay on for very long.

What I received did not match the product in the listing.2. It's almost impossible to use the speakerphone or play music while attached to the Anker.Let me make it absolutely clear : I love Anker products and I have purchased several of them from Amazon. That's the reason I ordered this over any other competing product in the marketplace. What I received will make me pause to think twice before I blindly order again in the future.I do not know if the fault lies at the feet of Amazon, or Anker. Truly, in all descriptions and even the video reviews there is a rudimentary stand on the back, but not so on the one I received. There is no stand at all. I don't know if Amazon lumped a bunch of old reviews in with a revised product, or if Anker revised the unit and just didn't think to update the page on Amazon. All I know is what I received DID NOT match what was represented. That, to me, is very close to bait 'n' switch.Even so, that did not stop the unit from doing what it purports to do - recharge the iPhone. In this one thing the Anker does exactly what it was purported to do. I do not think it made the iPhone too big, cumbersome or bulky. I am super impressed that you can sync AND charge with the included... what is this cable? USB mini? USB micro? Whatever they call it, my only beef with it is the fact it is way, way too short.Also, I found almost immediately that I missed my belt holster. That's a personal problem, but it would be nice if there were an option to buy a belt clip for the Anker. Just saying.The fatal flaw was the sound. I am sure the engineers and designers thought they had it nailed when they drilled holes in the case that appeared to line up with the holes in the iPhone. I am going to go out on a limb and say they didn't actually slap the final product on an actual iPhone and try to use it to play music, or make a speakerphone call. Nothing, but nothing I have run into will make your iPhone sound more cheap, crappy and tinny than attaching this Anker battery to it.Call it a hum, rattle, vibration... call it what you will, but the end result is it appears almost none of the sound energy is being directed out of the holes in the Anker case. Rather, it feels like the sound is trying to fire out of the bottom (power button side) of the Anker. You can even get the Anker to vibrate across your desk if you put the volume on high. The tinny, cheap sound was quite a shock. So if I am forced to choose between the natural sound of the iPhone, and the craptacular sound of an iPhone in an Anker... I end up wishing I had just purchased an external battery.So there is the let-down. Everything to this point I had purchased with the Anker name on it had oozed quality. Not so with the Anker battery case. Between the difference in product arriving at my door, and the really lousy sound, it forever shattered my expectations of Anker products. That's the bottom line.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FIIX394" id="B00FIIX394-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-05:</strong> Made my battery life so much better!

I have a few complaints, but nothing too significant that would warrant you to NOT buy the case.-----------CHARGING-----------Charges battery fast, gives roughly 50% more battery life. Great build quality and sleek looks match iPhone design. Very well made case overall. The first time I tested the Anker case, I was listening to music via the native Music App on the iPhone and my iPhone was at 60% charge. Roughly 20 minutes later, while still listening to music, it was at 84%. Roughly 45 minutes into my charging, while still listening to music, my iPhone 5 hit 100%. This was pretty impressive to me, especially since I always listen to music.The second time around, I was NOT listening to any music and I just let my phone charge. I started charging my iPhone 5 at 20%. 30 minutes into my charging, my iPhone was at 62%. 15 minutes later, at 88% charging, the Anker case needed to be re-charged. The results were actually very impressive to me as I did testing while listening to music and while not. I was pleased to say the least with the battery life, the amount of time it took to charge (especially while listening to music).----------FEATURES----------Case comes with 2 different colored bezels to secure the phone to the case, black and a transparent-ish/clear. Useful kickstand to keep the phone in landscape mode to watch movies, listen to music, etc. Included 3.5mm audio extension cable is a must if you use the case and want to listen to music, glad they included it.

The only wish I had was that the back wasn't perfectly smooth, it would be nice if there was some texture to it so it was easier to hold (especially when trekking through the woods geocaching), however, that's a minor issue compared to the massive benefits of this battery.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FIIX394" id="B00FIIX394-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-13:</strong> At this price point, you really can't beat this battery case. It's very efficient, works as advertised, and has a nice design. One of the coolest features is that it essentially converts your lightning port into micro-USB for charging; it is nice to not need to buy a bunch of $20 lightning cables and just get cheap micro-USB cables instead!I generally got about a charge and a half out of the battery before it needed recharging on my iPhone 5. Call quality was NOT impacted by the microphone being somewhat covered up, though audio was a little bit less clear, but it was somewhat louder as well due to it echoing somewhat in the case before being sent out the front.As other reviewers have said, the stand is flimsy, however mine never broke or came loose like others'. Just be gentle with it and it'll serve its purpose well.My only real complaint is the LEDs on the back - they are WAY too bright in my opinion. If I was charging it on my nightstand and the lights were not covered up, the whole room would be lit up, which was annoying. I have a small nightstand and having to make sure the lights were covered was a bit of a pain.But, again, at this price point, it's really an awesome case, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone in the market for this type of product.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FIIX394" id="B00FIIX394-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-09:</strong> I was supplied an Anker 2400mAh MFI Certified Extended Battery Case for iPhone 5s (Black) for test and evaluation, and I promise that my review is fair and honest.Let me say one thing that before even testing this Battery Case for Iphone 5s, I was sure to give 5 stars. It looked very promising and exceptional product like other Anker products.Lets start with packaging and all the positive points first.Battery Case came in nice and easy to open box. Along with battery case itself, there was micro usb cable for charging, 2 case frames, audio jack extender, and user manual.Once i took the battery case out of the box, it felt very solid build material. It feels little heavy but it is meant to be heavy as it is a battery case not a normal easy to bend plastic or rubber case.The back material and texture is very soft, rubber feel and non-slippery. It grips well in my hands so there is very small chance of dropping my phone.I felt it is very well designed overall. The Iphone 5s fits perfectly in their and once either of the case frames is placed, the phone does not move at all. So its a perfect fit and perfect cuttings for volume buttons, on/off button, and camera/flash.On the bottom there is a opening for your headphone jack. You can insert your iphone headphone directly in their, but I will recommend using audio jack extender. Mainly because it is hard to pull out iphone headphones if placed directly in and might even damage your headphones in that process. So audio jack extender is a really helpful tool.On right side of the case is a micro usb port for charging the case and phone itself. I think which is a plus point.On back side is a power on/off button with four LEDs. Holding on to power button for couple seconds turns on the battery case. The LEDs will tell you how much power does the battery case is currently holding.I tested this battery case with iphone 5s after battery case was completely charged (all 4 LEDs were on). At this point my iphone 5s battery was at 10%. Once I turned on the battery case, it immediately started to charge the phone. With only little use, the phone battery was charged 100% very quickly and one of the LEDs on battery case was still on. Then I charged my phone again at 70% and it charged my Iphone upto 91% before the battery case died. I was very impressed by its charging ability. You can say it charged my iphone 5s once completely with doubling its life.One thing I would really like to see this case in more colors with more color options for case frames. This will give more choices for other users.After testing I can say this is definitely a useful battery case. Especially for people who use their phone a lot and usually drain the battery very easily and want to extend the phone battery life by charging it without cables. This case definitely deserves 5 stars. Very Happy with the product as it is worth the cost.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FIIX394" id="B00FIIX394-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-20:</strong> I got this battery case because it was such a great price.It does the job of recharging your iPhone when needed like other battery cases.But there are few negatives about the case so I can't give a 4 or 5 stars.The back of this product is very slippery! I dropped it few times just taking it out of my pocket.Speaking of drops, Once I dropped it in the parking lot and this thing just fell apart all over the parking lot.The ring is a separate piece (dark gray) from the back and it's very flimsy and cheap. That ring that surround the outside was easily broken after the first drop. Luckily, it came with another one (clear) which I am using now.My iPhone came out after the drop and suffered few scratches. :(The little kickstand is really cheap and flimsy as well. the color sticker on the kickstand already came off. I had to stick it back on.But I don't even use that kick stand.The positive is that it does a good job of recharging. I get about 95% to 100% recharge with my iPhone 5s easily within an hour.Another positive is the price. Very low usually!Overall its not very attractive, too slippery and flimsy to be my everyday case.I only use it on trips and as an emergency backup.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FIIX394" id="B00FIIX394-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-11:</strong> The Anker 2400mAh MFI Certified Extended Battery Case for the iPhone 5/5s is what I was expecting when I received it in the mail several days ago. Slim, sleek, attractive and easy to use. With this being said allow me to dive into this review.The Anker 2400mAh MFI Certified Extended Battery Case for the iPhone 5/5s dimensions are tailored to fit perfectly to your iPhone 5 and 5s, while the weight of the battery case is comparable to others on the market I think it may actually be a bit lighter than many of their competitors' offerings.The 2400mAh (Milliamp hour is a measurement of a battery's performance capabilities) rating is more than enough to give your device a full charge from a completely drained battery on your iPhone. In testing this battery I let my phone's battery dwindle to a 10% charge before turning on the Anker 2400mAh MFI Certified Extended Battery Case for the iPhone 5/5s. It took about 1 hour 40 minutes to give my iPhone 5 a full charge. For a completely drained iPhone battery I would suspect it will take about 2 - 2.5 hours to reach a full charge. (I want to note that during the charge cycle of my iPhone 5 from the Anker battery case I had Bluetooth turned on and in use, as well as WiFi. Charging times will vary significantly based on your usage and which background services you have running on your phone at the time of charging.)The Anker 2400mAh battery case itself is recharged via micro USB (cable is provided) and took approximately 2 hours to reach a near-full charge when charging from a 5v (1500 mA) rated wall outlet. However being this is still relatively new I am aware that it will take a few charging and discharging cycles to fully utilize the battery's maximum potential. So if your battery doesn't charge fully on the first few charging cycles, it's not unusual or broken, it just means your Anker Battery Case is completely normal. The LED indicator lights on the back of the battery case always let you know just how much juice you have left in your Anker Battery so you're never guessing.Using the Anker 2400mAh battery case isn't as intuitive as I had hoped for, however this isn't a problem it just means that I had to review the ever-competent instructions which Anker provides with all of their various products requiring them. Installation of your iPhone 5/5s into the Anker external battery case after reviewing the instructions is a simple process after that. One benefit to this case is that Anker provides you with both a clear shell and a smoke grey shell to wrap around your phone after you slide it into the battery case. Choices are great, nice added bonus, thanks Anker.There are drawbacks to the Anker 2400mAh MFI Certified Extended Battery Case for the iPhone 5, 5s, but these are not fatal flaws! One is the charging port, it's nice that Anker provide a micro USB cable to charge the battery case, but having another cable is like...well, having another cable. Two: The headphone port is REALLY buried up in the new case, but Anker have provided an extension cable (the proper one!) that you can plug your headphones into and use as you normally would, the cable even has 3 separate poles (left channel, right channel, microphone) so you're able to use the Apple earbuds that came with your iPhone for music and communicating. Three: The lock button on top of the iPhone is difficult to access (if your hands are big) due to being recessed in this new battery case. The lock button access is the biggest issue I encountered with this phone case, it's not a deal breaker, but it would be nice if Anker could address this in their next generation model of battery cases for the iPhone and add a rubber bumper or something to make using the lock button a little easier.Ideally the Anker 2400mAh MFI Certified Extended Battery Case for the iPhone 5/5s is for anyone who has an iPhone 5/5s and is looking for an alternative to portable batteries with their charging cables hanging off the phone, or carrying around a wall adapter charger and cable with you which leaves you always searching for the nearest outlet to plug into. The Anker 2400mAh MFI Certified Extended Battery Case for the iPhone 5/5s takes away these annoyances and is a self-contained charging unit that fits on the phone and is ready at a moment's notice. It's incredibly useful and I'm certain I will utilize it for quite some time to come. I forgot to mention that the battery case has a kickstand on the back so you can watch videos, or use Facetime handsfree! Very cool feature!Overall my impression of the Anker 2400mAh MFI Certified Extended Battery Case for the iPhone 5/5s is very favorable. I would recommend it to my friends, colleagues or anyone looking for a battery case for the iPhone 5/5s. You can't go wrong with this device and it may be the difference between getting that last text message of the night, or not. With this battery case you'll get that last text and phone call, and hours of surfing the Internet that you normally wouldn't without it. That is unless you camp out near the power outlets while you're out on the town. ;-)Overall Score 4 out of 5 stars:1. Function: 5 stars2. Design: 4 stars (Buttons are hard to access with fat fingers)3. Ease of Use/Installation: 4 stars4. Durability: 5 stars5. Price: 5 stars*I was provided a free sample from the good folks at Anker for a fair, unbiased and honest review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FIIX394" id="B00FIIX394-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-28:</strong> i love it so muchh!!!! totally worth the money.This provides a full charge and a half for my iPhone 5.

The new 2400mAh extended Battery case for the iPhone 5/5s certainly added to my loyalty to Anker. Anker has been able to manafacture a case that not only looks great from the outside but is also useful for any power user. I know, atleast for me, that I am always on the go and rarely have an outlet available - this makes having an extended battery life crucial for daily operation. With the new case, I am guaranteed that last phone call or that urgent text message to my boss. The new case really captures the essence of why Anker excels in the mobile market.I'd like to talk about the downfalls, but I will first recognize everything that has been done well.---First, the material that has been used on the outside is very smooth, It allows one to grasp his/her phone firmly while being nice to the touch. The smoothness compliments the iPhone's simple and elegant look.---The 4 lights and button on the back are clear indications of how much battery remains in the case. With the ease of simply pressing the power button, one gets a snapshot of the increment (25-100%) remaining. Quick and easy.---The addition of being MFI certified really comes in handy. The case simplifies the need for carrying multiple cables into only one. Having the ability to have a generic USB cable makes life much easier rather than always having to remember to have the lightning one available.---Last, the case comes with 2 outer edges (black and clear). Although I have a gold iPhone 5s, I found that the black  outer edge suits the case better with a a more uniform look. Personally, I feel that the white contrasts too much with the already dark black case.Like anything, there are certainly areas where Anker could improve this product. A couple are listed below:---Probably the biggest problem for me is reaching over to the standby button on the device itself. With the attachment of this case, the button on the 5s is not as flush as it should be. Clearly, this can be inconvenient when you are in a rush to lock the device but is not a major fallback.---The case only comes in one color (black) currently making it mandatory for silver/gold owners to adapt to a dual-tone design rather than a sleek unified look which Apple aims for.---Lastly, the kickstand on the back is not very durable. It is glued on the back and easily prone to coming off. When it does come off, the case loses its look and one of the functions that is built in.Overall, the benefits and advantages outweigh the minor drawbacks that one experiences while using the new Anker MFI certified rechargeable case. It is evident that Anker has worked very hard in designing this case to perfection. There certainly areas in which Anker can focus its attention when releasing the next generation model. For now, this is my daily companion.UPDATE (4/9/2014):Anker recently sent me their "updated" version of this case for evaluation, and man am I blown away. Compared to the original iPhone charging case which was a killer piece of equipment, this new and improved Anker MFI Apple Battery Case is simply amazing. The case has a brand new finish on the back that is smooth on the touch and makes the iPhone much easier to hold. Anker got rid of the kickstand on the case which I do not mind at all since I barely had any of use of that to begin with. Lastly, the case has instilled buttons for standby and volume making it more comfortable to press and operate.Overall, great new revision to the product. If you haven't already bought the case, I'd certainly recommend it over other brands!Disclaimer: Anker provided me with a free test sample of this product for my honest feedback and evaluation.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00FIIX394', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00FIIX394', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00FG2QY5W</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00FG2QY5W</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FG2QY5W" id="B00FG2QY5W-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-13:</strong> on the side of the case its messed up and damaged can you send menanother one please i sent a message about this before but there was no response</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FG2QY5W" id="B00FG2QY5W-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-10:</strong> had my doubts because of the low price but this is fantastic.

Almost everything is great. The black bumper looks great and does not feel cheap. It has a grip on the side, so the phone will not slide out of your hands. IT has a nice lip to cover the phone and protect the sides. The back piece is a frosted clear. It allows me to show off the white color of the phone WITHOUT creating those bubbles you will get on other cases. It took me a long time to find a case that didn't do that, and I am happy with this case. The only reason why this gets a 95 out of a 100 is because the buttons are a little harder to press. It does not make it too difficult, just have to get used to pressing the buttons on this case.

It takes a bit of effort to get all of the parts on, but they fit well. I also love the detachable clip, since I often wear clothing without pockets and don't like to carry a purse just for my phone.

The case is very durable and easily withstands everyday (and not so everyday) drops and bumps.  The touch screen is very responsive and is an improvement over the iPhone 4 case. It attaches to the outside of the silicone cover. This makes it easy to remove and clean.  The removable clip is more durable and has a better over all design then the previous model.  On the downside, the case does make it hard to hear the speaker.  The silicone cover does a nice job of absorbing shock, but it also tends to stick to your pants pocket when removing it.  Also, aftermarket headphone plugs may not fit into the narrow access port designed in the plastic case.I use my iPhone 5 frequently in rugged situations in the wilderness.  Despite a few shortcomings, this case more than meets my needs.Pros:1. touch screen is very responsive and easy to remove and clean2. case can take a beating3. case is relatively water resistant and keeps out most dirt and dustCons:1. case make the speaker a bit hard to hear2. silicone cover makes it hard to pull out of your pants pocket3. headphone jack requires a narrow shaft on the plug</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0099VXLCU" id="B0099VXLCU-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-16:</strong> this product was junk packaging was old , arrives with tears in it was horrible I would stay away from griffin in the future</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0099VXLCU" id="B0099VXLCU-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-25:</strong> i thought it was a good idea, except a few flaws made me return it. the seals on teh ports make it somewhat water resistant, except the big gaping holes on the screen, which let water get in, mess up the touch ability, which made me need to open it up and clean it. other than that its a typical manly bulky protective case. also good seller cuz it arrived quickly</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0099VXLCU" id="B0099VXLCU-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-18:</strong> I guess by now I phone 5 users are surprised at how fragile the i phone 5 is.

I could not pass it up as I got a super deal here on Amazon.Have not used it because I have one of those LIFEPROOF $100 cases I am using now, that's 100% waterproof. But I did try the Griffin case out and for the average Joe who likes a BELT CLIP case that's rugged it's YOUR case.I'm on a boat all the time, it rains, splashes, etc. So I'll keep using the Lifeproof (way too expensive case) because I have too. But for the average person. The Griffin Survivor is fantastic!MEN, don't do phones in their pockets. WE use belt clips. Especially MEN doing stuff, rather than sitting behind a desk.And it's hard to find cases with this kind of protection with BELT CLIPS.

Although I did not drop test my phone or dunk it in water, examination of the case convinces me it will be good protection.  There were mixed reviews about sound quality -- I can report that sound is fine -  mic, earphone, and speaker phone.  No problem, sounds like without the case. I had no problem using the touchscreen through the case window.  The case is also more comfortable to hold than the bare phone. I like it a lot. This case is, however, a bit bulky: 3/4in thick, 2 7/8 in wide, 5 7/16 in long.  Not huge, but a bit big for me to carry in my pocket or on my belt at work. The belt clip provided is secure, but not easy to use. I bought an incipio case for weekday use, and will use the Griffin on the weekends.

A thick rubber cover that locks over the plastic shell and provides tight fitting covers for all ports, camera, etc. This covers the bottom, sides, and provides a raised ridge of rubber above the screen.3. A plasic screen cover that locks securely onto the rubber shell. This does include a screen protector.4. A clip on rotating belt clip. The clip pops open and locks in a position to provide a stable "landscape" stand to watch videos, etc. The belt clip also locks in the closed position if you wish to keep the jaws from opening and getting caught on your pocket when sliding it in, should you not want to clip it.This case is very substantial, once on the phone you cannot see the clean lines of your iPhone 5 any longer, but you know that the $800+ investment is quite protected from damage and the elements. I wouldn't call it water-proof, but I would say that it protects against small amounts of spillage and major dust.The only con I have found is the plastic screen protector is raised above the screen and it takes a bit to get used to what is needed for touch controls with it on, especially if you are used to using the phone without a cover or a screen protector. But once I got used to it, it hasn't been a problem.So far, no one has complained they can't hear me with this on, and I have had no problems hearing callers when using the phone in regular mode and with the speakerphone.I highly recommend this case to protect the investment in the iPhone 5.  They don't call it the survivor for nothing!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0099VXLCU" id="B0099VXLCU-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-09:</strong> The screen corners weren't able to touch like full use of your iphone =hard to play games and the such, and back cover camera piece broke off the 2nd day.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0099VXLCU" id="B0099VXLCU-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-19:</strong> Five star quality case.Great cost.Huge!Buttons don't always line up. You need to push on the case a little to have them line up. The clip covers the charging hole, so you can't use the clip stand while charging the phone. This case is a lot bigger than my wife's cell phone case! Still have not decided if I like the clip on belt.Easy to take the font face off for cleaning. Unlike same iPad case that we own, the back camera flap swivels down. The iPad case folds and will not hold in place. This is a big positive! Clip allows phone to face in our out on your belt.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0099VXLCU" id="B0099VXLCU-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-08:</strong> The first thing youll notice about this case is its a big one! huge! definitely provides the drop protection.Well thought design but seriously flawed.The black tape that covers the ear piece, speaker, and mic ports make the phone pretty much useless.The camera cover on the back covers up the noise cancelling mic and every now and then when covered you will hear a static on your phone. That basically the mic not knowing what to do in louder situations.So, remove the tape, open the camera cover when talking, and you have a perfect case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B0099VXLCU', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B0099VXLCU', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B009PLBLQC</h2>    <p class="price"> $B009PLBLQC</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009PLBLQC" id="B009PLBLQC-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-15:</strong> The phone works pretty good but the advertisement wasn't quite right. Supposed to be 8G for space and if you go into the settings it says total space is 4.52G which is way off from 8G. I filled it up pretty quick. It doesn't have SBeam as well which was something I wanted or that is what sold me. I wanted the smaller phone (mini) so this one is a little bigger than the samsung admire but functions better than the admire. I already have the phone almost filled up and have the apps I was interested in but not too much more for other apps. Also if you never had one of these android phones, the programs are like commercials. Many of the free one's have permissions you have to agree to when you install it.Also you should buy a screen protector. Scratched glass slightly first month of use. Now you see some shine of color in a white background.Battery life doesn't last too long as well. You can kill a battery in 5 hours of use. (1500mAh)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009PLBLQC" id="B009PLBLQC-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-09:</strong> Great smart phone. I Love its size. I highly recommend it for all. Screen size is amazing, super clear, super clear camera, light weight, easy to use and figure out, tons of applications out there, and super value for money.The only downside of this phone is battery life time. You definitely need couple of chargers around you if you are a frequent user and on the go. I recommend buying a car charger along with this phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009PLBLQC" id="B009PLBLQC-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-23:</strong> My wife's phone (an EVO) keep dropping service and would not accept rings, rather rolling over to voice mail immediately. At first we thought there was a problem with the service provider. We were given a second phone however it preformed the same as the first phone. We then received this Samsung Galaxy S 111 phone and it has been great. No more failure to ring and no dropped calls. We are convinced the issues were phone related and not service related. This is a true smart phone in all aspects. I use an iPhone and the first thing we tried was to locate an establishment. We both have 4g service. The Samsung outperforms the iPhone by a great margin. The screen is slightly larger and much more brighter. There are great apps, in fact more than you will ever need or use so don't let a competitor's brag about having lots of apps turn you off.The apps are easy to download and install. Everything that was on the EVO was easily transferred to the Galaxy. There are a limited number of incoming phone ring tones however you can download additional rings if there are none that suit you. We did find that with the sue of hearing aids the ring tones installed as somewhat weak and only a few can be turned up really loud.My wife uses the phone a  greta dal for texting and the larger key board makes that much easier on this phone. Providers may try to sell, you insurance on the phone which we found to be extremely high thus we did not purchase and with the amazing record we have with this phone so far that too was a very good decision.The cell phone is thin and slick thus I would highly recommend a plastic case cove for the phone to help with your grip.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009PLBLQC" id="B009PLBLQC-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-19:</strong> buy this phone because of its versatility.

In the past, I owned BIG SCREEN PHONES as Galaxy Note (with 5.3" screen, too heavy and too big) and wanted something smaller that I could hold in one hand comfortably. Since I am a true techie, I researched this phone for all specs as soon as it was released on several websites. Since this phone has EXCEEDED all of my expectations, here is my very detailed review of this very special and fun to use Mini S3 phone. My goal in this review is to help in your buying decision one way or the other regarding this phone.Update 8/24/13 - Just received today, the newest firmware/OS for the 4.1.2 OTA (on my phone directly) as it was updated from Samsung and this is very new at this date of Monday, August 5, 2013 and arrived in my phone's Notification area today. After the upgrade completed, I noticed at once that this phone is lightning fast and the touchscreen is very, very fast and responsive! This is the THIRD update that I received since I purchased this phone in April 2013. Each update is not that large, however, it enhances the performance of this phone. Very encouraged as if the updates keep coming regularly, perhaps4.2.2 will be coming to the S3 Mini. And from my research, it is possible that the S3 Mini may receive the 4.2 OS but it will be a while longer...Till then, I shall keep on trying to update and keep you informed...PROS:- SIZE AND WEIGHT: Perfect size for me as it fits easily into my jeans pocket or smallest purse. And I purchased a leather vertical case that clips to my waistband so I take it with me to the gym to listen to my music or radio when I work out.- STANDARD SIZED SIM CARD: The S3 Mini has a standard Sim card slot (unlike the full sized S3 that has a micro Sim slot). Good to know as I did not have to cut my Sim card, I just placed it into the S3 Mini and I was good to go, and I did not have to set up the APN settings for Internet and MMS as the setup did this for me automatically). This is good to know if you want to use your regular Sim card and not have to deal with settings yourself. What a great feature.- Phone call clarity etc. - No matter what my location using this phone for phone calls the clarity of calls is loud and clear whether on the phone's speaker, headset etc. I even had to turn down the volume quite a lot as the calls come in so well.- WiFi/3G (Internet): Connects to any WiFi I have tried very quickly and easily and the signal strength is excellent even when I am far from my router. And when not near a WiFi hotspot, I use AT&T; for data and easily get 3G and found the data to be very fast, almost as fast as my home WiFi is. (For browser, I installed Opera Mini free from Playstore and found it to be a very easy to use and fast browser).- Overall speed, performance, smoothness, picture quality of the screen--very fast and peppy. And I found a way to SAVE on both memory and on battery.  What I did was to go into Apps/ Manage Apps and DISABLED the apps I don't use. Without rooting the phone, you cannot uninstall pre-installed factory apps, but you can disable them. Disabling the ones you don't use makes the phone run faster and frees more memory! Since I am a techie, I know which ones to disable and which ones not to disable, so if in doubt, please ask me in the comments and I will be glad to assist you in this.- BATTERY LIFE: This phone has given me the BEST battery life of ANY smartphone or that I ever owned. And I use 100% brightness. For me, even at 100 brightness, if I use WiFi or Data just when I need it and then turn it off, I get all day into the night on one single charge! (I charge nightly and the phone is at 100% ready to go the next morning).- EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD - This helped to sell me on this phone as I can add my personal music, photos, videos and more to this phone!And I placed a 32g in mine for music, files etc. *Keep in mind where External SD cards are concerned: They are JUST for your personal files: music, videos, photos, and other files. When you install apps from Playstore or other sources, they store either in INTERNAL Memory Card or sometimes in the phone area (most store in the INTERNAL SD AREA). This is the law of the land where Android is concerned and ALL newer Android devices (including Samsung) work this way when storing your downloaded apps are concerned.- INTERNAL STORAGE SPACE:This phone is advertised at 8GB of Internal space. The 8GB is the space BEFORE the drive was formatted, OS installed and then factory apps installed. So what I had on the phone BEFORE I installed any apps it had 4.75GB left. This is how it is on any flash drive, SD card, Hard Drive as formatting alone takes up space.Also, since 3.0 Android and above, you cannot save any apps to your personal SD card. Instead the apps are installed one way or the other to the INTERNAL SPACE. However, the good thing is that your personal files as photos, music, videos, and more can be installed to your EXTERNAL SD Card so you do have that space for yourself.**I have a few apps I downloaded from the Playstore, but no games so I still have about 4.08 GB left on my phone for more apps later should I wish to install them.- Reading/Creating/Editing Word, Excel, Text Files and much more on this tablet: I downloaded a FREE APP called Kingsoft Office which I use for Office files (it reads, edits and creates Office files). And it also reads PDF eBooks so there is no need to download a separate PDF Reader app. *This is a MUST have if you have to read PDF or Word Docs etc, my docs are crisp and clear using this app.- CAMERA - The 5MP camera concerned me that is UNTIL I took both indoor and outdoor pictures and even video. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. When I printed out some close up and other shots, I was really happy with the detailing in the pictures. And it compared to the picture quality I had with my Samsung Galaxy Note with 8MP camera, so what a happy surprise! Turns out to be a pretty good camera.- Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth paired quickly with several devices and copied files at a great rate of speed.CONS:- Adobe Flash is not supported in this phone or ANY ANDROID DEVICE after 4.0 OS. The only way to get flash is to get a archived flash and use a high end browser such as Puffin or Maxthon Browser. So downloading the older archived flash gives the ability to view SOME internet videos, but this is better than no flash at all. Keep in mind this is a problem with ALL brands of Android devices with 4.0 OS and higher it is just after 4.0 Android came out, the NEW and best flash is NOT supported for Android devices. It is what it is...- Very small instruction "manual" provided with the tablet, however, I went to the Samsung site and downloaded the full manual and saved it in PDF on my laptop for reading anytime I need it. If you want the link for the manual, let you know in the comments and I will give it to you.- This phone will NOT accept an OTG (On the go) USB plug for flash drives, mice, etc. This was not a problem for me, I just plug in the USB Cable to copy files to the phone. So no big deal.-- International Phone so NO US WARRANTY. Not a problem for me because I have learned over time that if a device is going to fail, it usually does it within the first 30 days. This phone has been great--no problems at all!-- No NFC except on the model with the N on the model number. I do not use NFC so I have no problem with that.Bottom line: Would I buy this phone all over again? Yes I certainly would. Will this phone be the best for you? Yes, if you do not expect every bell and whistle feature from the BIG S3, want just the most important features, want a smaller and more lightweight phone that will do all the basic things of a Smartphone, then I totally recommend this phone!Hope this review has assisted you and thank you for reading it. Please feel free to ask me any questions in the comment area and I will answer all questions in a very timely manner.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009PLBLQC" id="B009PLBLQC-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-09:</strong> Purchased this product as a gift.

Well it is but there are steps to take if you use Straight Talk otherwise you can't access mobile data.Straight Talk use AT&T; and T-Mobile carriers and you get to pick which when you buy get your sim card. If you travel I strongly suggest you get an AT&T; sim for your phone as T-Mobile is more often found in large metros such as SF, NY, etc..To change your VPN settings for Straight Talk visit http://smartphonematters.com/help/help-setting-up-straight-talk-data-and-mms-on-the-blu-tank-4-5-running-android-4-1/ to create a Straight Talk mobile network and set the values.It's a great little phone (at least from my experience since it arrived a few days ago) and for the price who could complain given the OS, apps and HUGE internal memory. The latter is a big problem with other phones as the internal memory is where most apps reside and that memory fills rapidly.Buy one. I don't regret it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009PLBLQC" id="B009PLBLQC-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-16:</strong> I was about to purchase the mini until I read the part about no warranty.

I was looking for a simple (unlocked) phone with no contract. There were so many to choose from. I have heard that the Galaxy S4 is really good with so many features; however it is bigger and requires a contract. Being pragmatic as I am with a budget in mind for a phone, I came across this phone while searching at Amazon. I'm a Prime member and thus, am qualified for a 6 month 0 interest financing. The pebble blue SIII mini is really good and still has many features as a phone. I bought this phone from Worldwide Distributors (very good) and the phone (Android 4.1.2) arrived earlier than the target delivery date. The phone has a French language manual (European model). Being familiar with Android phones and tablets, it was easier for me to browse through the settings and change the language setting in English (US). I have disabled the apps that I don't use and battery life is very satisfactory. I like the 4 inch screen and it's perfect for my hand. I bought the CIMO black case cover and the color blended perfectly with the pebble blue. The CIMO cover really surprised me and it fits perfectly on the phone.I would highly recommend this Samsung Galaxy SIII mini to those people who will use it primarily as a phone. Of course, there are so many features and apps that goes with it if you want to connect to the internet or use it with a plan. In my case, I use the tablet/s for my internet browsing or other tasks related to it.

The phone arrived without a seal on the box, battery was not in a sealed wrapper and took too long to charge and discharged early. You could see that the phone had been previously handled, with fingerprints all over the back and front cover.  Thank goodness for amazon, as their staff were very helpful in getting a full refund.  I recommend avoiding The seller and choosing one whose products are &#34;fulfilled by amazon&#34;.  I did wind up reordering the same phone from Top10cell, fulfilled by amazon and the phone arrived within 3 business days.  The phone arrived with 2 seals on the box, which clearly states to not accept if broken or missing.  Inside, the blacking and contents were as they should be, battery in its sealed case and NO fingerprints all over the phone!  The phone itself is very nice, this far it has been working quite well and seems to have a boatload of features for the price.  I will leave the technical review for the techies...and there is a great one by a &#34;daisy s.&#34;  I recommend getting a micro sad card to increase storage space...I got a 32 gb card.  So, in summary, thumbs up for the phone, an excellent buy, thumbs way up for seller Top10cell and amazon...thumbs way down for Pacific Cellular distributor, out of Idaho.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009PLBLQC" id="B009PLBLQC-review27" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-22:</strong> We are changing from Blackberry and now we are buying a new S3 mini, just to try with Android, Its look nice and works perfect</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009PLBLQC" id="B009PLBLQC-review28" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-28:</strong> I am using this when in Europe and Asia with various SIM cards.

The phone functions very well. I have no issues with any of the functions. Except for one function,my MMS is not functioning right. But that is not the sellers fault. It is Straight Talks fault. I am very happy how the seller is handling everything. I have called and talked to the seller and they were very, very helpful and so determined to go beyond the call of duty, in trying to help me to get it fixed.They called me out of the blue to help me resolve the issue. They even told me I could return the phone if I wanted to.So I am satisfied the way they handle everything.I will do business with them again.

I used for sometime and I could not find anything wrong. Obviously if you play racing car games or Temple Run Brave, one can notice a little slowness, it is absolutely great for normal uses of navigation, running, as a music player, as a twitter client etc.The S3 Mini comes with a 4-inch Super AMOLED WVGA resolution display (800x480 pixels). It is called mini, but few years ago this probably is a mega. While less pixel factors than the 4.8-inch Galaxy S3, the Mini has 233  ppi where S3 has 305.96 ppi, the Mini's screen resolution is still well within range for a 4-inch screen. Memory can be increased easily and in a very cheap way with a microSD card. Card slot microSD, up to 32 GB.Highly recommend.

So the adapter they sent was for the phone charger since european outlet is different from us.Very disappointed, I returned both phonesBe careful when you buy a unlocked phone and check the sellerI don't know why Amazon don't allow to rate the seller (at least I couldn't in most of Amazon prime purchase), but at least I can post the name of the seller I have in my order: BLUETEKUSA (isn't interesting, the name is bluetekusa but the phone is european)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009PLBLQC" id="B009PLBLQC-review34" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-27:</strong> I've had this phone in hand for more than a week, with T-Mobile service for about a day now. It's fine so far.The phone is a lovely, sleek thing. I've handled its bigger brother, the Galaxy SIII, but that phone is just too big for me. I like the form and size of this one much better. I've been using an HTC Evo 4G phone for more than two years; this Galaxy S3 Mini is about the same size.This is a good phone with plenty of computing horsepower for me. The screen is beautiful and very responsive. In side-by-side comparison to my trusty old HTC Evo phone, this one blows the other one away. And the Galaxy S3 Mini has a slightly smaller screen! I'd wondered if I'd regret it for that reason but I absolutely do not. I don't even realize that the screen is smaller than my old phone, when I'm using this phone.One downside: I don't like the camera. It's laggy.By the way, my phone arrived with packaging in French, and set up with the French language on the phone. The seller included a plug adapter so the Euro style plug on the charger can be used here in the USA. It took a few seconds to get into the phone settings and choose US English as the phone language.PLEASE, people, don't complain if you get a "foreign" phone when you buy this phone unlocked. Because Samsung doesn't package this phone for sale for the US market. (Search for an article on Cnet called "Apple drops patent claim against Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini" from December 2012 for the background.) I found a user manual in English by going to Samsung's UK website (it won't be on Samsung's US website because Samsung doesn't sell or support this phone in the US). If you must have an unlocked phone tailored for US users right out of the box? Try buying an unlocked iPhone direct from Apple, or a Nexus 4 phone from Google (if the Nexus 4 is back in stock).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009PLBLQC" id="B009PLBLQC-review35" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-11:</strong> Samsung Galaxy S III Mini I8190 8GB Unlocked GSM Phone with Android 4.1 OS, is a good option if you like Samsung cellphones and you dont have enough money to buy the latest one, for sure is a great purchased i made here.

Case was in perfect condition and came in bubble wrap for protection!!! Case is super pretty and I tried it on my phone and it snapped on nice and tight- fit perfect on my Iphone 4, and I have a white iphone and it looked great with it!! Im uploadng a few pics of the case. The only thing I can say so far is the clear rhinestones give the phone a slightly grey appearance but otherwise it's perfect!!! I'll update after i've used it a while but for now, atleast, i'm giving it 5 stars. For durability it seems like every other bling case i've gotten, it'll be good for a month or two of everyday constant use and i'm pretty hard on my phone and case, and then the rhinestones will start to fall off primarily around the spots where you hold your phone to make a call. I usually buy 2 or even 3 at a time of my favorite bling cases so they last a while and atleast one non-bling case that will last for a while.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003V17N7I" id="B003V17N7I-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-09:</strong> YOU WILL PAY SO MUCH FOR YOUR IPHONE AND WHEN YOU PUT THIS CASE ON IT WILL MAKE IT LOOK CHEAP AS HELL, AND IF YOU DROP YOUR PHONE IT WILL NOT PROTECTE IT</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003V17N7I" id="B003V17N7I-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-08-11:</strong> I LOVE zebra print, and i LOVE bling.

Its only use is to allow you to play an iPod through the AVIC head unit.

You might even accept this deliberate limitation if this cord was $10, but for close to $50, you feel like a chump buying it.This works very well, so I'm giving it 4 stars, taking one off for the unconscionable price.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B004HW6F74', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B004HW6F74', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00A7O4TN8</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00A7O4TN8</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A7O4TN8" id="B00A7O4TN8-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-13:</strong> I like to play games on my phone while at home and don't like to hold the phone.

I have a 7&#34; Garmin hanging off of it, and bumps, etc. do not affect it, but you need to be mindful when tapping the Garmin.  I suggest checking the fit before you drive off each morning to be sure it's not slipping out. Over tightening on my Mini results in the device popping out.This would be PERFECT if the company added an additional segment to allow more placement movement, but that may drive the cost up substantially..  As it is, it blocks the A/C controls on my Mini Countryman.  I can access them being careful, but have to move the controls by memory, not by visual cues.  Since I tend to only use three setting on the A/C mode, and can access the temp and fan speed with no problems, this is not an issue.I really like the placement of the 7&#34; Garmin in the center console.  This gets the device out of the windshield, which I never really liked, but leaves it in a place that is not too far from your vision while driving.

It's incredibly easy to tighten it into my car's CD slot and it never seems to interfere with the CDs themselves. I use rental cars all the time and have yet to find a car in which this mount didn't work. The only thing I wish they would do is create some way to stabilize it. On roads that aren't particularly smooth this unit can bounce and shake pretty violently.

I am completely satisfied with the product and its delivery. New buyers just have to note that it takes a good amoune of care (and patience) to install this screen cover. If you hurry or bypass any of the steps mentioned in the instruction manual (that comes with the product case), then you are not gonna like what you get.So, take care, be patient and do exactly as mentioned in the instruction manual. If you want, you can also refer to the videos in Youtube that show you how to do the installation (I did the same). I was fortunate it came out without a single trapped dirt or bubble. Thats the beauty of a wet installation.One extra care may help (from my experience): Try installing in natural sunlight that diffuses through your windows (as against under a lamp). This way, you can catch and remove 99% of all dirt/lint from the phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0044IK8VU" id="B0044IK8VU-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-11:</strong> I did not get a chance to use this product and have sold it already to someone else.

It adheres to the screen nicely and causes no interference with the touch screen. The downside of being soft is that it absorbs scratches easily and they remain on the screen. Any scratches or nail marks that you can see on the protector are usually only visible at certain angles and are not really noticeable when you're using the phone in a normal fashion.The installation process is not difficult, you just have to make sure you read the directions a few times and follow them exactly. Also, when installing it is very nice that it does not stick to the screen right away; this allows the user to make sure it is on straight and can be corrected if not. Overall I'm happy that I have this screen protector considering Best Buy and AT&T;'s screen protectors are $15-$22. It does its job at protecting my screen, but it's not invisible which is why I gave it 4 stars.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0044IK8VU" id="B0044IK8VU-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-05-25:</strong> I have owned this screen protector for about 3 weeks now and overall im not impressed at all, there are several fingernail marks left on the screen and they don't go away.

So i stuck it out and put it on. 24 hours after, i still had issues. After reviewing the item on Amazon, i received an email with the offer to replace for free. (It was nicely suggested that it was faulty or maybe I just didn't apply it "just right.") That was a nice thing of them to offer so i accepted. I applied the film in the evening when i knew i wouldn't be getting a lot of calls, turned it off and let it sit for the night. I even left it off and gingerly carried it to work to keep around. Through the next few days the air bubbles finally left, but it still had the same issues of looking odd. Like my nails had pushed tiny ripples into it. Its not smooth flat and i get comments from people thinking it looks weird too. I think the film works well. It absorbs my nail marks, and any other nicks but i just doesn't look good. I think a hard plastic screen protector looks nicer and will be looking for one very soon to replace this. This was just not to my liking.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0044IK8VU" id="B0044IK8VU-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-02:</strong> I have had the Skinomi TechSkin on my HTC Inspire for almost 2 years now and it still works great. When the screen is on, you can barely tell there is anything on it. It protects the screen and wipes off very easily.My only regret is that I was not patient enough with it. I waited the full 24 hours after applying it, but there were still some bubbles there. Instead of waiting like I should have, I tried to force the bubbles out and ended up with little stretches in it. You can only see the stretches when the screen is off, so I lived with it. I recently got a TechSkin for my Kindle Fire and didn't make the same mistake. After the first 24 hours, there were still some small bubbles, but after a few days everything cleared up and now it looks perfect.As long as you closely follow the directions (watching the videos is helpful) and are patient with it, the bubbles and streaks will go away in a few days.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0044IK8VU" id="B0044IK8VU-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-06-14:</strong> This screen protector is nice.

The vent is hard to get to work right, but is adjustable and works if you have to use the vents. The suction cup works great, but can be more difficult to get to stick over time. I mostly use the dash mounted for my car and the suction cup for use in other vehicles. The arm of the unit tends to loosen over time and needs to be tighten using a screw driver. Sometime adjusting my phone in the holder results in the holding device coming off the arm unit, which is the most annoying feature.  I would probably prefer the mount that's designed for the G2, but this is a good cheaper alternative.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009AQT41G" id="B009AQT41G-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-01:</strong> CD one doesn't hold my gps well.  it falls off now and then.

If you can't figure out what the middle piece is on the air vent mount, don't worry, you probably don't need it. After monkeying with the air vent holder for a day, I decided I wanted to move the location as my air vents are a little close and the steering wheel obscures the screen. Permanent dash mount when the surface is prepped with an alcohol swap sticks very easily and is going no where. My only complaint is that the carriage is small and difficult to squeeze my phone into. I probably could not do it with one hand. By small I mean the depth. My HTC One with a hybrid case was almost too thick for it. I switched to a hard case without the added rubber and it fits a little better now. The arm is very versatile and it could be placed in almost any position. Its not very long but thats why I like it.Edit- After having this product for a month I have concluded that the depth of the carriage is too short to properly grip my htc one with a case on it. The phone falls out whenever I try to go from portrait to landcape by twisting it. If I make it easier to twist, then it flops forward and the screen angles towards the floor. I need something perhaps a little sturdier with a ifferent design on how it grips the phone. I found this product not bad but disappointing.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B009AQT41G', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B009AQT41G', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00918YTVS</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00918YTVS</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00918YTVS" id="B00918YTVS-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-10:</strong> I love that this has a break away design on the swivel.

My wife did not like it, but I gave it to my daughter and see likes it!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B002UZI2QM" id="B002UZI2QM-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-09:</strong> this product is an old item sold by sprint when blutooth first came out. it does hook up easy but the speaker you can't hear out of very loud. i wouldn't recomend. i gave my two i bought away.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B002UZI2QM" id="B002UZI2QM-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-12-15:</strong> Tiny and powerful with long battery life.

I holds good charge and does not overheat. I don't usually don't buy aftermarket batteries and chargers, but after reading the reviews I bought this one and so far I'm happy. Although I have to say it took about 2 or 3 complete cycles before I could notice good charge holds, but I guess that's normal for a new battery.Overall, I'd recommend this battery if you're looking for an aftermarket option.==================UPDATE===========================It's been about 6 weeks now that I'm using this battery and now it holds only 2 hours of charge. Also now I notice that my phone overheats a lot when charging and I use the same chargers in my car and home that I used before. This is why I mentioned before that I usually don't buy aftermarket batteries and chargers because they're cheap for a reason.I'd recommend just paying the extra money and buying the original battery.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005HBAJ1C" id="B005HBAJ1C-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-27:</strong> This battery replaced, the failing original battery, on my Sprint Samsung Galaxy II, which I suspected was the problem with phone showing fully charged & then just going to almost nothing, probably shorted out internally.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005HBAJ1C" id="B005HBAJ1C-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-01:</strong> This battery seems to last just as long as the original one I had in my Samsung Galaxy Vibrant.

I posted a 3 star review on a 'kit' (2 batteries and charger for $20 on Amazon) as one battery was pretty bad but the other was good. Anker sent me a warranty battery (very nice of them). I was so impressed I ordered another single battery (this one) when I got the warranty battery in the mail. The warranty battery was great (and still is) but the single battery is terrible. Now that is has been a couple of weeks the single battery goes totally dead while the other battery is still over 50%. How can I test this? I have two IDENTICAL Galaxy S 4G (T959v) phones that are NOT being used at all. They have both been factory set and are on ONLY my WiFi.0 charge the pair up and then see how they last SITTING ON A SHELF UNUSED. The T959v might be a great phone, but the T-Mobile Firmware is terrible. I am hoping to root these phones but for now they are stock 2.36 T-Mobile. So the LOT# on the "good battery" is 05GP3F. BTW, I swapped phones to ensure the battery was the problem and not the phone, and the poor battery did just as bad in a totally different phone. Also of interest I bought a pair of Anker batteries for the phones I replaced the T959v phones with and while these phones are in use and DO NOT sit on the shelf, I try to compare them and the battery strength seems to be similar. NOT as good as it was. Not terrible, but it does not make it through the day or if it does it is down below 20%. If I am using the phone a fair amount (never playing music or videos) I will actually see the power drop. I use "Battery Solo" which I find is superb for android battery strength display.UPDATE 1-14-14 So I have done a complete reversal of this review (from 1 star to 5 stars). initially I found and wrote the above, as one of my first pair of batteries was a dud, so I assumed this one was too, but after really watching identical unused phones and doing the battery swap thing carefully (everything being labeled) I found one of the actual phones (both hard reset BTW) does eat up a battery markedly quicker. So Kudos to Anker, and I will buy from them whenever they have a compatible battery for a phone I need a battery for!The lot number on the "bad" battery is 05GP2E.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005HBAJ1C" id="B005HBAJ1C-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-25:</strong> I love them I use for my cell phones it's really very greatest product and last long time to use it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005HBAJ1C" id="B005HBAJ1C-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-12-14:</strong> If you have a Samsung Focus you need this Battery.

I ordered both a replacement Samsung battery and this Anker battery.  Both have been great, a noticeable improvement of battery life over my original one before it failed.  Can't tell the difference in performance, and it's nice having a spare now, esp on those long days at an amusement park when you're using your phone as a camera, letting kids play while waiting in line, but also relying on it to keep in touch with others.The only diff is that this Anker batt is a little thicker.  It fits, but only because the back cover of the S2 is flexible plastic, so I can still snap the edges shut.  But you can feel it's thicker.  If I needed a third battery, I would definitely buy another.BTW, if you've had your phone for a year and plan to keep it another year, buy this batt now.  Way better spending a couple buck now for spare, rather than having it die and then you spend an hour at the store finding out if it's the phone or battery, then spending $49 in the sprint store for only the lesser 1500mAh version because you can't bear to be without your phone for a few days.

After a year, both phones started to behave erratically with reboots, crashes and hangs. At first, I was going to install Cyanogenmod and call it a day but a call to Sprint Tech support said to try replacing the battery. Of course, this is not a covered item in the warranty but I bought a replacement Samsung OEM battery and it did indeed help! I immediately attempted to place an order for another but Amazon stopped carrying the OEM battery!Enter the Anker replacement battery. The reviews for their external battery chargers are glowing so I decided to give it a shot. The only other item from Anker I own is a replacement power cord for a Sony laptop which was given to me. It works great, is lighter in weight than the OEM Sony charger and has not caused any problems. This battery fits perfectly in the Epic Touch 4G, charges at around the same rate, and seems to provide enough juice so the phone doesn't crash, hang, or otherwise act crazy. This battery is also a little more than half of what I paid for the OEM Samsung, so a great deal. If it acts up in a shorter period of time than a year, then I will revisit this review, but I expect this battery to last until we trade our phones in for better models... Maybe a Samsung Galaxy S5?This item seemed to come from "LaptopMate" but was shipped in the amazon box along with the other things I bought on the same order as the ordering process signifies. No problems with any of the order, will order from LaptopMate sold by Amazon again if necessary.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005HBAJ1C" id="B005HBAJ1C-review41" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-23:</strong> Perfect replacement for battery on a Galaxy S2 and this one appears to last much longer than the factory one.

I was underwhelmed at first seeinghow my battery life didn't seem any better than my stock battery. After 3-4 charges it was lasting well and battery was perfect. Did a test where I used my original battery on a slimmed down custom ROM for a day and then the Anker on the same ROM with the same settings. The difference was very noticeable.

No answers. Including company. So, I'm taking the chance. I'll get back to let bm customers know. I do like the price too. But once again. I'm getting screwed on the shipping. If I could have found it elsewhere. I would have purchased it there. I love amazon. But, their shipping cost is a rip off. This purchase is a 2.00 dollar shipment by USPS. So why gouge with a five dollar charge?. I really resent Amazon's shipping cost. Its greedy. Period. ..and yes I will increase the stars according to the quality of the battery itself. ******* EDIT: I did receive a e mail after I wrote here. This suggests that the company does care and is eager to help out when they can.After owning this battery for a month . I will honestly say its worth every penny. Yes, it does fit the Boost Mobile version. Calibrate it, and this battery will last all day under heavy use.

Before, I had to charge twice a day, and if I forgot to charge the phone at night, the battery would be dead the next morning. Now I can sometimes skip a day.

Bought it in September 2011 from Amazon marketplace third-party seller LaptopMate for eight bucks plus shipping & handling. And now, finally got around to writing this review in July 2012.  And the battery is still okay. Bought this battery because it was 1800mAh and the phone's original battery was 1500mAh. Does this battery last longer? Well, the Samsung Galaxy S GT-i9000 was apparently never that great with battery life -- unless if you don't use it. If you use a Samsung Galaxy S GT-i9000 phone like most smartphone users would do, and particularly if you are a heavy user, then it's probably going to last maybe like five hours or so. If you DON'T use the phone at all, but keep it turned on to wait for incoming calls and texts like with a dumb feature phone, then this battery may last for a couple days or so -- and again that's if you don't use the phone at all. But if you use the phone like a normal smartphone user would, then expect to have to charge the phone/battery more often than you may want. If you want to try to extend the life of your battery, you can try using some apps like the "Load Monitor" app and the "Juice Defender" app. (The "Load Monitor" app may also help to prevent the Samsung Galaxy S GT-i9000 phone from randomly shutting down.) Also, if you put too many apps on your phone, that could use up the battery because some apps may stay running in background for one reason or another. This is why my phone currently doesn't have a ton of apps on it. Yes, that sounds dumb, but these android phones always seem to be quirky. Otherwise, it helps to plug in the phone when not using it in order to keep it juiced up, and you may also want to keep your old official OEM samsung battery on standby to swap into the phone if you are caught with this battery running out of power. Nonetheless, this Anker 1800mAh battery was worth getting because it was made by a quality manufacturer and where the 1800mAh was suppose to be better than the  original samsung stock 1500mAh battery.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005HBAJ1C" id="B005HBAJ1C-review53" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-01:</strong> The battery in my Samsung Epic 4g s2 started acting up.

I even tried to get it to wiggle off by jerking it abruptly. Check out the video for the test.The wallet is a really cool feature to me. It adds more functionality than just a standard universal strap. I can see the Tactic useful for the business person who uses an iPad, Android tablet or smartphone on the job in the field or even in the office. It is ideal for anyone who needs security for holding the device for long periods of time.This strap would be a great accessory for the jogger/runner because the wallet can fit your ID and keys and the strap will stay in your hand even if your grip loosens a little. I doubt you would drop your device while jogging with Tactic. If you don't like to use an armband and prefer to hold the device, this will compliment your needs.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DEQ3A22" id="B00DEQ3A22-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-28:</strong> I absolutely love this product!

I thought it would be a more businessy texture.  I kind of try to ignore it.  I took it off of the ipad case because it just feels weird to feel it when you put your hand on your ipad which is more of visual experience.  It works on the iphone 4 case as if it were made for it size-wise - too big for the samsung intensity though.I am keeping it because I ordered it to accomplish free shipping.  I think you naturally will want to slip into the strap rather than feel the strap in the palm of your hand when you hold your device.

I bought two, one for iPhone (4S) and one for iPad 2. One stayed plugged in slightly better than the other, but only marginally. Both easily fell out when my devices would get bumped or if I picked it up. I need to know my devices will be charged when I need them, so for my peace of mind these cables would not do.

I was too impatient to wait and take advantage of the awesome penny deal on Amazon plus I was exchanging my Focus S for the Titan so I took to plunge. (The Focus S is an awesome phone too and I wrote a review last week on Amazon about it. I just wanted to try out the latest and greatest so I traded it in for the Titan)The Titan's screen is HUGE but the phone still fits nicely in to one had. HTC has designed this phone beautifully and almost the entire front of the device is filled by the screen. The bezel on the left and right side is almost nonexistent. This phone is gorgeous. The screen has a resolution of 480x800 which by today's standard is a bit low but you will be hard pressed to even realize this during everyday use. The Windows Phone OS looks fantastic on this screen and text is very easy to read. Videos and pics look outstanding and the super LCD really nails the correct colors accurately. You will love this screen.Under the hood the Titan is powered by a 1.5 GHz single core processor. I am not sure why other OS's require dual core processors because Windows Phone OS runs buttery smooth on this phone. No matter what I throw at this phone nothing slows it down. Microsoft has really done a wonderful job keeping this OS lightning fast.You get 16 GB of storage which for me is plenty. I have a ton of apps, games, music and videos on my phone and still have 9 GB free. Unfortunately there is no memory card slot so the 16 GB is all this phone will ever have. You do get access to 25 GB of free storage on Microsoft's SkyDrive which is integrated well in to the OS so you can always store your pics and docs in the cloud if you run low on storage.ATT markets this as a 4G phone but it isn't true 4G LTE but just the HSPA+ network which is still plenty fast. In Boston my average download speed is right around 4Mbps a second. Not too shabby at all. The call quality so far seems top notch but quite honestly I have only made a few. The signal strength in Boston isn't that great to begin with so at times I am running with only 2 bars of strength. It doesn't seem to impact calls or the internet so as long as things run well I do not care how many bars I have. It is something I will pay close attention to in the coming days and will update my review if things take a turn for the worse. So far things are fantastic though.The sound on this phone is great. It can get VERY loud when using headphones so be careful how far you crank up the volume. The external speaker is quite good for a phone but can get a little distorted when you max out the volume. The phone does not come with ear buds so you will need your own set. This really isn't an issue as most of the earbuds that come with phones are junk but I did find it odd that none were included.I don't want to talk about the OS too much as this is a phone review but for those who have not used Windows Phone yet you will be amazed at how awesome it is. This is the future of mobile now. Once you use this OS going back to iOS or Android is very hard and you will wonder to yourself how you ever got along without Windows Phone and it's brilliant Live Tiles and super smooth operation.While the app store is not nearly as large as Apples or Googles I have found that almost every app I used on my iPhone 4 has a counterpart on Windows Phone. You will also find the Windows Phone versions of your favorite apps look, feel and operate better than the ones on iOS. Wait to you open apps like USA Today or IMDB. They are truly magnificent. If you are a gamer and own an XBOX 360 then you really should be on Windows Phone as XBOX Live is integrated right in the OS and compatible XBOX Live games on Windows Phone include achievements so even on the go you can get those glorious little achievement notifications that some people have become addicted to!That is it for now. I have to get back to playing with my new phone! If you have any questions please feel free to leave comments on my review and I will try to answer them as soon as possible.UPDATE 11/24/2011 - I have had the Titan now for a couple of days and my opinion that this is a fantastic phone is just getting stronger. The battery life is outstanding. I took it off the charger yesterday and used it quite heavily the entire day and when I went to sleep at 11:30 PM I still have about 9 percent left. This phone will easily get you through an entire day.I have also now played with the camera and can say that the 8 megapixel camera takes great photos. Outside in daylight is where this camera really shines. I took some panoramic shot with the built in software and they came out quite awesome. The colors were very accurate. The video recorder works very well too and I got some great outdoor footage in glorious 720p. Taking pics inside the house at night with the flash on hurts the quality a bit but I still think the inside pics look a lot better than the ones I take on my iPhone 4. I think you will be quite happy with the camera's performance.UPDATE 11/25/2011 - Office is absolutely awesome on the Titan. While you don't get to see more of your documents on the screen compared to smaller phones due to the resolution what you do get are documents that are much easier to create and edit. I have noticed this especially while using Excel as each cell is much bigger and easier to manipulate. This phone just keeps getting better and better.UPDATE 12/03/2011 - 4G speeds. After researching 4G speeds on wpcentral.com it appears that AT&T; may be throttling their Windows Phones. In Boston where we have HSPA+ speeds I should be seeing twice the download speeds that I am currently getting. I still average around 4 Mbps which is fine for just about everything I have done so far but it sure would be nice to be up around 8. I am still leaving the review at 5 stars because the phone is still incredible but this is something you may want to consider if you are planning to switch over to AT&T;.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0068PZQT6" id="B0068PZQT6-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-12-13:</strong> I was first in non-existent line on Day One for the Samsung Focus and later had a Dell Venue Pro. Windows Phone Mango is by far the sweetest, slickest and intuitive mobile OS out there, but this is the first real, lust-worthy Windows Phone that does it justice. Everything about it is absolutely gorgeous. It's easily pocketable, don't worry about it being too big. You don't even realize what a monster screen it has until the screen fires up and dazzles with incredible color and pitch blacks. The HTC Hub and Photo Enhancer are much more useful than the Samsung apps on the Focus. Top-notch camera, decent battery life (a day) and the loudest and clearest speakers on a mobile device since the Blackberry Bold 9000. The definitive flagship Windows Phone in the U.S. until Nokia drops their goodies in 2012.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0068PZQT6" id="B0068PZQT6-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-01-02:</strong> I've been using the Titan for just over a month now and there's no way I'm going to back to my iPhone.Pros:This screen is big and beautiful.The overall size is just right for me, even with a Case-Mate Tough Case. I keep the phone in my front pocket and don't even notice it's there.The phone is fast. Games run without lag, apps launch quickly, the screens scroll smoothly, and the phone is very responsive to touch.The camera is incredible. The picture quality is superb, even in low light.Cons:My wireless signal bounces between EDGE and 4G a lot trying to find the stronger signal. This is more an AT&T; issue, although I didn't have this problem as frequently when I had my iPhone.The dual-LED flash is sometimes over-powering.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0068PZQT6" id="B0068PZQT6-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-11-26:</strong> I bought the HTC Titan on "Black Friday" and I must say that I'm very happy with my purchase! Upgrading from a Samsung Focus, I decided to stay with the Windows Phone devices because they are fast, reliable, and fun to use. I've owned an iPhone 3G and a Samsung Captivate (Android 2.1) in the past, but I prefer the setup of Windows Phone 7.5 overall for my cellphone needs.To make this review easier to navigate, I'll break it down into some of the features I consider most important about this device...1) SIZE & SCREEN: Okay, the first thing I noticed about the HTC Titan is that it's one BIG PHONE! Sporting a 4.7" Super LCD screen, the Titan made my old Samsung Focus (4" Super AMOLED screen) look like a toy! Even though the Titan has a large screen, I still find it comfortable to hold, because the body is pretty thin. While waiting for a phone case and holster to arrive from Amazon, I've been carrying it comfortably in my jean and jacket pockets without any problems. You will hear plenty of folks complain about the Titan's lower screen resolution (480 x 800) compared to Android and iPhone devices, but I don't think it's a problem. Everything displays sharply and well-lit on the Titan and sometimes I casually display it in the presence of iPhone and Android users, just to get a reaction ("Hey, look at THAT!"). Anyway, its like having a 60" 720p HDTV (Titan) and comparing it to a 32" 1080p HDTV (iPhone/Android)... give me the BIGGER SCREEN everytime! Bottomline: the Titan has a large, beautiful screen which looks great compared to other phones. Ignore the haters!2) PROCESSOR SPEED: The snappier 1.5GHz Processor on the Titan compares favorably to other phones! For those who are considering high-end Android devices or an iPhone 4S just because they have dual-core processors, rest assured that the HTC Titan is no slouch when it comes to speed. Overall, I noticed no slowdown while using my device to run apps, games, or videos. Windows Phone 7.5 doesn't currently support dual-core processors, but there really isn't a need at this point.3) 16GB MEMORY: Okay, this area is really a shortcoming, in my opinion. Why did HTC only install 16GBs on this beast? Even my old Samsung Focus was expanded to 40GB of memory space! Microsoft needs to really raise the bar in this area, in order to stay competitive. If we are supposed to load our phones with content, why not give us the extra storage space to do it?! Bottomline: HTC needs to expand the storage space to at least 32GB.4) WINDOWS PHONE 7.5 (MANGO): The Windows Phone operating system is a complete joy to use. Using a home-screen comprised of tiles, you can start your favorite apps pretty rapidly with this device. Multi-tasking is similar to the iPhone in everyday use. Just press and hold the "arrow key" on the phone and you will see screenshots of previously used apps or functions displayed like a row of playing cards. Tap the "card" of your choice and you'll be back in that program in a flash! Windows Phone 7.5 also offers great features like Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, Microsoft Office, Xbox LIVE, and Bing integration. Want voice recognition software? Just push and hold your "Windows key" and you can issue a large number of commands to your phone (i.e. "Call Lisa", "Local Weather", "Open Office", etc). Microsoft Office integration is greatly improved on Windows Phone. You can access numerous Office files (Word, Excel, OneNote, and Powerpoint) by storing them on your phone or syncing with an outside source like Office 365, Skydrive, or Windows LIVE! Speaking of Windows LIVE, you can import your contact list and appointments in a flash with this operating system.5) TURN-BY-TURN NAVIGATION/GPS: I had a chance to use the turn-by-turn navigation on this device and its pretty good! You can pair your device to your car's Bluetooth connection (if equipped) and hear the commands over your radio speakers. Miss your turn? Tap anywhere on the map and you'll receive updated directions!6) 4G SPEED: Hey, this Windows Phone has 4G speeds using HSPA+ networks! Try that, iPhone lovers!7) WINDOWS MARKETPLACE: Not something specific to the Titan, but it definitely bears mentioning. As of this writing, the Windows Marketplace has over 40,000 apps available for download. Sure, its not near the numbers available on the iPhone or Android devices, but its still a significant number. You will find popular apps in the marketplace, like Weather Channel, Amazon, Kindle, Netflix, Google Search, and a ton of other useful apps. Most apps offer a "trial mode", so you can try them out before purchasing. AT&T; will let you buy them using a credit card or by adding it to your phone bill. Look up "Windows Marketplace" online and check out the selection for yourself!8) HTC APPLICATIONS: The Titan also has some great apps available for FREE from the manufacturer! I downloaded a Skype-like application (Tango), YouTube viewer, LED flashlight app, weather hub, and calculator.9) 8MP CAMERA/720p CAMCORDER: The Titan has an awesome 8MP camera with auto-focus and multiple settings. Additionally, it has twin LED flash and a camcorder capable of 720p resolution! AWESOME!!Well, I could go on and on about this device, but I'll bring it to a close. If you want to try something different (Windows Phone 7.5) and don't mind having one of the BIGGEST phone screens around, check out the HTC Titan! Its a great phone and I give it my highest recommendation!UPDATE: If you are interested in using Skype on this device, it isn't currently available for Windows Phone. However, Microsoft acquired Skype this year for $8.5 billion, so we should see a Windows Phone version soon. In the meantime, the Titan has a 1.3MP front-facing camera and supports a program called Tango. This program is similar to Skype in functionality and is supported on the PC, iPhone, Android devices, and Windows Phone.UPDATE (10/28/12): Just wanted to mention that Skype is now available for Windows Phone. Additionally, these Windows Phone 7.5 devices are expected to receive an upgrade to Windows 7.8 in the very near future. Although this phone will not be upgradeable to Windows Phone 8, it will still enjoy some of the same features which are not hardware dependent. I would still recommend this phone to anyone, because it is still awesome! The 4.7" screen still trumps the iPhone 5... HOOAH!!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0068PZQT6" id="B0068PZQT6-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-26:</strong> Searh for "Terrible Call Quality" in google and first link will show up...device has basic call quality issue, bluetooth implementation sucks, bad internmet access and several places where other phones are able to get signals Titan is not seeing signals, and this is when it claims to be 4G phone....Iphone 3gs was giving me much better and smooth experience in those areas....If you can sustain with these issue phone is superb, top screen, Mango is just cool os, very sleek looking and good camera....I am using it from day 1 and got several complains about other person had issue hearing me....Update: 03112012Hotspot is another issue if you are using hotspot for over an hour and then try to make a call, it wont call at all (phone is getting hot)if you started hotspot surfing internet  on laptop, then try making a call and laptop internet gets disconnected, why?</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0068PZQT6" id="B0068PZQT6-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-14:</strong> I am as huge of a WP fan as you will find.  I am a great cheerleader for the OS.  It is the best of both worlds:  You can customize, remove, and adjust your homescreen, shortcuts, and app selection as you want.  It is a fantastic user experience- seamless, smooth, and a fun time.  I love the Office tools, the calander is one of the most useful there is, it incorporates your email and social sites so amazingly well, and is a great media/internet experience.That is why the Titan is such a let down.  Call quality is as poor as you can imagine.  There is echoes, garbled reception, and callers on the other end almost can not understand the speech at all.  We have had 4 Titans and this has been true of all of them.  2 of them did not load sites correctly, one had a screen that stopped working, and another would not allow email updates.We purchased the device in November of 2011 so this is a long term problem.  I can not recommend it.  We got the HTC Titan 2, and the call quality was much better, though still not a strength.  We have had no problems with it.  Please avoid the Titan for your own sanity.  If you are in love with the 4.7" screen and like HTC, the T2 is a much better option.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0068PZQT6" id="B0068PZQT6-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-12-20:</strong> I won one of these in a contest, not that it matters as I would have happily paid for it and was up to that point planning on doing so.  This is not my first Windows Phone, but it is my favorite so far.  The screen is amazing, the software is so fast and responsive, and the interface and hubs have made everything I need so easy and fast to get to.  I don't know how I lived with out these hubs pulling in all my stuff, organizing it, and putting it right at my fingertips.  I was not a facebook person before but the integration with this system is so easy and rich that it sucked me in.  If you want the BEST of BOTH Android (hardware/phone selection) and iPhone (stability/simplicity/music experience) PLUS Microsoft Office Mobile AND Xbox Live this is the one for you!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B0068PZQT6', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B0068PZQT6', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00C2SXVEU</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00C2SXVEU</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C2SXVEU" id="B00C2SXVEU-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-27:</strong> very good qualityi really like it</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C2SXVEU" id="B00C2SXVEU-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-04:</strong> This does not close completely which is hard or my husband who is hard on his phones.

However, just as with the dip flip case, wear is a issue. Firstly, the inner contrasting gray is a bad idea because it picks up dirt very quickly. Before you know it you are left with a very nasty looking inner case. The leather like material hold up pretty good. However, after only a months use it begins to flake away on the inner edges of the case. Between the dirt and flaking leather you end up with a case that doesn't present your device very well. As for protection I feel like the case does a pretty good job of that... Also the ports for the speakers are a good addition on a flip case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C2SXVEU" id="B00C2SXVEU-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-24:</strong> We have found it to be a good case with decent protection and little bulk or heft added.

It is very form-fitting and slim, so it does not add unnecessary bulk to this already sizable phone). The leather is nicely stitched and put together ... it looks professional, and you'd be proud to have it next to you on a conference table. One caveat the very top and bottom are not protected (the corners are protected, but top and bottom are exposed), so if dropped in the right place, damage would occur. Moreover, I have had the phone drop from only about a foot or so, and the phone fell out of the case (no damage, but note that the case does not hold the phone too firmly). The cut-outs for volume, power, mic, speaker and camera are excellent. When talking on the phone, just close the case (rather than folding it back) and speak with it closed, as their are cut-outs for the ear piece and mic -- this is much more convenient than folding the cover behind the phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C2SXVEU" id="B00C2SXVEU-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-22:</strong> i like the feel in the hand is pretty nice to hold the phone with the case :D u should get this one</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C2SXVEU" id="B00C2SXVEU-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-03:</strong> The look is nice, it protects the phone, but not comfortable when using the phone.

If you are a member of some clandestine organization,the federal government, or clinically paranoid this is the screen protector for you! If you are fairly "normal" , use your phone for games, movies, reading, texting, video calls or any of the normal functions everyday people use their phone for; then pass on this. I can say anything truly negative about it, except it isn't for everyday use by everyday "normal" people.

I simply show them that It's the privacy screen protector and they're amazed!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003V64M7M" id="B003V64M7M-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-24:</strong> This is the second one i brought, and it's better than the first. Well for me anyway because the first was really dark, during the day i couldn't even read a text. This one ids not very dark, but it does have a way of making things blurry for on lookers. yes i tested it lol. i guess if they try very hard they can read it, but that would take a lot of focus and by then you would know TRUST!!!FYI I PURCHASED THIS FROM  Boho Tronics, WILL PURCHASE AGAIN IF THIS ONE STARTS TO PEAL, BUT THAT TOOK OVER A YEAR TO HAPPEN.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003V64M7M" id="B003V64M7M-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-04:</strong> It does a very good job of protecting my screen from damage but it is not really dark enough for complete privacy but it does help.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003V64M7M" id="B003V64M7M-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-07:</strong> This didn't do what it was suppose to and it kept falling off!!

In addition, lots of bubbles appear on the screen.  Overall, it protects as it says it does with those minor hiccups.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003V64M7M" id="B003V64M7M-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-01-11:</strong> doesnt really protect any privacy at all. can still see the screen from all angles, and it dims the screen. good for protecting your screen but not good for protecting your privacy!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B003V64M7M', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B003V64M7M', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li>
