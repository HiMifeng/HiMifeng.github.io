Bought two in different colors...  These are keepers..  Hold on to it because people want it for themselves :)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004BSF1I8" id="B004BSF1I8-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-05-04:</strong> Works perfectly fine on both: iPod Touch 4G and iPad 2! Well balanced (not too light, not too heavy), good grip, the best part's its tip - looks solid and rubbery (silicon) in comparison to my "POGO sketch" stylus (threw it away, as soon as I got that one)). Really great not just for drawing, but basically for anything. I barely use my fingers any more. Everything can be done with it; tapping, swiping, scrolling, etc. Didn't care much about its pen (which is PARKER btw!!!)... oh, well, why not right? Totally worth $16! Highly recommend this product!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004BSF1I8" id="B004BSF1I8-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-04:</strong> After trying out a ton of different styluses, this was my favorite. It was just the right weight, not too heavy or light feeling, and the pen wrote very nicely. The nib was just the right softness - not overly squishy but had enough resistance to perfectly control the writing when trying to draw on an iPad.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004BSF1I8" id="B004BSF1I8-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-05:</strong> I was expecting a better quality tip on the stylus end.  It seems flimsy with the potential of tearing easily.  I've bought cheap styluses before...always to my regret...and this one feels no different from them.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004BSF1I8" id="B004BSF1I8-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-12-19:</strong> There are two major flaws in this stylus.1. The cap does not fit on the back of the pen, therefore when you are writing with the pen you have to be extremely careful and make sure you do not lose the cap.2. After a couple weeks of use, the stylus tip became increasingly "grippy" and now it is almost impossible to write with. It is fine for tapping but drawing and writing is very hard now. The stylus did not glide well from the beginning but it is now significantly worse.I give it a 3/5 because integrating a pen with the stylus proves to be quite useful since it only requires me to bring around one writing utensil. It is also fairly durable and still looks brand new after a few months of having it in my pocket every day.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004BSF1I8" id="B004BSF1I8-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-06:</strong> Weight of the pen was nice, the pen portion wrote great and the stylus worked great on my ipad.  However, the pocket clip bothered my hands when using the stylus , although I admit they are pretty large. The stylus tip went bad after about a year or so but thats great quality when you consider that I left it in my pocket wherever I went and used it to take notes in class, on draw with friends, and have random pen adventures like drawing on drunk people.  Will buy another one of these or another one from Kensington as the quality was great.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004BSF1I8" id="B004BSF1I8-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-29:</strong> This is a very handy device to have when I travel.  I prefer to use a stylus with my Kindle and often needed a pen as well.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004BSF1I8" id="B004BSF1I8-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-12-20:</strong> Bought a couple of these pens on sale to carry with me when I'm out and about as I travel a lot and never seem to have a stylus or pen handy on me.Pros:- built-in Parker pen - writes very smoothly!- longer body than normal stylus and even the Rocketfish comparable stylus/pen combo - makes it easier for us with bigger hands to use- good weight - most styluses are too light in my opinion, this one feels like a very good pen- grip is comfortable- works well as a stylus, not great, but good- price was very good- attractive - the styling (other than the clip) is very visually appealingCons:- the body is slimmer than other comparable models - I prefer a thicker pen to a thinner one- the clip on the cap ends in a ball, which I have never liked - probably because I tend to play with it when holding it and then the clip gets worn out or pushed to the side too much- the clip is very thin and not as sturdy as the Rocketfish modelRecommendations:- replace the clip with something more sturdy and without the ball- consider making the pen a bit thicker for an easier hold, though this is a very nit-picky suggestionOverall, I like these styluses/pens and am happy I bought them at a good deal.  I also own several of the Rocketfish ones and think that the two are comparable - with the Rocketfish having a bit extra girth for a better hold, while the Kensington has a better grip - its a toss-up to me and I'm happy to have both and would probably buy whichever one is cheaper at the time.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004BSF1I8" id="B004BSF1I8-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-05:</strong> Worked great for a while, but the stylus end is completely useless after a few months of heavy use.Pen writes well but it feels a little short in the hand.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004BSF1I8" id="B004BSF1I8-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-03:</strong> I particularly bought this pen since I am a student and I am constantly having to write and use my tablet when I am taking notes. It writes really well and the stylus is above average in my opinion. However, when writing I am constantly losing the pen cover since it can't cover the stylus part of the pen.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004BSF1I8" id="B004BSF1I8-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-09:</strong> This is a great looking pen.  It writes easy and feels good in my hand.  Thanks to the cap design, I will never forget whether I'm in 'pen' mode or 'stylus' mode.  The stylus side works great as well.  It's held up from daily use pretty well, though the clip has worn through the rubberized exterior to the underlying metal.It's easy to take apart and reassemble.  For the money I think it's a good choice.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004BSF1I8" id="B004BSF1I8-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-01:</strong> I purchased this for like $6.00  when it was a Gold Box deal. I would never pay the original msrp of $20.00 for this. The stylus works good on my Nexus 7 and my Galaxy S4. The pen portion works but it's not impressive. It would be nice if once you took the cap off to use the pen you could put it on the opposite end while your writing. The cap will not fit over the stylus portion. Overall, I have no regrets with my purchase.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004BSF1I8" id="B004BSF1I8-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-07:</strong> From the sound of the one and two stars it's a good thing not to buy!GriffP.S.

I have a Nexus and the pen tip doesn't register even when I take the screen protector off.  Also I noticed that the pen tip itself isn't properly installed, the ball in the pen gets stuck and doesn't rotate smoothly which could scratch the screen.  The fat pen tip works but you can buy those for a dollar so this was a waste, and too heavy.  At least it was a cheap buy so I don't feel too bad about it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004BSF1I8" id="B004BSF1I8-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-19:</strong> As in the title, I'm very fond of the stylus. It works...well, like a stylus does. The entire thing is built very well and it will feel in your hand like you're holding a nice accessory for your tablet, phone, or touchscreen computer. It often caught people's eyes at meetings at work for me. It's certainly a neat and convenient little gadget.The pen quickly became one of my favorites. It writes really smoothly and makes clear and dark marks without running. I found myself using it instead of my normal pens at times, even when I had no use for the stylus end. Unfortunately, the pen quit working about a month after purchase. It was neither out of ink nor exploded, but its ability to draw ink became totally hit or miss. I'd scribble all over paper until it would begin to write, it would work for a word or two, then run back out. It became too frustrating for me to deal with.It takes Parker refills, but that ended up explaining the entire issue for me. I had the same experience with a Parker Jotter pen. I probably wouldn't buy it again, especially since the Parker refills on Amazon are apparently counterfeit. Not sure if a stylus is worth that level of upkeep, anyway.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004BSF1I8" id="B004BSF1I8-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-06-30:</strong> I was disappointed, upon receiving the sylus, that the cover does not fit over the stylus end when using it as a pen. Why not? Why would you possibly not design it like this? Bummer. And, after a day in my pocket with some other metal objects, the entire black coating got scratched off revealing the brass metal underneath. And the kensington logo is half scratched off (not the worst thing in the world).Plus, compared to a normal pen, this is much smaller and not very comfortable if you have large hands.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004BSF1I8" id="B004BSF1I8-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-19:</strong> I really like this stylus and pen combination. I use it with my ipad and cell phone. The only thing I would add would be a clip so I don't risk losing it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004BSF1I8" id="B004BSF1I8-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-02-18:</strong> The Kensington Virtuoso Touch Screen Stylus and Pen (i.e., the Kensington 2nd Generation Stylus and Pen, as Amazon lists it), measures 5 1/8" from the stylus tip to the end (by my own measurements). This makes it nearly an inch longer than my BoxWave Capacitive iPad Stylus, which is 4 1/4" from stylus tip to the end (not including the part protruding from the end that allows the user to attach a short string to the BoxWave at the other end of which is a plug that can be stuck into the iPad audio out port). Please note that BoxWave now has a stylus on the market that is virtually identical in appearance and function to the Kensington Virtuoso, called the BoxWave Styra. I haven't tried one and that is not the BoxWave model I'm comparing the Virtuoso with. I have big hands (x-large size gloves, larger if available), and the extra 7/8" in length really makes a difference in stylus holding comfort. Plus, it enables me to move my fingers back further on the stylus so that my fingers are further from the iPad screen, which is especially useful when I am using the SketchPad Pro app.This is subjective, but it seems to me that the Kensington tip glides a bit more smoothly on the iPad screen than the BoxWave, but it also seems that I have to tap the screen a bit harder with the Kensington than I do with the BoxWave in order for the screen to respond.Both styli are equally slim, and while I prefer fat pens (e.g., Dr. Grip) for non-digital use, the slimness of the Kensington and BoxWave styli seem to make them easier to use on the iPad's smallish screen, at least for me. I've tried grips on these styli and while this felt comfortable, I did not like how it affected my visual experience of my hand over the iPad (I'm left-handed and like most lefties I have to hold my hand above whatever I'm writing or drawing on - paper or touch screen, meaning that my hand is already in a position that tends to block what I'm working on, so this is a factor that may not be an issue for right-handers).If I could only have one stylus, I'd choose the Kensington, because of it's longer length. That it has a built-in ballpoint is nice in that it's convenient, though the cap cannot be placed over the stylus end when the ballpoint is in use.Another plus to this type of pen (this would apply to the BoxWave Styra, which is also a stylus/ballpoint, but not to the BoxWave listed at Amazon as the "BoxWave Capacitive iPad Stylus"), is that the cap that covers the ballpoint and that has a clip on it rotates, whereas the standard BoxWave clip does not. This matters to me because I find it uncomfortable to use the stylus when the clip is resting against the part of my hand between my thumb and forefinger, and because the clip on the standard BoxWave (and I imagine on other styli that are not stylus/pen combos) does not rotate, this means that the user is always applying the same part of the stylus tip to the iPad screen. It may take a long time for the tip to begin to wear to the point that it interferes with the stylus's functionality, but having to use the tip in only one position is kind of like having to use a pencil eraser on only one edge so that it wears down unevenly. (A user on an iPad app forum reports that he literally wore a hole in the tip of his iPad stylus after heavy use over time.)Finally, I suggest that anyone considering this stylus check out the video review of it for which you can find a link (to YouTube) Kensington's page for the Virtuoso at their US website (Amazon deleted the link from this review, so you'll have to find it via a search).I should add that it's a very nice looking pen. I have a pen collection, mostly fountain pens, and for a cheap pen (compared to the kinds of pens collectors tend to collect), this pen is good quality and looks like it's good quality. The no-name brand ballpoint ink cartridge is the fat type, and in the video I mention above the reviewer (Josh Smith from Notebooks dot com) says that the cartridge can be replaced with "a standard Parker refill."</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004BSF1I8" id="B004BSF1I8-review19" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-07-20:</strong> I picked this stylus over others because of the length, and the fact that it incorporates a pen. It's useful to have the pen occasionally. I prefer gel ink, but this one writes very smoothly.As a stylus, there are times when taps do not register. Not too often, and in general it is more accurate and registers more often than my fingertip, so I guess it is an improvement. The soft tip seems a bit too soft, and after 2 weeks of using it seems to flex a bit too much, especially when swiping. I'm worried about it breaking - I'll update this review if it does.Room for improvement : a cap for the capacitive stylus end would be nice. A way to retain the cap of the pen would be nice as well. I'd also prefer something thicker so that it is easier to grip.Overall, works well, fairly inexpensive for a capacitive stylus, includes ink pen with replaceable refill, and is a nice length.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004BSF1I8" id="B004BSF1I8-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-30:</strong> Cursive writing kind of looks like a 3rd grader and it is a bit difficult to carry around.

Never did I dream that I would buying one after another. I had simply trusted all the reviews that I had read and which each of the successive styluses I purchased. In general, I found that most styluses I tried were lacking in one or both of these two areas.1. How well they slide on the touch screen.2. How they feel in your hand.I found the Boxwave and the Roocase lacking in the first area. They were inconsistent in they ability to provide comfortable flowing kind of  feel that I've come to expect having used roller ball and Uniball pens for years.I do like  both the AYL and Allupen. In fact, I have given both positive reviews. The AYL and the Allupen both had that silky feeling I was looking for, but at the same they both have their quirks in terms of feel. The AYL is kind of lightweight the feel is slightly cheesy. The cigar sized Allupen is heavy and tended to slip out of me fingers especially if I was writing while lying down (one of the advantages of Swyping!) I actually had to put skateboard tape on it to keep that from happening.Which brings me to the Kensington Virtuoso. I'll be completely to the point on this. It slides easily and now that have used it for a few days, I can confidently say that, out of all the styluses I have, it feels just right. The gun metal version I have has a non-slip texture and some a bit of classy weightiness to it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004BSF1I8" id="B004BSF1I8-review22" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-05:</strong> This is my favorite stylus so far. It has good length and weight and feels like a pen in your hand.The precision is better than Boxwave.The New Trent has the best point in my opinion as is very reasonably priced but is much smaller and lighter.The ball point works fine and is a nice bonus.Unless things have changed it is only available in black and blue.

It's been on my phone for about 3 weeks now, and it looks just like it does the day I put it on!

After reading reviews for several similar products, I finally decided to get GreatShield Ultra Anti-Glare (Matte) Clear Screen Protector Film. Honestly, I was not disappointed.The instructions were easy. I like that the film doesn't fully extend and cover the whole front of the phone, leaving a a cm of space from the edge. This is good especially to those who has a phone case cover that hugs and extends towards the front-face of the phone (like mine does). However, lining the upper film cut-outs to the phone takes a bit of time. The anti-glare/matte finish works great even under direct light. The cover has a high quality finish which doesn't impair the phone's touch screen. Price is affordable.TIPS for a lint/bubble free application:1. Use a small drop of rubbing alcohol. This dissolves any fingerprint oils & easily air drys.2. Use tweezers to hold the film.3. Apply film in a relatively dust-free room that has minimal air current.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00872R5SI', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00872R5SI', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B009RQJM3Y</h2>    <p class="price"> $B009RQJM3Y</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009RQJM3Y" id="B009RQJM3Y-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-05:</strong> At first, I didn't know if I would trust Sanyo for batteries.

I've used others, but the quality and reliability of these beats them all.  A few things I like and why I just bought 8 more of these third generation units.1.  Repeatable quality and made in Japan.  These all charge within about 50 mAH of each other.  I routinely see the capacity at 2000 mAh as measured on a MAHA C-9000 smart charger.2.  Low self discharge - that's the big advantage of these.  I use them in bluetooth keyboards, mice, trackpads; in remote controls; in weather sensors (yes they work outside at 10 below zero in Nebraska); in cameras, in headlamps, in flashlights.  In short, I use them in everything that takes a AA battery.I have bought all kinds of rechargeable over the years (and I've used rechargeable for as long as they have been on the market, starting with NiCad, etc.).  I have used Powerex,  Energizer, Radio Shack, LaCrosse, Rayovac, just about all the brands.  Now I've stopped buying the others and standardized on the Sanyo's.  I have a dozen or so of the 1st Gen, another 20 or so of the second ten, and now 8 of the third gen.  I'm getting rid of all the other brands I have that don't work as well.Don't let the 2000 mAH rating fool you and don't buy just for huge capacity.  The larger capacities self discharge much more rapidly and can't take the same number of cycles.In short, you can't beat these for reliability and quality.  The others are not as good.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009RQJM3Y" id="B009RQJM3Y-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-10:</strong> I've been using eneloops for years, and they just keep improving them.  We have a bin that we keep our charged, and discharged batteries in.  The kids always know where to go for batteries, and no one ever has to feel guilty about using batteries in our house!  Out of probably 80 of these in circulation in our home, ever sense we started using them years ago, only 1 has leaked, and that was during recharge. We've never had any others fail, or fail to recharge, although we do use a smart charger/conditioner, and I often wonder if it's a little too sensitive because sometimes it won't fill them all the way up.  We always have the charger discharge them before a charge so we can accurately determine how much charge is placed in them.  However, sometimes it might read them as FULL even though they're only 50% according to the amount of charge placed in them.  So when it shows the end of a charge cycle, we always look at the amount of current put in to the battery, and f they don't get at least 2.0 Amp hours of charge, they get discharged/recharged until they absorb at least 2 amp hours (2,000 mAH ) during a charge cycle.  This has maximized their run time in devices, and cut down on the ones that are driven to reverse polarity.  Occasionally though, they will still fail to charge in our smart charger when one gets driven to reverse polarity by other batteries in a toy that gets left on.  In that case, we simply connect them in parallel to a charged eneloop for a few seconds then pop them in to the charger, and they always come back to life with plenty of capacity.  My only regret is not keeping track of how many batteries I've recharged since we we started using eneloops.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009RQJM3Y" id="B009RQJM3Y-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-22:</strong> The vendor (MYBATTERYSUPPLIER) is the best when it comes to supplying you with the product as advertised.

Later I also used theSecond-gen eneloopbatteries around 2010. Now, this product featured here ("NEW Sanyo Eneloop 3rd generation 8 Pack AA NiMH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries") claims to be the latest addition to the eneloop family, with an advertised lifespan of '1800 cycles'.I have tested a set of those 3rd-gen eneloop AA cells, using myLa Crosse BC1000battery charger/analyzer. Here are my findings:- Date code on each cell says '12 - 08', which means August 2012- Right out the package, the open-terminal voltage of each cell is 1.32V- The average remaining charge is measured to be 1490mAh, or 75% of the rated '2000mAh' capacity. The spread (max - min) is only 13mAh.- After the first recharge, the average capacity jumps to 2060mAh- After two more recharge/discharge cycles, the average capacity increased slightly to 2083mAh. The spread is still very tight (min=2060, max=2110).The above behavior is nearly identical to my past test results for 1st- and 2nd-gen eneloop cells. Therefore I'm confident that those are indeed genuine Sanyo eneloop batteries. But how do I know whether I'm getting 2nd- or 3rd-gen eneloop cells? The only way to tell is from their part numbers: 2nd gen eneloop AA cell is marked 'HR-3UTGA', while 3rd gen is marked 'HR-3UTGB'. (See the image I uploaded to 'Customer Images' section for a comparison between three generations of eneloop cells)One remaining question: is it worthwhile to get those 3rd-gen eneloop batteries over 2nd-gen?- Lifespan:According to Panasonic (who bought Sanyo in 2009), the main improvement of 3rd-gen eneloop is its longer lifespan of 1800 cycles verses 'only' 1500 cycles for 2nd-gen. But keep in mind that even if you recharge your batteries twice per week, it will take nearly 15 years for you to use up 1500 cycles.- Self-Discharge Rate:Panasonic claims 3rd-gen eneloop can retend 85% of charge after two years in storage. In contrast, 2nd-gen eneloop is rated for 85% after one year, 80% after two. I have previously tested a set of 2nd-gen eneloop AA cells after two years in storage. They retained 1685mAh, or 84% of rated capacity. This suggests there is negligible difference between them.My recommendation:If you already own a lot of 2nd-gen or even 1st-gen eneloop batteries, there is no rush to replace them with 3rd-gen version. On the other hand, if you are looking to add more rechargeable batteries to your collection, then it certainly helps to feel that you are getting the latest and greatest eneloop product - even though in practice you can't see the difference.Side Notes:- The batteries are made in Japan. The package is printed in English and German - obviously intended for Europe.- The 'Free' battery holder is functional but nothing to get excited about it. My one even has the label 'TENERGY' printed on it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009RQJM3Y" id="B009RQJM3Y-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-17:</strong> I now have eneloops in almost everything I use AA or AAA batteries, and C and D adapters for other things.

First off, the rigid (yet flexible) back snaps on the cell phone quickly, easily and stays securely on.  Next, the texture on the case is easy to get a grip on yet it still will slip in and out of you pocket without any excess friction (unlike many flexible, gel like cases).  The holster has a very strong, multi-position belt clip which is comfortable on the waistline and won't break off like my old Blackberry holsters used to do.  When I use the holster, the phone is easy to get in and out of the holster yet it stays put when it is inside of it.  Lastly the stand is excellently designed for either vertical or horizontal viewing. This comes in very handy when I travel; it makes it easy to watch movies on the plane.  Oh - and the case is still slim enough to fit the docks that I purchased before I got the case; nice added benefit.I can not think of anything I would change on this product.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008B85DNC" id="B008B85DNC-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-04:</strong> Great holster for galaxy 3 holds phone securely.The phone will not come out it will also protect the screen.

It is relatively easy to to take it in and out of the case and slide in and out of the holster. Well designed case and the best part is that it is really slim so it does not add much bulk to the phone. It allows the phone to be used comfortably even when the phone heats up from extended use. It does everything you need from protecting the phone to allowing it to stand in either portrait or landscape mode including the belt holster option.

It looks fine! I love the kickstand! I can pop it out and sit it on my desk while working! I'm not sure how long it will last before breaking, but it looks more sturdy compared to some of the other ones I've seen like the ones built into older HTC phones. One bonus feature I've found is using the stand as a "finger loop" to increase grip on the phone. I absolutely HATE the "big screens" that these Android phones have. (The iPhone 5 screen is perfect!) On several occasions I've tried to use my Galaxy one handed, tried to reach for a button at the top of the screen, and almost had the phone slide down and out of my hand! With this case, I can loop my finger thorough the stand so if I loose grip of the bottom of the phone, it won't slide out of my hand and crash to the ground! If your a person that isn't careful with your phone and drop it all the time, this case isn't for you. It won't protect the phone from a major fall. In that case, look at an Otterbox. But if your like me and need something functional and isn't too bulky, this is the perfect case!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008B85DNC" id="B008B85DNC-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-08:</strong> I usually drop my phone within 2-3 weeks of getting a new one. So after I bought my GS3, I ordered this case. First impressions are good, solid feel, non slip surface, and the clip on the holster is sturdy. It's also real thin and doesn't add too much to the size of the phone. My only complaint is that the case doesn't protect the ends of the phone (see my photos). So if you drop it, and it lands on the end (like mine did), the phone will get damaged (like mine did). Other than that, the holster is a good design and the case feels solid. For the price you can't beat it, but if you're a fumble finger like me, get a more protective case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008B85DNC" id="B008B85DNC-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-28:</strong> Love this case!

I had the HTC Incredible version for years and I loved it.  The built in stand for the Samsung GS3 version is easy to use and is pretty stable, in either landscape or portrait mode.  The case is strong and looks good.  The holder is tight without being too tight.  Although I don't use the holder all the time I like having it if I want it.  The only downfall, and this NOT the case's fault it would be the same with most any case, is the fact that the SGS3 is such a pretty phone I feel bad about covering with a case.

Having this case & holster while using it for transport in an out of the car, house or work helps minimize the chances of you dropping the phone.  I don't think it will offer much protection even if it were dropped but that's the point to help you from dropping it.

But, when I bought a leather pouch for it, like my Motorola Droid used, I was less than happy, and pretty afraid for its survival.  The leather pouch for the S3 was too big and floppy and I found the lid coming open on its own.  So, I gave the Shell Holster a try, and WOW!!It has such a slim profile that I barely notice it.  The material the case is made out of has excellent grip in my hands and on counters.  The holster and case mate so perfectly together that I never worry about the phone falling out of it -- something that worried me terribly when I first ordered it.  It has never once come out of the holster unless I did it myself, and I have used it in some very active environments.The case edge on the screen side has a lip of about 1cm and protects the screen when laying down on anything reasonable, and when dropped, you never have to worry about the screen touching the surface (unless that surface is like a bed of rocks or something).  The hard shell of the case absorbs so much energy when dropped and distributes it evenly around the entire case to keep the phone from feeling too much in one spot.The hinged kick-stand is wonderful and I use it all of the time.  I like to read on my phone, and I use the calculator a lot, so the kick-stand comes in very handy.After a year and a half, I am now buying a replacement.  I had my phone on the kick-stand at the edge of a table yesterday and my daughter clipped it with her elbow when walking past.  It must have landed at a bad angle on the kick-stand itself -- one of the plastic hinge pins bent.  When I tried to put the hinges back in their holes, I broke the pin.  My rating stays at a 5-star because this little guy has gone above and beyond in its service to me.I have, and will continue to recommend this to everyone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008B85DNC" id="B008B85DNC-review36" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-06:</strong> This is a great case.

The case that attaches to the phone is a sturdy hard plastic with a surface that is easy to grip but it doesn't protect the top and bottom edges or, more importantly, the four corners of the phone. This seems like an inexcusable design flaw! The pictures of the case mounted in the holster lead you to believe that the phone is protected on the corners - not so!I also agree with other reviewers that noted that the phone can leave the belt holster without any action other than body movement. Avoid this case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008B85DNC" id="B008B85DNC-review38" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-09:</strong> I bought my Aduro Holster Combo Case eight months ago under another name; I love this thing! It comes as a two-piece case/holster system. The case holds my Galaxy S3 in a smooth hard rubber material with well-formed cutouts for all the jacks, controls, camera, etc. The grippy case resembles very hard car tire rubber, but smooth enough that it does not snag on my pants pocket when I whip it out (snort!) The case wraps around the sides so the screen does not touch the desk when you lay it face down. It is cut away at the top and bottom to expose the jacks, however, so there is still a danger if you drop it.My favorite feature by far is the built-in kick stand. I often use my Galaxy S3 as an e-book reader and movie viewer. The stand does an excellent job of positioning the phone either horizontally or vertically for easy viewing without adding bulk. Big ups to the design team!I rarely use the holster section of the case, but this is the best design I've ever seen. You can use the case by itself, or you can slide the S3 face-first into the holster. This forms a slim, highly-protected rubberized shell that protects the Galaxy S3 against even serious drops and impacts. Amazingly, you can still access the various controls and jacks inside the shell, though the volume control is somewhat awkward in this configuration. I wish the clip on the back was removable, though.At the price, the Aduro Holster Combo Case really earns its five stars!UPDATE: The thin sliver of plastic over the volume button finally split after eight months of use. But I love this case so much I bought a new one! I'm still posting five stars.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008B85DNC" id="B008B85DNC-review39" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-21:</strong> This case not only protects my phone it also make it easy for me to carry around my phone and also answering it</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008B85DNC" id="B008B85DNC-review40" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-11:</strong> Aduro Shell Holster Combo Case for Samsung Galaxy S4 with Kick-Stand & Belt Clip (AT&T;, Verizon, T-Mobile, US Cellular & Sprint)I got this for the SAMSUNG GALAXY S4 and for the price you can hardly beat it...I paid only $4.99 and that was a significant factor in making the decision to buy.I also like the belt clip that swivels 90 degrees in either direction, and I think the case provides reasonably good protection, though would definitely have a screen protector on the phone.I've had mine a short while but I don't see unit falling out from the belt clip.  Phone has to be properly attached to the clip meaning screen facing the felt and slide in until secure-there's even a placard on the inside of the clip advising of this fact.I also really like the retractable stand - just be gentle with it.An added plus is  material construction-will not slip from hand when holding phone.This is not my primary case but I certainly like it and believe it deserves 5-Stars when price is taken into consideration.*Update 7/13/2013:  Do be mindful of price fluctuations!

The phone fits solidly into the part with the "kick stand" and then you slide the encased phone into the mating part of the case that has the belt clip. The case seems well made, not sure how long the kick stand will hold up as it has some folding plastic parts and sometimes these tend to tear and break after repeated folding. But the clam shell mating part of the case that has the belt clip is a great feature and really protects your phone should you drop it and ofcourse for guys who like to clip the phone case on a belt it is a nice feature. The phone slips up and out easily when you want to use it. My biggest problem will be to remember to keep track of the belt clip part of the case when I am talking on the phone, I have a tendency to set things down in my home or office and forget where they are!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008B85DNC" id="B008B85DNC-review47" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-06:</strong> This is the best case on the market for your samsung galaxy 3S hands down, don't waste your money on anything else.

The case seems of decent quality: it's hard but easy to install and remove.  There is very little to no edge protection -- specifically, I had a (perfectly installed) screen protector on the phone (Samsung Galaxy S3).  I pulled the phone out of my front left jeans pocket and the screen &#34;grabbed&#34; the edge of my pants and peeled right off.  If there were edge protection, this would not have happened.  Since then, I've gotten rid of the screen protector as this happens every time.I use this case only once in a while when I want to show it off or actually watch some content on the phone.  I don't think it offers much protection and when I'm active (which is a lot), I go back to my Otterbox.At this price and usefulness (when installed), I would still buy it and for folks who are not so active, this is probably not a bad case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008B85DNC" id="B008B85DNC-review57" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-13:</strong> The case and holster fit perfectly out of the package.

Originally I went right to the Otterbox Defender case/holster combo, and ended up being pretty dissatisfied with it. The quality was lacking both with the case and the holster.I had the Arduro combo in my wishlist for a long time, to try if/when I wanted to try something else. So it arrived a little over a week ago.I have to say it's a nice case and holster combo. I work in a warehouse environment, so I'm carrying lots of boxes, bending over, kneeling down, turning wrenches, etc. So far the holster has held up well. I keep in one my right side, and so far have not had any trouble with the phone popping out.I also like that my slim phone is slim again with the well-fitting case. It certainly isn't going to provide the protection that the Otterbox did, but It's much easier to remove if I need to. I probably won't have a need for the kickstand, but you never know.I can also get to the buttons more easily than with the Otterbox, which made them more difficult to push.I'm always reticent about these style holsters, however. I went through three of the Otterbox Defender holsters. I don't know if this one will hold up, but as inexpensive as these are, I'll probably buy one or two more just to have replacements when they break.I'm hoping that some day someone will make a holster that doesn't have a cheap plastic clothespin-style clip, but a spring-steel clip instead. I'm not holding my breath...Bottom line, I recommend this.Update 12-18-13: I purchased a second case/holster combo, to have a backup holster if/when the current one breaks. None of these companies seem to sell replacements for the part that breaks the most, the holster. Oddly, I used the same link to order the new combo, but the seller was different. The first one arrived within a week, this one will take at least a month. So beware of the seller when you're buying this. If you need it quickly, do not buy from Morecubes.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008B85DNC" id="B008B85DNC-review78" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-09:</strong> The casing is made of a durable, tough-looking plastic that fits around the Galaxy S3 perfectly. It's fairly easy to snap the case on and off the phone (not that you need to do this much). The kick-stand is a nice touch and doesn't add much to the extra thickness of the phone. As others have commented, the holster is worthless and it's easy to lose your phone if you depend on it. I keep my phone in my front pocket so I discarded the holster and have been happy with the casing. The exactly same item is in retail stores at $30 so it's a great bargain for this price.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008B85DNC" id="B008B85DNC-review79" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-08:</strong> The Aduro Shell Combo Case is outstanding. The case attaches securely to the back of my Samsung Galaxy 3s smartphone. It has a textured surface that significantly improves my ability to grip the unit and it also has a very nice fold-out easel for when I want to see my smartphone display on a desk or table. The Aduro Combo Case also adds firmness and structural support to my Galaxy 3s.The case also does not interfere with a holder that I purchased to hold my smartphone when it is attached to my car windshield.The holster is well-designed, very sturdy, and attractive.

The lips of the case prevent the phone's screen from being scratched if you lay it screen-down.  The case cut-outs work well, so camera and charger functions are unaffected.The case can be easily removed if needed.  The rough diamond pattern texture of the case makes it easier to hold than other rubber cases.The belt clip has worked fine so far; however, I do not like wearing the phone on my belt simply due to the phone's size.The kickstand is helpful for media; however, it will likely break over time.  The kickstand is held in place with little slide-in clips, which broke on my Samsung Droid Charge case after a few months.  The quality of this is similar, but this is not a deal breaker for me.  I still would have bought this case even without the kickstand working.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008B85DNC" id="B008B85DNC-review82" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-27:</strong> I like it .

It fits the SG3 very snug and should offer decent protection of its back.The belt holster is also well-built with a nice matte finish.  It has metal re-enforcement in places that matters.  And the slim case mate with it perfectly:  not too loose so that it will slip out and not too tight to take it out.I have only had it for a week.  So far, love it.UPDATE:After using it for a few more weeks now, I lowered the rating to 2.  The cause of the deduction is to the case itself, which is very form fitting and way too tight fit.  As a result, for those of us who occasionally need to take it off to use the spare battery, it is an ordeal.  So tight fitting that after a few times, while taking off the case, it stripped the power button off the phone.  Thank god the power button appears to be modular and easily plugged back.  It still functions well, but the button is now wobbly.  As a result, I am no longer using it for fear of stipping off other buttons, such as the volume, etc...</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008B85DNC" id="B008B85DNC-review84" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-07-18:</strong> This is the greatest case i ever used .

At the same time i need to protect my $600.00  You don't even realize there is a case on its because its so low-profile.Whats best is i love the holster  but some times i like it in my pocket with this case i can have my cake and eat it too.I saw this case for 29.99 in a store and was happy to find here for way less.

But I'm not to sure about everyday use.  The outside of this case is very slick.  If you lay your phone on a slightly slanted surface with this case on it, it will slide off.  Especially if you have it on vibrate and someone calls or texts you.  I'm tempted to try and use a very fine grit sand paper on it just to see if it helps, but at this point I only use this case when I plan to use the kickstand to watch a movie on the phone.  Also, the case fits really really snug.  The first time I removed my phone from the case, it pulled off the on/off/lock button on the side of the phone and I did not know this had happened until a few minutes later.  I was really lucky to find the button and was able to put it back in the phone.  So overall, I would recommend to use only if you intend to use as a backup or if you intend to watch a movie on your phone.  But not as an everyday case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008B85DNC" id="B008B85DNC-review87" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-12:</strong> works perfectly will use it daily, fits well into holster, hugs phone well, buttons are not impeded at all looks good, protects phone</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008B85DNC" id="B008B85DNC-review88" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-19:</strong> Love it.

It fits perfectly and has the nice little 'flip' stand if you want to prop up the phone on a table.

It isn't perfect, but it certainly does a very good job for the price.Pros:- Rubberized texture is good for hands but doesn't stick to everything and collect lint like some other cases- All buttons and ports remain accessible whether in the case or not- Headphone jack is usable with 90 degree headphone plug (last case needed straight, slim plug)- Kickstand is surprisingly rugged and does a good job.- Case doesn't add much thickness or weight to the phone.- Low profile edges allow for easy scrolling and do not inhibit any touch screen usage.- Belt holder part of the case is very convenientCons:- Phone can get easily knocked out of the belt loop part of the case, especially when worn sidways, I stopped wearing it sideways.- Phone case plastic is starting to crack around edges after only a few gentle removals.- Case does not protect top and bottom edges of screen from damage.- The camera is always facing outward.  If you are a conspiracy theorist, you might not like this.  Nothing electrical tape can't fix.This case does a very good job at ergonomics without infringing on the use of the phone.  It is very convenient and even looks pretty sleek too.  The kickstand is wonderful since the Samsung phones don't have them built in.  I thought the sliding case might scratch the screen or at the very least peel up the edges of my screen protector.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that it is designed very well such that the screen is given adequate clearance even when sliding it in and out of the belt loop holder.  It is also nice that I can access the volume controls even while it is in the case, for when I am riding my bike or motorcycle.The biggest flaw with this case is that the phone can be very easily pushed out of the belt holder (especially when worn horizontally) even just by a shoulder bag, or a hand when carrying things.  I have often found the phone half out of the holder when I wore it horizontally or even at a 45 degree upward angle.  One time I had a shoulder bag which knocked my phone out onto the sidewalk.  It also allows it to hit the ground at the perfect angle, right on the corner which is unprotected.  As such, even with the case, it still cracked my screen and I had to get it replaced.  I have since started carrying it directly up and down and it seems to have fixed that problem.I still highly recommend this case as long as you can handle it being straight up on your belt.UPDATE:  After wearing the case vertically on my belt now, I have not had any problems with the phone getting knocked out of it anymore.  The only down side is that it is slightly more awkward getting the phone out of the holster vertically as opposed to horizontally.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008B85DNC" id="B008B85DNC-review102" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-13:</strong> Had a case like this for my motorola droid rarz.

The case isreally great product it protects the screen from contact when placed face down. the kick stand is probably the best of any kickstand cases I have seen in that it is a fairly wide base in either portrait or landscape orientation. it has a very snug fit on the case itself and the cutouts are very precise. I especially like the fact that you can charge the phone even when in holster. as mentioned in another review the holster has a fine felt material on its interior this looks like it may actually give a minor amount of fingerprint removal just by installing the phone in holster. I also recieved a screen cleaning mitt. Overall I recommend the product just don't expect it anywhere near the estimated delivery date.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008B85DNC" id="B008B85DNC-review116" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-23:</strong> This is a great case for the Samsung Galaxy S-3.The back has criss-cross lines that provide a non-slip texture to the phone. This helps when you are using the thumb to operate the phone while it rests on just your palm and fingers.The folding stand allows you to keep the phone in landscape or portrait mode, and snaps back in flat when folded and takes up no extra space.The build is very sturdy.The small ridge along the face of the phone provides a slight ground-clearance for the screen. The phone has fallen a couple of times on pavements and sidewalks from small heights, and the screen is still in mint condition.Highly recommend this case for S3.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008B85DNC" id="B008B85DNC-review117" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-08:</strong> Got this for a guy.

I was looking for a slim case with a kickstand to protect my phone while maintaining some of its thin design (since that is one of the main selling points of the S3 - that it is so thin).  I am very happy with both the price of this case and with the protection it offers.However, be aware that this is not the most protective or heavy duty case that is sold for this phone.  This case is made of hard plastic, so if you drop it, the case will not absorb much of the impact the way a gel or silicon case might. Also, if you have your phone on a desk or night stand, when it vibrates, it will be louder than usual (this might not be a bad thing for some people, but it bothers me, so I thought I'd mention it).The case also does not cover the very top and bottom edges of the phone. This is not a big deal to me, but again, this is not full protection for your phone. If you are looking for a super protective case, get something like this:Kickstand Hybrid Case Hard Gel Cover with Stand for Samsung Galaxy S3 I9300, I747 - Black and White- only draw back of that case is that you will loose all "sleekness" of your phone.This case is very difficult to remove once you place it on your phone. I took it off once to install a screen protector, and I scratched the edges of my phone while trying to remove it. It was very difficult to remove, so don't get it if you plan to "case swap" frequently.I love the "kickstand" feature, although I mainly use it to slip my finger through it while I am holding the phone in my hand. It works great to improve my grip on the phone while I am holding it. As far as actually working as a kickstand, it works just O.K. You have to make sure you open it all the way until it snaps so that it will hold the phone up vertically. It is not really sturdy, and it has tipped over on me a few times. When using it horizontally (or landscape) the kickstand works better and is much more sturdy.I have not used the holster part of this case much, but when travelling, I use it to protect my screen while my phone is in my travel bag to go through airport security. Other than that, I do not use it, but it is nice to have, and if you do use it, I believe that it would provide excellent protection for the screen (I just use my phone too frequently, and it would be a hassle to have to slide it out of the holster each time I want to look at it).In summary, there are many options for cases out there, and after a lot of research, I believe that this one provides the most protection for the money, while still maintaining some of the slimness of the Galaxy S3 phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008B85DNC" id="B008B85DNC-review122" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-07-19:</strong> I've had similar cases for my previous phones and like to have a slim holster for when I'm in a suit or business attire.  I have two cases for my S3.  This one and the Diztronic white case that is a good amount thinner and covers the entire phone (I can use it and this holster too as they fit).  This case fits the phone very snuggly (a bit difficult to remove regularly) and provides good side and back protection.  The bottom & top are open and I fear would be damaged if dropped directly on them.  Admittedly, the Diztronic caseDiztronic Matte Back Clear Flexible TPU Case & Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S III (Sprint, AT&T;, T-Mobile, US Cellular, Verizon and International Carriers) [Diztronic Retail Packaging] is too thin to provide much protection either.

The packaging left me slightly concerned: it arrived in a cheap, plastic bag, but that's the least of my worries and it's better that way. The shell holster itself, however... isn't really made of shell. It feels more like hardened but flexible plastic, or a really soft shell material. It feels like the exterior is made of faux leather. One thing's for sure though: the phone FEELS safe, and it's really cool and comfortable to touch. The case is very easy to put on the phone, and easier to put on the holster. The belt clip is excellent and able to stay on your pants or belt no matter how much you move.I have mixed feelings, however, about the kickstand. To use it, you basically pull it back and slide it down until it &#34;clicks.&#34; When using it, the kickstand will keep your phone upright guaranteed, whether sideways or vertically. However, the phone in the kickstand itself is prone to being knocked down if you're using it to play a game, for example, or for occasional tapping for things like Netflix. This is because the kickstand itself does not have &#34;rubber stoppers&#34; on its &#34;legs,&#34; if you know what I mean. It won't stay stable and you need to put something hard and big, like a book, on the back of the kickstand, so that the phone stays in one place stabilized.For what I want it, however, no real complaints here. I strongly recommend this combo!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008B85DNC" id="B008B85DNC-review124" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-20:</strong> Most reviews I read about case & holster combos for the Galaxy SIII were frustrated because the screen protector caught on the case as it slid into the holster.  Soon the screen protector begins to peel off at the corners and edges.  But, this case solves that problem by having slightly higher edges to keep prevent the screen from scraping when sliding the case into the holster.  I looked at a lot of cases and this was the best, but it offers less protection on the corners against breakage when dropped.  I have never dropped my phone -- and I have insurance anyway through Best Buy with $0 deductible and with accidental damage coverage for $8/month (paid for 24 months within 30 days of cell phone purchase).  I highly recommend this Aduro case and holster combo.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008B85DNC" id="B008B85DNC-review125" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-09-19:</strong> I love my galaxy S3 so much, especially how thin and elegant it is. But I was disappointed at how slippery the body of the phone is. I couldn't even keep it on my leg without it slipping off and falling. So I decided I needed a case, and the thought a case with a kickstand sounded really attractive (after all, with such a large screen, I tend to watch a lot of video on my device). I was really concerned with making my device bulky, and so I deliberated for several weeks before deciding to try this case. I was super happy when I put it on my phone and saw that it barely added any bulk to my phone. Plus, it made it feel a lot more "manly," a feature that I wasn't expecting. Another reviewer had also mentioned that the plastic is not too "grippy" - but I've found that it adds enough grip to not slip on any surface. I don't use the clip-cover, but I'm very happy with the kickstand-case. The kick stand virtually disappears when you don't need it, and it does take some finger nails to pull it out - but it's super strong and does it's job well.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008B85DNC" id="B008B85DNC-review126" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-22:</strong> I got this for my fianc&eacute;  he is too cheap to buy a nice cover so I found this one which he really likes for such an inexpensive price.

I'm not using it because I do not feel the phone cover would protect my phone from even a modest drop.  The corners of the phone are completely exposed. Its too bad because I really like the holster. I don't see any reason why the manufacturer/designer couldn't have extended the protection around each corner of the phone.  Weird.UPDATE: 4-9-13  I'm using it.  I ordered a holster for my Otterbox Commuter and it didn't work at all.  So for the time being I'm using this.  Again, I'm VERY concerned that if I drop the phone it will break.  Also, the phone just slides into the holster.  There's nothing holding it in so when you sit down say in your car, the phone slides right out.  (I have it oriented horizontally on my belt all the time)  I'm constantly pushing the phone back in the holster.  I have yet to use the kick stand however, it seems to be of good quality.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008B85DNC" id="B008B85DNC-review129" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-13:</strong> I got this for my husband who is very picky.

I've owned two: one for the Rezound with the extended battery and this one.  The unit is made out of tough, ridged plastic in a diamond pattern.  The shell is thin but sturdy and fits the back of the phone securely, leaving comfortable space to handle the volume and power buttons and space for the headset and USB jacks.  The shell and phone fit securely into the holster.  The holster is of the swivel type.  The part that the glass of the phone fits into is covered by smooth felt and won't harm the gorilla glass.  The holster has a clip that fits snugly on a belt, the clip swivels so that the phone can be carried horizontally or vertically.  Out of the holster, the ridged back makes the shell easy and comfortable to hold.  The shell has a kickstand on the back so that the phone can be placed upright in either portrait or landscape mode.This is a good unit, and I recommend it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008B85DNC" id="B008B85DNC-review136" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-26:</strong> I have purchased more than a few cases for my galaxy S3 &#8211; I will not mention how many :). This is the best case I have purchased! I was so tired of constantly looking on Amazon & EBay, then receiving the cases only to be disappointed. Thankfully we have these venues with reasonable prices as opposed to purchasing at Verxxxx, AT&x and Best xxx etc&#8230; where the same cases in most instances are triple the price. The mark up is crazy and I refuse to pay it, I can wait a little longer for a case to be delivered and save $20+ bucks. I have finally stopped looking after I purchased two Aduro&#8217;s . A superb case! All of the cut outs around the case are perfectly placed. The texture of the case not only looks good it is also helps gripping the phone.  At the time of my review, 2, 006 others have already reviewed with 1,369 five star reviews. I change batteries often and getting the case off is kind of hard but it&#8217;s worth it to have a tight fitting case for protection. I do not understand why people constantly harp on this for this case and others. Tight fitting cases typically offer better protection and will not pop off if the phone is dropped. I have dropped mine twice. Loose fitting cases in my mind do not serve any purpose other than superficial.  The main purpose for most cases is protection.  The kickstand is great and does not add any bulk.  I do not always use the shell holster mainly because I&#8217;m a woman and I do not have anywhere to hook it too &#8211; but I do like &#8220;hooking &#8220; it to my jeans while I&#8217;m running errands etc&#8230; It&#8217;s also great to have when walking the dog or just walking, hook it on and listen to music &#8211; hands free.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008B85DNC" id="B008B85DNC-review137" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-17:</strong> This case is so awesome!

It took me 6 months before I couldn't stand it any more.- I would avoid this phone if you are thinking of buying it. -The "click" screen is gimmicky, and tremendously painful to use when it's acting up.When it's working right I can see why it was a design decision - it is an interesting concept, but I can not understand how this product possibly made it through engineering and testing.Issues that you will experience when you own this phone:1) The screen will double and triple click on you2) The screen will fail to register where your finger is touching. Touching the bottom right of the screen will highlight the buttons in the top left3) One or more of the electric click sensors in your screen (one at each corner) will stick down. Failing to register any clicks in that quadrant no matter how hard you press. If all 4 corners go at once, the screen is unusable, and you need to pull your battery.4) Your click sensors will strangely start clicking themselves when your finger is nowhere near it. I had a condition happen multiple times where the phone, laying on my desk would click and unclick rapidly, like it was vibrating. This continued for a half-hour before it ran out my battery.Before anyone comments that "your phone was defective" - I brought it into a Verizon store, and they told me that it was normal behavior for this phone, and RIM recommended that a battery pull be performed every other day to reboot the phone, and clear up issues like this. Hardly a consumer-ready product.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003YHOXFY" id="B003YHOXFY-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-03-11:</strong> es un excelente equipo. trabaja perfecto para movistar Venezuela, la calidad de las imagenes es muy buena. ninguna queja con el equipo, ademas solo se conseguiran refurbished porque el equipo no salio mas</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003YHOXFY" id="B003YHOXFY-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-09:</strong> The greatest thing about this phone is the suretype.It is sad that blackberry has done away with probably best ever typing feature called suretypeople.Can never go wrong.the words come upvlike magic.The call quality is good and the email set up awesome.It is impossible to beat blackberry as a communication phone.Great stuff.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003YHOXFY" id="B003YHOXFY-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-15:</strong> Wow i remember when I first purchase this phone I was in love its a great phone but I guess now we have better phones around.

Verizon version is unlockable so you can take it international or switch to T-Mobile or AT&T; (but they stink, so forget that). SurePress screen is perfect for someone such as myself who has had a hard time adapting to touch-screen technology. 3G signal is typically outstanding in NYC area where I live. Phone is reliable. I have dropped it (in an Otterbox case) dozens of time and it has yet to have any damage.Cons: Old and no 4G. Out of date OS software. SurePress screen slowly grows stiff. Not a lot of aps. No longer manufactured.Other Thoughts: My Storm2 is now 28 months old. It has taken a beating and keep on ticking. The SurePress screen has slowly grown a bit stiffer, but I just play with the adjustments to get it back to the way i want. Sometimes a hard reboot also helps. I have Verizon and did switch to T-Mobile when my contract ended, but they only give you EDGE on this phone so the slow speed and T-Mobile's lack of coverage just pushed me tight back to Verizon. I don't play games on my phone and the only web based stuff I do is checking my auctions if I am bored while waiting for the subway, so I see no reason to upgrade. WiFi and Bluetooth work a-okay here. Storm2 connects with ease to my TomTom.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003YHOXFY" id="B003YHOXFY-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-04-07:</strong> Every thing was sent to me except the 16 GB Micro SD card.

As a result, I can compare the Blackberry Storm 2 from Verizon and the Blackberry Bold 9700 from T-Mobile.  Similar phones in many respects with shared capabilities in the main but one is far more user friendly than the other in my opionion.  The Bold is the friendlier one by far.  As an aside, I am impressed by the level of service and follow-up by Verizon and the Storm 2 over T-Mobile but that's another issue for another time.The Storm 2 is quirky.  Maybe the same can be said of all touch screen devices but it tends to lock up, accept the wrong commands and is tough to navigate with those smallish querty keyboard symbols.  And you have to toggle between screens to add numerical data and certain punctuation marks to your text.  The Bold, in comparison, is not like typing on a regular keyboard either but it does allow for easy fixing of typos and with its chicklet fixed keyboard makes navigating a far easier task.And that's the main difference between the Bold and Storm 2:  Ease of navigation.  It's sort of like going from the original version of Windows (Storm 2) to Windows 7 (Bold 9700) if you follow my drift? The Storm 2 does have an advantage in the user being able to go from portrait to landscape mode which helps a little on typing text but even then, the keyboard is not forgiving.  The Storm 2 now has four sensor modules under the screen to help on the commands which is a step up over the ONE from the original Storm but stability is hardly the order of the day.Sending a text requires an additional menu call-up on the Storm 2 as opposed to the Bold. Also, on the Storm 2, one has to dig into the media icon to access the video camera.  Not so on the Bold.  More examples outlining the differences between the two phones.  In summation, I like both phones but the Bold would be my choice if I could only have one phone.  I think the Storm 2 has another generational change ahead of it before it can lay claim to being a true iphone alternative.You have to think the people at RIM and Blackberry are acutely aware of the Storm 2's issues because the phone is just short of being an all around excellent choice.  Right now the Storm 2 is a GOOD choice and I'll leave it there.UPDATE:  After many dropped calls in spite of good wi-fi or antenna 3G strength indicated, and having the Storm lock up on me after taking it from the charger, I couldn't continue and got out of it and the contract.  I'm beginning to think the folks at Blackberry and RIM have been not only passed but left in the dust by the competition.  To be fair, the Bold 9700 has been and still is a solid unit which I have no desire to replace.  The Storm2 is Blackberry's Edsel Ford given my short, costly and sad experience with it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B003YHOXFY', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B003YHOXFY', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00JGFGNIS</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00JGFGNIS</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JGFGNIS" id="B00JGFGNIS-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-20:</strong> This is the first time I have tried a charger from this brand, and in fact, until recently had never heard of Qifull. As more and more devices become equipped with built-in Qi wireless charging capability, I have noticed that the number of companies offering up chargers is expanding quickly and prices are quickly falling. This is the first time I've seen a Qi charger with a built-in battery of it's own, allowing you to charge your phone wirelessly while on the go. This seems like an awful lot of functionality to receive for the price ($43.99 at the time of this review), so I have to be honest, my expectations were low.The QT80 arrived well packaged, albeit in a fairly plain looking box. It makes a solid first impression when taken out of the package; it feels like it has a very solid build quality. Enough weight that it doesn't feel cheap, but not so heavy that it would be cumbersome to use, I think they got the feel of the product just right. In fact, if it weren't for having small visible seams on both sides of the product, it almost looks like an Apple designed device. The bottom of the device has four small rubberized nubs that give it great grip when sitting on any surface, which is important so that you don't knock the device around when placing or removing your phone. The top is fairly plain; there is a raised rubberized &#34;ring&#34; in the center with the Qifull logo printed in the middle. On one end of the device, there are two ports; a micro USB port where you plug the charging cable, and also a USB port that you can use to power non-Qi enabled devices (phones, mp3 players, etc) with a normal wired connection. On the other end of the device, there is a simple power button, a blue notification LED, and a 4-light battery meter with green LEDs to show you how much power the charging pad has remaining.I own a Nexus 5 phone with built in Qi charging capability, and I have been using the official Google Nexus Wireless Charging Pad for a couple months now, so I have some experience with Qi. This QT80 is significantly larger in size, in fact it's almost the same size as my Nexus 5 phone, slightly thicker. Right out of the box, I pressed the power button and sat my Nexus 5 on top to see what would happen. I was immediately greeted with a *beep* to let me know that the charging had started, and my phone lit up like usual to notify me that it was charging. The beep is a nice touch; it's just the right calm volume to alert you that your charging is successful, but it's quiet enough that it wouldn't even wake or bother someone sleeping next to you. Very nice to see that a company got the volume of this notification correct. The blue LED lights up to show you that it is charging; again, it's easily visible if you are looking for it, but it's a muted enough LED that it wouldn't bother you if right next to you while sleeping. Qifull obviously took their time to get this right.I haven't taken specific measurements but even when running on battery pack, it feels like it charges my phone at the same speed as my plugged in Nexus Charging Pad, I am very impressed. As mentioned before, this also has the capability to charge other devices via a USB cable. Pretty awesome...if you're on the go, you and a friend or coworker can both charge your phone from this at the same time, no fighting for time on the charger. The built-in 7000mAh battery is fairly substantial. Wireless charging isn't the most efficient method of power transfer but the pack provides enough juice to fully charge my Nexus 5 one time, which is more than I would ever need.To be fair, not all is perfect with the product and packaging. One thing I found a little weird is that the product comes with two different lengths of micro-USB to USB cables, but does not come with it's own wall charger. This problem isn't an issue for most people, since you can either recharge the battery pack from any computer, or plug the USB cable into the port on any wall charger that comes with any smart phone, but it would have been nice if they included one, even if they had to take the price up another buck or two. And my second minor gripe, is that the product comes with a short flip out instruction manual, which is helpful but the English translation is very poor which might give people a bad impression of the product. For example, one random sentence picked from the instructions word for word: &#34;The involved images are sketch maps, the final product as per the material subjects&#34;. OK, if you say so!Overall though, I not only was overly impressed and surprised by the quality of this product, but I was also very impressed by the many different applications for it I began to find in my daily use. Great tool to keep in a briefcase to quietly charge a smart phone during a meeting or while sitting at a coffee shop or restaurant without easy access to a power plug. This truly is a product that solved a problem I didn't even know I had, and now that I own it, I couldn't imagine not having it around as a backup on the go. Highly recommended for anyone with a Qi-enabled phone who wants a great charging solution both at home and on the go.A sample of this product was provided for purposes of writing an unbiased review.

It is grayish black, with 4 grey anti skid feet on it, and very handsome to look at. I think it is great that I can charge my phone, and no wires are required! So, if I am changing rooms to work, I can just carry the Qt80 and my phone where ever I go, and place them down, and my phone just keeps charging...no plugs required!I no longer have to look for an outlet, and instead of searching for a cord to plug my iPhone in, I just place the phone on my desk, on this small Qi pad, and it is automatically charging. It might not sound like much, but in the two days I tested it, I have found my iPhone is almost always fully charged all the time. This, just because of the convenience of being able to easily place it on a pad. Plus, you can use this to charge another device via cable.The Qi pad comes with it's own .3m micro charging cable and a 1.5m micro charging cable. The manual says it supports 1 Amp devices, like digital cameras, other phones and MP3 players...but I digress).The unit is approximately ~5&#34; x 3.3&#34; x .6&#34;, with a weight of ~7 ounces. The color is a grayish black (very handsome), it is light, and has a small footprint, with 4 anti skid feet on it, making the unit very very stable on my desk.This is a great in home/office unit, and is so convenient. Smart idea...I love it!If interested, I bought a Qi case for the IPhone 5s and it is working great.As I use it more, if I find out anything else important, I will update my review.UPDATE: 6/12/14:I was told that there is a high failure rate with the Qi's and the IPhone, so I want anyone considering this to realize that. This unit is NOT being sold as Apple compatible. I have had the unit tell me a few times already today that it is not compatible, but when I take the iPhone in and out of its case, it must reset it, because then it works.I will update as I see how it works in the coming days. :)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JGFGNIS" id="B00JGFGNIS-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-19:</strong> Use for my SGNote 3.

I was confused by the colors of the LED on the device-- it glows green when nothing is on it, and blue when I put the phone on it, never to turn blue again. I would expect blue could mean ready, read or blue charging, and green when done. I'm not sure why I was confused about this.Overall it is simple to use, works well and other than those couple caveats I was pleased with functionality.By a lot of patient hours, days and years of reviewing, I found myself in the top reviewers on Amazon.

It would not look out of place on a office desk, side table or bed stand. Very intuitive to operate and simple to use. Just plug it in via wall plug adapter or USB 2.0 into computer/Laptop - a LED will turn green indicating that the pad is charging in "standby mode". Place the mobile phone on top of it - the LED turns blue indicating that it is charging properly. If the phone is placed incorrectly on the pad, a high pitched sound & green flashing LED will alert you.If you need to use or answer the phone, just pick it up; no attachments and no cables to unplug.The main caveat is that the device to be charged must be Qi (chee) or CE capable to charge wirelessly (as indicated by a logo that looks like a circle with an "i" in the middle).Wireless receiver modules are available to add to a non-compatible phone. I have added one to my Samsung Galaxy S4 and to Galaxy Note 3; the S4 took up to 3.4 hours and the Note 3 up to 4.2 hours - for a full charge.The battery capacity is 5V/1500mAh with an expected efficiency of 70-80% (as all chargers).

Here are my comments.1. This is simply a charging pad. It will NOT charge anything unless the included micro USB cable is attached to this unit on one end and a power source at the other end. There is a different model Qt 80 that can also function as a portable power pack without being connected to a power source.2. This has a nice sleek look and is the size of a "phablet" (a term that denotes smart phones that are larger than usual but smaller than a tablet): 5 7/8 x 3 1/8 x 3/8 inches. It takes up little space on my desk at work. Because it's so thin and light it's ideally suited for travel.3. I have my iPhone 4S in a Qi case and this unit charges it fine. It also works with my Nexus 2013.4. There is a blue light on the bottom front of the unit to indicate that it is connected to a power source. When I place my iPhone on this unit there is an audible beep to indicate that it has started charging. There is another beep to indicate when it is fully charged.Bottom line: As Qi technology becomes more popular (Starbucks has reportedly made a deal with Duracell to have wireless charging in its stores in the future), the price of simple Qi charging pads keeps dropping. This unit works well and is reasonably priced.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JGFGNIS" id="B00JGFGNIS-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-14:</strong> The QT30, Qi-Enabled charger is a small, but powerful smartphone charger.

The base layer of this case is very rigid and the seam from the injection molding was rough and sharp against my skin. The plastic is so rigid that I had difficulty pushing the volume buttons independently of one another. In fact, the plastic is so rigid that I didn't feel at all confident that it would provide any sort of protection if dropped from more than a foot off of the ground. Additionally, the plastic outer layer was so slick that it was difficult to hold the phone and it slid off of everything. Very annoying.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00I85Z74I" id="B00I85Z74I-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-02:</strong> Item exactly as stated!

The color is a perfect mint color and it fits my phone great.  The case comes with a card to stick in the back slot of the phone so you can prop it up if you wan to sit the phone down while you look at it.  Although this is handy, its not something I would use.  I did try it out and it doesn't prop it as nicely as some phones with the kickstand already built into the stand.  This case is a little heavier and adds some weight to the phone, but I myself like the extra weight because it makes the phone feel more sturdy in my hand.  LOVE THIS CASE!

I see a lot of complaints that theirs doesn't work and keep in mind that this case is actually designed for the SGH-D710 model of the Galaxy S2.Another thing to know is that the product picture is not what you get. It's mostly similar, but not exactly the same. I will post a link to a picture that demonstrates the difference (I submitted one but it never was posted).That said, this case works only okay with my SGH-T989, and my son's SGH-T989 and my daughter's SGH-T989 and you get the idea. There is, however a glaring difference in putting it on the phone. We tried doing it the way another reviewer did it, in a video but failed time and again. It does not work for this phone. We finally were able to put it together (for the most part) using these steps:1.  First place the inner hard back cover inside the silicone cover.2.  Place the phone inside that.3.  Lay the front frame on top of the phone and carefully pull the silicone over the top edge of the cover.4.  Gently, press the edges together to ensure tightness around the edges.Because the inside part of the case doesn't snap together either before applying the silicone or even after, I'm a little skeptical that it will actually resist any impact. I suspect that the front part will come flying off if I drop it.In the end, I likely would not recommend this to any friends. I'll use it, since I have it, but I'd suggest looking for another type.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00713P0BS" id="B00713P0BS-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-27:</strong> The phone is very protected by this case but I can not hook it to my wire in the car so I can hear my music that is on my phone.

Patience is the key to replacing this.  The glass on my phone was shattered to pieces, so it took considerably longer for me to get all the tiny pieces of old glass out.  After about 45 minutes, I was done, and it works perfectly.  No issues with anything, but I was concerned with how it was shipped (it was loose in a small box!), but it was unharmed.

The HDMI from your TV doesn't supply juice to power your device. So when putting out the signal to your very large TV I'm assuming the video card needs the extra juice (more than batter can provide) to send the signal out to TV. Hence you need to have the tablets charging system plugged into this adapter while using it. My wifes Kindle Fire HD doesn't need this extra charging when streaming it to TV, but the video sucks and is pixelated/grainy. Video on this Samsung adapter is much better.Still giving it five stars because I knew about this charging thing going into it. And I'm pretty happy with the video quality.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CJOP9O2" id="B00CJOP9O2-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-21:</strong> I am so happy with the purchase of this item.

It fills the screen and the sound is fine. As far as picture, the quality dips slightly when transitioning from the Samsung Tablet to my Toshiba 46". Overall, i am able to watch a movie no problem. Once you play a movie, the TV should recognize the incomming signal and automatically play your movie. Its a handy gadget for digital media. Instead of renting a DVD, I can stream media to my tablet and watch it at anyones house that has wi-fi.You do have to use your own power cord which some people complain about, but its really not that big of a deal because you already have it with your tablet. Overall, its not too bad. Its not a dock, but it works just fine.

I'm not sure if this is a feature of Jelly Bean (I'm running 4.1.2) or of the adapter itself, but either way it's super.  I've also not had any issues with sound, something that has plagued me with another HDMI tablet (Motorola XOOM).

It doesn't support a lot of HDMI output modes, and the ones it supports are weird (black bar at the bottom).  It doesn't work with a separate HDMI-to-VGA adapter, outputting no signal at all through it.The adapter may be useful for playing back a movie on a TV set, and it may even look OK if you fiddle with the settings.  But if you want to use the Galaxy Note 10.1 for presentations in a professional context, this adapter is so poorly designed and cumbersome that you might as well not bother.  That's a shame because presentations with the combination of touch screen, pen, and HDMI output would have been great and a nice replacement for a laptop.

The screen was very clear, and the camera was very good.  The performance was much better than a Samsung unit that I used to have. The memory and storage is very generous and sufficient for most users. There are a few items of bloatware on this device, but unfortunately everyone seems to include their own on the phone.  The user interface is not the usual android, although once you get used to it, it does everything that other interfaces do.Now to the negative points. The phone would not recognize 32GB cards, not even 16GB cards.  It would only accept 8GB cards.  The card enclosure was very flimsy, and that might have been the problem, although I am not sure. The phone deleted a few of my applications after I rebooted the system.  I guess that was the last straw.  I sent it back.  The positives of this phone are much better than other phones of the $120 range, and I am hoping that I got a rare dud. I could be tempted to go back and try another unit of this phone again, hoping that the other unit will not have the negatives of this one.Update for the second unitThis device has good telephone, camera, and display. The general performance of the computer part of this unit is very good - for things such as GPS, WIFI, mp3, download speed, and battery life.  Unfortunately, there are a few rough edges on this phone. The phone does not accept some memory cards (five out of the six that I tried) .  The camera settings are a bit primitive.  The autocorrect feature of the email text is very primitive.  These defects are annoying but tolerable.  I tried calling the customer service on these issues.  The one time that I was able to get through, the representative could not offer any helpful suggestions except to send the unit back.  All other times, the line was busy.All told, this is a middle-of-the-line unit, and it is priced very reasonably - less than half of the known brands with the same specifications.  In all fairness, even the known brands have their own flaws and rough edges.  I am changing my original rating of two stars to four stars.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00B7NAFI6" id="B00B7NAFI6-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-30:</strong> I purchased this phone in hopes to replace the smart phone I purchased while in the Philippines (Cherry Mobile Flare).  The Blu Dash 4.0 D270a doesn't quite stand up to the performance of the Cherry Mobile Flare, but since the Flare doesn't work in the United States, it is a pretty close replacement.  Overall I'm pretty pleased with it so far.  But like anything there are positives as well as negatives with anything.  Some of the specs provided on Amazon and Blu's website ([...]) are a little off.  Not anything major but I will run down those and the minor negative points of the phone in this review.[website & amazon specs]:4GB with 512MB RAM; Dual Core 1GHz Cortex-A5; 5MP camera (main)/ 0.3MP camera (front); 4 inch screen / 480x800 pixels; Android 4 operating system; Dual Sim Card GSM 850/ 900/ 1800/ 1900 Mhz/ UMTS 850/ 1900 Mhz; 3G HSDPA (AT&T; only)/GPRS/EDGE/Wifi; Wifi hotspot capable; A-GPS support; SMS/MMS messaging; micro sd card support up to 32GBThe only thing I found to be a little off, was the main storage size of the phone.  The phone reads in settings, and also in other apps I have downloaded, that the total size of the hard drive is 2GB not 4GB.  That's a nice chunk of space for the phone, but I still put a 32GB micro sd card in it for more storage.  The 512MB of RAM is not that impressive, but it handles most of everything I need my phone for.  If you are the type of person that likes to download a lot of games, maybe it won't be enough for you.  The Android version is 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich.I currently use AT&T;'s Go Phone service and the phone had no problem identifying the network.  I wasn't sure if I would have to manually enter the APN settings, but the phone picks it all up automatically.  I've had another unlocked phone with Unnecto, and I had to enter all that info in manually which took some time to research.  I use the second SIM slot for my Philippine SMART sim card.  It reads it just fine, and is set to roaming (which uses the AT&T; network).  The good thing is that this phone will also work when you travel abroad.  I have not used T-Mobile with this phone, but according to what I've read, the 2G connection will work, but the 3G will only work with AT&T.;  The fact that the phone also has the ability to be a mobile hotspot is also a plus.One annoyance that I've found with the firmware of this phone is setting up certain contact info and ringtones.  For some reason the phone would reset certain contact settings I had made to default.  The problem has seemed to stop, but it was irritating at first.  Trying to set custom ringtones for contacts is also an annoyance.  Unlike the Cherry Mobile Flare I own, Blu Dash 4.0 doesn't give you a menu in the sound settings to choose from your custom MP3's.  You have to open them in the audio player, and then set them as your main ringtone for sim 1 or sim 2.  I have yet to find a way to set your custom ringtones for individual contacts.  When you go to set the individual ringtone for the contact, the regular ring tone menu pops up, and is all that you can choose from.Another downside to this phone, is that I haven't been able to find much as far as accessories go.  I contacted BLU through their website, and they referred me to an online dealer that had some BLU accessories, but nothing for the Dash 4.0.  It would be nice to have a skin or case to protect the phone, but they just don't have one out that I know of.  Universal screen protectors are easy to find, so you can trim them to custom fit the phone no problem.  I've also tried a few different headset/mics in this phone, and only the one that came with it seems to work properly.  The others will work as a headset, but the mics won't work for some reason.  I have not tried to use this phone with a blutooth headset, but the phone is blutooth capable.Battery life is not the greatest.  If you are using the phone pretty regularly to surf the web, or download apps it drains the battery faster.  Certain apps can also eat the battery pretty quickly, so I've found that disabling them when not in use is the best way to avoid killing your battery.  When using the phone moderately, the battery has lasted through out the day, but usually by night, you will need to plug it up.Overall, I would say that if your looking for a dual sim smart phone that won't break the bank, the BLU Dash 4.0 D270a is a pretty good choice.  Blu also offers other smart phones with better specs, but they are quite a bit more expensive.  $130.00 was more than what I paid for my Cherry Mobile Flare, but I don't think that you will find anything in the United States this cheap without having a contract phone.  Unlocked phones are nice, and offer you the freedom of choice with your service.Hopefully this review is helpful to anyone considering purchasing an unlocked smart phone.Update 4/6/2013 :Check the comments to see how to resolve the ringtone issue.I have also encountered a slight problem with sending MMS messages.  When I attempt to send them I get an error.  Looking at the APN settings, everything is as it should be, so I'm not sure why it's not working.  I've sent photos through different apps with no problem, but attaching them to a MMS, I always get this error.  Maybe it's an issue with AT&T;, but I will update if the problem is resolved.Update 4/7/2013 :MMS error resolved.  I had to download a messaging app from the google play store, but it seems to have fixed the problem.  I am finding out that the built in functions for this phone are not the best.  But fortunately you can download free apps to solve the issues you might run into.  I downloaded Handcent SMS and now I can send my MMS messages without recieving an error.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00B7NAFI6" id="B00B7NAFI6-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-07:</strong> good phone, for child</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00B7NAFI6" id="B00B7NAFI6-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-02:</strong> great team at a great price, including cheap phones is one of the best, pretty hot, but because I gave it a really exaggerated use, but nothing that does not give any other.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00B7NAFI6" id="B00B7NAFI6-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-01:</strong> First of all, this phone is a very good value at about $120. You have a recent version of the Android OS, a wide range of Android applications can be installed, and the screen is responsive without lag.Here are the two shortcomings I noticed, which, if important to you, might be deal-breakers, even at this low price:Poor camera---The captured video is of very poor quality when using any decent settings (i.e. H264 at 720p, or even MPEG4 at 480p). Very blocky, low frame rate; it's as if the processor can't keep up with the data input (Yes, I did try recording direct to internal memory so as to rule out slow SD card: no better). Still pictures are OK, but tend to be rather dark and missing detail at 5 MP AUTO settings. So, you wouldn't buy this phone for more than very casual use as a still camera, and probably only for send-by-message-or-email video. I was also unable to get the flash to work with any camera setting, even under low light.Wifi might be on the weak side---When compared with many other devices, the indicated strength of the wifi connection was low. I did not suffer drop-outs, as far as I could tell (although when listening to streaming data, the buffer may have covered the problem). Often the web browser would seem to pause during display of web pages, so I have a suspicion that a wifi dropout might have been the culprit.If you don't really care about the quality of the camera, and you don't notice any problems with wifi, then this phone is a pretty amazing deal.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00B7NAFI6', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00B7NAFI6', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00GD6H0NU</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00GD6H0NU</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GD6H0NU" id="B00GD6H0NU-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-11:</strong> One short and sweet one liner -> Nexus 5 is literally a big brother of iPhone 5s. Its as beautiful as black iPhone 5S and Kitkat OS is on par (actually better) with iOS. You can say its bigger iPhone (I mean it) because Android OS is more flexible, customizable and powerful and it is bigger than in size like its big brother. The bigger size definitely helps in games and all kind of media consumption.This device performance is buttery smooth and the overall experience inspires utmost satisfaction. Given its size it feels so light and slim even compared to iPhone 5/5s.It is not even best nexus device so far but best out yet among all.And now I will explain it.--------------------------1. Design, look and build quality-> I differ here from most reviewers who says its plain or boring and nothing stands out of this. Its as good looking as black (space gray) iPhone 5S. Its all black like iPhone 5s. Though its made of plastic its feels sturdy, well built with precision only known to Apple. And for the people who tell iPhone made of aluminum, Nexus 5 sides appears no inferior to iPhone 5S black sides. The front glass is very well fused with the body with almost no gaps. Now what we are left with? Back? The back of Nexus 5 is though made of plastic it feels very good in the hand and due to its matte finish does not seem to slip off.Now one step further...iPhone 5S black (or space gray) seems to have identity crisis of being black or something else, Nexus 5 black is perfectly black and it has got radically different sides (not plain round rectangle which all other smartphones have). The sides are beautifully something else.iPhone 5S beauty is revealing and Nexus 5 beauty being black is mysterious and never gets boring.I love this black beauty and don't blame for my taste as they said "beauty lies in the eyes of beholders"."Simplicity is Beauty and Beauty is simplicity, nothing more, nothing less." - Oscar Wilde. If any phone on the market lives up to the Oscar Wilde's quote its Nexus 5.In short its unapologetically simple".2. Processor/speed-> Buttery/silky smooth. Neck to neck with iPhone 5s and second only to Note 3 for all practical purposes.3. Screen/display-> Awesome. Its better than retina any time as its full HD. The feeling of display being washed up goes away very soon and remember the so called best retina have the same problem as they share the same display technology.4. Ecosystem-> Android eco system is as good  as Apple's. In fact I find it better because of Android OS power you have kind of powerful applications which Apple fan boys can never have. Apple fan boys just give a try to 'tasker' (Warning: Only if you can handle Android's raw power.)5. Powerful Soul-> "Fools are those who don't want their souls to be powerful." Its as good as iOS but better why? because its powerful and customizable. You can do the things with it when you need. Its no way comparable to inferior iOS. Apple fan boys! People should not be proud of a system which does not even let them change default for anything.6. Call Quality -> Fantastic. I have never had so clear voice on call for very long.7. Network Signal Quality -> Fantastic.8. Volume/Speaker-> Inherently the speaker is very loud. Though in some application it might sound a little short of enough but its software related problem and should be fixed in future update. I have tested the volume in many application like play and in some apps are freaking load. While playing music through play I had to cut down on the volume in car its so powerful.With headphones its fantastic. The voice quality is very superior and has no noise in it. Its as pure as it gets.9. Camera-> I have seen all the comparisons of Nexus 5 with all leading phones (HTC one, Nokia Lumia, iPhone 5s, Samsung Galaxy S4) and its competing neck to neck in every department except its little slow to focus. But once it focus it takes very good images. HDR+ beats all other phones (I swear it). But again Google admitted it was software related issue and would be fixed soon through update. Personally I am pretty satisfied with the camera.Its at least best nexus phone camera and comparable to others except in little slower to focus. The photos are very detailed with accurate colors.Note: I have uploaded some photos for reference.10. Battery-> No complaints. Nothing great or bad  here. Its definitely better than many old phones (including galaxy nexus) and equal to many others.It just falls short of only two smart phones right now which are LG G2 and Note 3. But it's battery is comparable to the best smartphone i.e. iPhone 5s. So if iPhone 5S can be the best with that kind of battery I don't understand how we could complain of Nexus 5. For casual usage you will charging it once a day. The noticeable thing is that in idle mode it does not eat battery at all and that's where it will average out better end of the day.11. Reparability-> iFixit has given its 8 of 10 in this department and you should feel comfortable saving your money on costly repair by doing many things yourself and the whole assembly is modular.Summary-> Even keeping its lower price aside, Its the one of best smart phone and should equal or better any best smart phone on the planet right now. And you add advantage of lower price...</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GD6H0NU" id="B00GD6H0NU-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-02:</strong> Unfortunately, my Nexus 5 came broken.

I also have an iPad 3 and an iPod Touch 4th generation. I wrote a lengthy Nexus 7 review before; here is my lengthy Nexus 5 review updated after over a month of straight usage. It should cover the vast majority of topics on the device. Let's get started on what possibly is the best high end phone deal in America.(1) Hardware:Personally, in my opinion, high to medium end devices from reputable brands have reached the point where most people won't be able to tell the difference or the difference won't be something they regularly use. That said, I'm still going to cover it, if you're not interested in the nerd talk about hardware, then all you need to know is that the phone is capable hardware wise for demanding users and honestly overkill for average users. Skip this section of my review and head on down to the camera portion.The device is built on a Qualcomm S800 Pro processor. Clocked at 2.2 GHz quadcore processor, the phone screams on speed. I'm not a fan of mobile benchmarks due to their inherent problems of actually measuring what they claim, but benchmarks all put the Nexus 5 at the moment in the top end of performance. Compared to my Nexus 7's Tegra 3, the Nexus 5 has a fighter jet engine compared to the first generation Nexus 7's turboprop engine.There's also a Hynix 2 GB RAM chip running at DDR3 1600 Mhz, and either a 16 GB or 32 GB Sandisk NAND memory chip depending which model you bought. Google is charging $50 more for the 32 GB device. That's about a 625% markup over wholesale NAND prices. Take that as you will.There are Bluetooth, NFC, GPS and unlike the Nexus 4, a slim-port compatibility, thus letting you connect the phone to a monitor or television screen. LG/Google kept the wireless charging from the Nexus 4, to which the wireless charger has to be purchased separately.The phone comes with an Adreno 330 graphics chip. I'm not a big mobile gamer, but this per the professional reviews and FPS benchmarks will handle every game out for Android. For non-gamers, the Adreno 330 is overkill.Microphone and talk clarity are on par with Nexus 4, meaning fine. Speaker seems to have more noise at higher volumes. Also, speaker is mono despite there being two grills at the bottom. One grill is for the microphone.Connects via standard USB, where the device itself has a microUSB connection. Plugging the device into your computer brings it up as another removable storage device where you can simply drop and drag files into folders. Easy file movement plus standard USB makes the device very simple to use and standard charging conventions make it easy to find chargers around your house and office. Sometimes the device goes wonky on USB connection (was a Nexus 4 issue as well), so just go into settings and storage, click on the settings (3 vertical boxes) and change the connection to PTP or MPT and the phone will reappear properly.Like all recent Nexus devices, no MicroSD slot and no removable battery. MicroSD slot is partially alleviated now that USB OTG works. See my "other" section for more details.You can find these specific parts on iFixit's tear down which gave it a solid 8/10 for user repair. For the low price of $349/$399, there is no other phone with this quality hardware that for the price.Right now, due to shortages in supply, many people are scalping the phones for profit. If you can wait, the phone will ship between 2 and 4 weeks and if the Nexus 4 timeline tells us anything, quickly reach the point where it's under a week. My phone took a little under 3 weeks to deliver from ordering it on the 1st of November.(2) Camera:The back camera is still an 8 megapixel and front is 1.3 megapixel, same as the Nexus 4. Low light has improved considerable and HDR+ alleviates many of lighting problems. HDR is a software/hardware combination that takes three photos, one underexposed, one overexposed and one regular and the software combines them to even out the lighting issues to produce the best possible shot. Graininess has been reduced as well. Google keeps the same minimal interface for the camera with the select and drag method for changing options.Image stabilization is so-so and the camera can be slow to focus at times. The Nexus 5 camera is an improvement over the Nexus 4, but a Lumia this is not.  Google released updates to the Android OS that had specific Nexus 5 camera fixes. The camera's improved, but it's still relatively slow at focusing. However, image quality has improved considerably as have night shots. The only real criticism now is that the camera is slow to focus.(3) Android 4.4 - Operating System:Google's latest and greatest is on display here. Android 4.4, otherwise known as Kitkat comes pre-installed on the phone. There are some changes from Android 4.3 Jelly bean. Like all Nexus devices, operating system updates are done over the air via Google. No waiting on device manufacturers or carriers.The launcher has changed and on the Nexus 5 (and it's exclusive to the Nexus 5), and widgets are now removed from the app screen and are accessed by pressing and holding down on a home screen.Icon sizes have been enlarged in the app library, and formatting has been tweaked.Android Run Time (ART) is now available as opposed to the stock Google Dalvik compiler. Allegedly, ART nets a handful more hours out of the device per some reviews, but I haven't noticed any difference. In theory, ART should speed up the device, but with the S800 Pro already blazing fast, it's questionable if anyone will notice, your mileage will vary. Also, some apps are broken under ART.Google has prominently placed Google search on the top of the phone and included the new function of simply talking to your phone to have it fulfill requests. Simply say "Ok Google" and the Google Now function loads up where you can ask questions or request information simply by talking to it. Phone has to be unlocked for it to work as opposed to the Moto X which I believe will work without unlocking.Hangouts has merged with text messaging for a combined app. As with all Android phones, you can download another app and make it your default over Hangouts. Currently the Hangouts change in my opinion was a mistake. Group texting via SMS has problems with sending, the app prioritizes sending to Gmail accounts over SMS and you can't mix SMS and Gmail group chats together. The separation in 4.3 was a better system.Google kept the Sywpe like typing option on its default keyboard (drag your fingers between keys rather than typing) and notification center appears to be the same from 4.3. Colors however for notification went from blue to white. Also the notification flashing light is still there from the Nexus 4. It's sort of like the Blackberry's red flashing LED, but at the bottom.Outside of the changes from 4.3, stock Android 4.3, stock meaning there's no "skin" over it such as Touchwiz or HTC's Sensation, runs extremely fast. Apps load instantly, everything is extremely responsive. This is not Android Honeycomb that was an unresponsive lag filled mess. It is however, less intuitive than iOS 6/7. Android verse Apple has always been like this and its personal preference. That said, if you're in to nearly complete customization, widgets, lock screen information and generally busting out of a walled garden to have your phone do what you want it to do, this is your cup of tea.(4) Battery Life:The battery life on the Nexus 5 is better than the Nexus 4. A slight boost of 200 mAh to 2,300 from 2,100 mAh is minor and it appears the gains are from the operating system primarily. Some user are reporting with ART, they can last a full day as opposed to 16 to 17 hours on Dalvik, some users are reporting the same battery life.After more than a month of the usage on the device, I find that battery life is generally superior to the Nexus 4 and going a whole day is not a problem. This isn't a Note 3 that will last all day gaming. Mileage will vary depending on your behavior.The biggest killer of battery aside from constant gaming is using LTE in an area with weak LTE signal. The phone (like all phones) will eat up huge amounts of battery trying to maintain the bad signal. Sometimes it will drain 20% of my battery in an hour or two on standby. Switching to 3G as the primary network reduces standby usage to a few percent over two or three hours.(5) Build & Looks:The phone comes in two colors, black and white. Note that the white version does not extend the white to the front; it's just the back panel.The phone is fairly light and considerably lighter than the Nexus 4. It is still a black rectangle like most smartphones. LG/Google have forgone the glass backing from the Nexus 4. This should significantly reduce real damage as the soft plastic backing is far less susceptible to shattering like glass. The phone is a bit thinner than the Nexus 4.Screen is 4.95 inches, with confirmed Gorilla Glass 3. The phone is using IPS which gives better clarity and color than the Nexus 4. Resolution is set at 1,920-by-1,080 pixel for a 445 pixel density (PPI). I'd still use a screen guard as the face drop test reveals that Gorilla Glass 3 is good for preventing scratches, but so-so to horrendously bad on impact resistance.Side bezels are very minimal, but the top and bottom bezels are still large. Overall, it's not going to wow people upon first look, but most of us are here for performance and pure Android, what excites us is now how a phone looks, but what we can do with it.(6) LTE & Carrier Support:Google is selling these phones completely unlocked, meaning that you can go to any carrier that supports its bands and it should work.Unlike the Nexus 4, the Nexus 5 is LTE enabled. This was a huge reason for me to get the Nexus 5 as I'm paying for T-Mobile's LTE on the simple plan but I wasn't able to access it. My local HSPA+ was topping out around 11 Mbp/s in the heart of Honolulu to a paltry 4 Mbp/s in my house away from the heart of the city. LTE has pushed urban speed to over 30 Mbp/s (per my last test) and my house to over 9 Mbp/s. Your mileage will of course vary.Nexus 5's LTE will work with bands on T-Mobile, Sprint and AT&T.; Verizon has some LTE bands that the Nexus 5 doesn't support and Verizon and Google have some ideological issues that are preventing them from working together on the Nexus line. T-Mobile is selling the device non-subsidized at a $100 markup financed over 24 months at 0%. Sprint is selling the phone subsidized at $49 but you'll pay it all back and more through subsidy recovery fees built into the monthly bill. AT&T; isn't selling the device but will support BOYD Nexus 5. Be aware though, unless you're on AT&T;'s prepaid Aio service, you're still going to be paying for subsidy recovery fees even though you didn't get a subsidy from AT&T.;A lot of people don't seem to understand that the amount they pay for the phone on day one, usually $199 is not the total price they pay for the phone. That's the down payment. AT&T;/Sprint/Verizon and previously T-Mobile recover their subsidy via the fees they charge in their monthly. T-Mobile and other non-contract carriers have broken out of this model and give a dosage of transparency to monthly billings as to what is service fee and what is subsidy recovery. If you buy an unlocked phone from Google and take it to T-Mobile, you will not be charged a device fee. If you take it to Verizon/AT&T;/Sprint outside of their prepaid options, you will be charged a device fee even though you did not get a subsidy. This will vastly increase the total price you pay for your phone. Keep that in mind.The best deal for this phone if you don't talk much is T-Mobile's $30 a month plan for 100 minutes, unlimited text and 5 GB of LTE, unlimited 3G. Download Google Voice for data calling if you need more talk time. For two years of service, that's $1,069 in total monthly and phone bills. That's less than the cost of 10 months of Verizon.If you're looking at other plans, Apple has done an extremely fantastic job of comparing AT&T;, Sprint, Verizon and T-Mobile's myriad plans into a single nice webpage. Google "iPhone Plans Comparison" for the best simple comparison of American big carrier plans. Apple labels these "iPhone Plans" but they are generic smartphone plans that anyone on any compatible device can purchase.(7) Other:Unlike the Nexus 4, USB Hosting OTG works. I personally don't find this that important, considering that OTG is a hassle on a device that's constantly on the move, but it is a big change from the Nexus 4 which didn't apply sufficient voltage to power USB Hosting. If you're wondering what USB Hosting/OTG is, USB Hosting and "On The Go" lets a phone or tablet to plug in a USB device in and let the device via the right program access the storage on the USB device. I'm currently using the Nexus Media Importer (as I previously bought that for the Nexus 7) as it lets me do this without rooting. I was never a big memory user on my Nexus 4, but I know some people are. Google "Meenova" for a more compact design that will let you access MicroSD cards on your Nexus 5. See my picture in the photo gallery.When I first started the phone up, Google play strangely tried to download and install every app I'd previous bought. What gives? I had to manually stop the install of certain apps.Sound quality via headphones is solid, but depends also on the quality of your headphones/earphones. Sound on the speaker is relatively low.Rooting is available now and there are a few ROMs for the Nexus 5 if you wish to play around.Accessories are flooding Amazon as well as eBay for relatively affordable prices. I'm using the[AIR CUSHION] Spigen Google Nexus 5 Case ULTRA HYBRID [Black] [1 FREE Premium Japanese Screen Protector + 2 FREE Graphics] Anti-Scratch Bumper Case with Clear Back Panel for Nexus 5 - ECO-Friendly Package - Black (SGP10609), but I'm not entirely happy as the flush buttons make it hard to use one handed as opposed to myRINGKE FUSION for Google Nexus 4 Best Selling Shock Absorption Bumper + Anti Scratch Clear Back Premium Hybrid Case [Eco/DIY Pkg.][BLACK].Personally, I do love Android. I can simply turn my phone on, look at my lock screen at the Dashclock Widget and see how many texts I have, emails, weather notifications Facebook notifications and so on without having to unlock my phone. I can also turn on GPS, silence my phone, the flash light on and other functions from my lock screen too. The Nexus 5 gives me a great affordable option.(8) Conclusion:The Nexus 5 has some drawbacks, adequate camera, no MicroSD slot, no removable battery and lacking some of Verizon's LTE bands. It does provide a blazing fast processor, roaring graphics chip, an extremely stock version of Android, thin and light design for a very affordable unlocked price. And it's Sprint capable. Android does take some time to learn, but it offers nearly complete customization. For $349 and a dose of willingness to learn, you can't go wrong here.TLDR: Blazing fast smartphone, okay camera, no bloatware, no Verizon, unlocked and just $349~399.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GD6H0NU" id="B00GD6H0NU-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-08:</strong> I used the iPhone 4 and moved to the Nexus 5 for my first Android phone.

The speaker is probably the worst part of the phone. Even when you use headphones, it's too quiet. I actually use my Moto G when I want to listen music so that's a real turn off.2. The battery life - I have watched reviews that suggests the battery life will get better with time. I've only had this phone for about a week but it has never gotten me through a full day. It maxes out at about 7 hours so I always have to take my charger. I won't consider myself a heavy user. I use my phone to do mainly chatting, your typical social media stuff, news, internet browsing etc. I don't do gaming or movie watching - so considering that I really expected a full day. I'm still waiting to see if it gets better with time.3. The camera - is a weak point on this phone. It carries a 1.3MP front camera - which is really as bad as it gets on a high end smart phone. This camera is really ok for skype etc... won't give you any good photos at all. The back camera is a 8MP, I will say this camera exceeded my expectations because I've heard so many bad things about it I guess I bought it expecting the worst. I'm yet to take any photos with HDR+ enabled and the quality of the photos are satisfactory. With phones around with 13, 26, 20 and even higher MP, if you're really into photo and video taking, I won't recommend this phone. You're never going to impress anybody with any photo that comes from this phone - never mind it was marketed for these purposes.I will add that there is a new google camera app that was launched last week that makes the experience a better one and includes the lens blur feature of the HTC one (M8) but it reduces the quality of the photo in this mode. As google continues to update the camera app I imagine the experience in this department will only get better.4. Design - I don't mind the simplicity of it but I will admit the iphone 5s and the HTC one (M8) are incredibly sexier and more pleasing to the eyes. So too but less so is the Sony Z2. Phones like the Moto X and the HTC one (M8) are invariably gonna feel better in your hand as well.5. The display. I wasn't sure what people meant by the display being 'washed out'. I found out when I bought this phone. Holding it up beside the Moto G, the display on the Moto G (which is quite incredible I must say) looked better. Something is off with the colours but I find when the brightness is turned all the way up it looks better. Why does the colours change with dimming the display - I'm not sure. Apart from that though, the display is boss.I have not experienced any connectivity problems with this phone.What I love:1. The price. I can't afford an iphone 5s (won't buy one even if I could), the s5, the Z2 or the M8. This phone is always compared to these phones despite the huge price difference. The fact of comparison alone says a lot regardless of the verdict.2. Software - 4.4.2 - I love having the latest and greatest OS and being first in line for every update. Google Now is deeply integrated and there is zero bloatware. These are three things that are highly important to me. At the end of the day, software is what you're going to be interacting with each time you turn on or unblock your phone so I can't think of anything that could be more important.3. Performance. The OS makes specs less important than they use to be because it requires less. For that reason, the Nexus 5 performs just as good and even better than other flagship devices. It can handle any app you throw at it and after one week the phone has not stopped to take a breather. There are other phones that have better specs and it doesn't make them better - they require more to handle the bloatware that bugs down the device. Don't be fooled in this regard - the Nexus 5 has everything under the hood you could ever need.Keep in mind this phone does not allow storage extension.I still give this phone 5 stars because it is obviously intended to target a specific set of people - people like me who place software at the top of the list of priorities alongside price. There really isn't a better phone you'd get at this price.There is no such thing as 'the best phone' - phones are different just as people are different and they are made to meet different needs. You have to know what you want out of your device and I found what I needed out of the Nexus 5. If the strengths of the phone are not important to you and the weaknesses are I could easily recommend a different phone.I'd surely recommend this phone to those whose attention its trying to get - it is a deal you should not miss.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GD6H0NU" id="B00GD6H0NU-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-31:</strong> Have used it for over a month now.

It comes with the latest version of pure android and should always get future upgrades first and has very good hardware specs.  It's kind of like a Galaxy S4 done right.  It doesn't come with all the really bad software Samsung, Carriers and others put on top of android. It is very fast and android 4.4 kitkat adds some nice updates.  The phone itself is rather plain looking, feels great in the hand and has a very nice display.  The ceramic buttons feel premium over the other phones i used.  I think the standout on this device is the specs and the software, which are top notch.  The display, camera and battery life are very good while not being the best on any phone. Everything else about this phone and this phone as a whole package seems to be the best.  I am very happy with it.  I've used the note 2, galaxy s4, nexus 4, iphone 5s and moto x for extended amounts of time.  The only other phone in the group I would consider is the moto x, if u have a preference for something smaller.  But compared to the rest I've used the Nexus 5 is the better choice.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GD6H0NU" id="B00GD6H0NU-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-22:</strong> The last three phones I've had have been Nexus.  Previously, I used the iPhone 3G.  I am giving the Nexus 5 four stars instead of 5 because I have yet to find a perfect phone.I define a perfect phone by providing responsiveness, excellent battery life, and an optimal user experience (vast array of applications, features, and feel).The Nexus is the best job Google has ever done to provide me with everything I want.  However, there are shortcomings.  I'll address the benefits first, and the negatives second.Why you need the Nexus 5:1.  This phone is widely available off contract for $399.  The price here is a little higher, but with Prime, you know what you are getting.  That's roughly half of the off-contract price for a new iPhone.2.  If you are operating on an unlimited T-Mobile plan as I am, in Seattle, this sucker is FAST.  Regularly receive over 25Mbps download, over 6Mbps upload.  Fast enough to watch baseball games in real time.3. No bloatware.  I made the switch from Verizon to T-Mobile after my Galaxy Nexus took forever to get updates.  Don't have to worry about that anymore.  If you want the most recent software on your Android Device, purchase a Nexus of a Google Play Edition phone.  done.4. Feel.  The phone feels great in my hand.  They improved the design greatly over the Nexus 4; the back is an almost rubberized plastic, where the 4 was easily shattered glass.  Where the look of the 4 may have been prettier, it feels as if LG/Google wanted to design this thing to be a workhorse.5.  Wireless charging.  Continuing with the 4's charging legacy, all my Qi-chargers work with this.  Note: you don't have to purchase the super-expensive wireless charger from Google.  It looks pretty, but it's price is astronomical.6.  Apps.  Between the Amazon App Store and Google Play store, I find 99.9% of what I want.  I love Amazon MP3 on here.  No DRM, quick downloads.  Seamless.Now...for the bad:1.  Amazon Instant Video - it's a no show. Can't get it native (read: the app) on any Android phone.2.  Camera.  The inclusion of HDR made the Nexus camera better, but it still feels like an also-ran.  If you're connected to Instagram or any other selfie-driven service, an iPhone will probably suit you better.  I take pictures with a nice DSLR.  This camera is used to snap a photo of where I parked :).  YMMV.3.  No Verizon.  Until Verizon lets this phone on their network, it will never get 5 stars.  Verizon would have to agree not to modify the software...and I don't see that happening.4.  Battery.  Still better than its predecessors, I think having a phone with extraordinary battery life (think old BlackBerries) would be a killer Nexus feature.  I get a full day, but want more.In summation, if you are on ATT, Sprint, or T-Mobile, and you want a workhorse off-contract device, you've met your new best friend.  You won't be let down.  However, if you want Amazon Instant Video, go get an iPhone.  You won't find it here.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GD6H0NU" id="B00GD6H0NU-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-15:</strong> EDITED REVIEW:There are two versions of the phone, new has bigger speaker vents and newer, more shatter-resistant glass. Look at the web as to how to distinguish the two. Google store was dumping the old inventory at the time I bought it, and I have the older version, even though the new one was available for over a month. There was no indication whether the "new" or "old" phone would ship.I doubt that this is a big deal in the overall long-term function of this device, but it would be good to be able to buy the "new" version if given the choice.Some problems that have surfaced:-the phone has a habit of sometimes forgetting it's hooked up to a BT device.-phone doesn't always like to connect to WiFi without a restartFor this I'm deducting a star.Original review below:Bought this on the google play store. $400+ tax and shipping. Had it on my doorstep the next day.Came from s3, and didn't want to renew my contract with SprintPros:-beautiful screen-almost no pre-installed software-fast processors-excellent microphone, most people I call say they can hear me much more clearly-seems to have a better antenna than the s3, have been getting better reception-long battery life-cheap (nearest competitors are 200-250 more)Cons:-google INSISTS on shipping phone with "hangouts" which is  a clunky SMS program--forcing you to either endure it or downloading an ad-infested 3rd party SMS app-doesn't seem to like any USB cable except the one that shipped with the phone-charging seems to take a while-screen is a bit dim, even when set to manual and the highest setting--a problem when outdoors in bright sun. If it's on auto, it's really hard to read. I use my phone to track biking and running, and can't always see the screen.This is too good for 4 stars and not perfect for 5, but there's no 4.5.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GD6H0NU" id="B00GD6H0NU-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-23:</strong> Perfect product, works very well.

The delightful, but underrated and underpowered, Palm Pre, several Samsung Galaxy phones, most recently the Galaxy Nexus.The Nexus 5 blows them all away.  It is blindingly fast.  There something between little and no lag when you tap on an icon until the app launches.  Is this due to the hardware or KitKat?  I don't know, but I also don't really care.The battery life, and power management, are better than the previous phones.  One of my ongoing issues with the Samsung phones is that while I was driving with my phone plugged into a charger when I using the GPS, playing an audio file to my radio, and having my Bluetooth headset active, the battery drained.  I'd lose 30% of my charge in an hour drive.  And the battery would overheat, with the whole phone becoming uncomfortably hot.With the Nexus 5, I do all that stuff and the battery gains charge!  I've gotten into the car with the phone at less than 80% charge and gotten to work with the battery fully charged and the phone wasn't hot to the touch.The camera is great and the screen is amazing.Are other phones better?  Maybe.  And surely something better will be along in six months.  But for now, I'm a very happy camper.A quick note - the phone is available at the Google Play Store for $349 for a 16gb version and $399 for a 32gb version.  Mine was in my hands 4 days after I ordered it, well before Google promised to ship it.  As long as the phone is available from Google at a better price, why pay these inflated prices?</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GD6H0NU" id="B00GD6H0NU-review19" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-10:</strong> The Nexus 5 is the best Nexus yet and one of the best phones at that.  I've had mine for approximately a week and couldn't be happier.  I got the white one and think it looks fantastic.  With that note, let's get into a review and we'll start on build quality:The build - the phone is solidly built and light too - I personally like a heaver phone being a man with larger hands.  So, if you like lighter phones and find others too bulky, this may be refreshing for you.  Some professional reviews state the phone is good or mediocre build at best which is patently false.  Yes, there's a seam on this phone, especially owning a white version but it isn't some huge gap that's ugly or a place where you can push the two pieces together more.  The phone has no creaks at all and the glass is flush on all sides.  I mention the glass because I've owned Motorola, HTC, and even iPhones where the glass at the edge isn't even across the whole device and it drives me nuts.  The new buttons are ceramic - ohhh!  They are nice and work well.  The sim card tray is next to the power button but I haven't noticed it at all searching for the button as it's very flush with the phone. There isn't an SD card slot on this phone - get over it.  32GB is enough for MOST users.  If you are truly a power user who needs to swap out 64GB cards frequently for whatever reasons (I know some of you do exist) this isn't the phone for you.  I'm sorry, the Nexus devices haven't had one in a long time and it's a cost saving measure too.Next is connectivity and calling - the main point of a phone, right?  I won't discuss specific networks as that opens up a whole different debate that entire forums can't solve!  LTE works screaming fast on the phone and it holds onto the signal well.  HSPA+ is a beast on this phone too if your area doesn't have it.  Calls connect well and nothing has dropped so far.  The call quality is decent, which is a bummer as I'm one who still talks a lot on their phone.  I haven't tried any HD voice features yet so that may help the issue.  Wifi works well on the phone too both with 5ghz and 2.4ghz - my older router doesn't have all the latest standards but the phone supports any wifi you'll encounter.  I'll point out that my house is an old one with huge blocks that love to cancel out any cell signals.  This phone holds onto them and keeps them unlike other phones I've used on the same network.Screen - The best I've used.  I have grown tired of the Samsung AMOLED screens and favor the route Apple and HTC and now LG have taken, for the most part.  It's super crystal clear and even being a near-sighted blind person, I can't pick out pixels for the first time.  Colors are pretty accurate and everything is great looking.  The touch portion of the screen is great too with no issues.  It works as well as any other top tier phone.  Now 'for the most part' means I do notice this screen, as any LCD, cannot do true black unlike AMOLED.  It's a feature left to that technology alone but it doesn't detract here as the screen is great and you don't notice unless you have a competing phone next to it.Battery - It's average on this phone.  It isn't a beast like I've had on some Moto phones but it isn't a junker like some Samsung devices I've used too.  After the first couple days, it evened out and with moderate use I can make it to 10pm bed-time.  It isn't going to blow you away but it isn't the worst out there either.  I'd have liked an option to use a removable battery as I don't mind a heavier device or battery - but clearly we are going to wafer light and thin devices.Camera - It's a good camera to me and leaps and bounds better than any past phone I've owned including other Nexus devices.  Pictures come out clear and the HDR+ feature is pretty good as well.  Pictures come out sharper and it even works well trying to take a picture of my moving baby.  I can still tell it was taken with a phone vs. a stand-alone camera, but it's way more sufficient for my wants than I need.  The wife takes the serious pictures, I just take pictures of things to make sure I bought the right item.  So, if you aren't a budding photographer, this thing works well and even captures moving people well enough.Software - The new KitKat 4.4 is here and overall I love it more than the last version, just like I do with every android release.  I won't give a comprehensive review of the OS here, but I'll touch on some things.  Google added some developer options on this phone that you can enable as an option that make it scream.  It moves faster than I can use it now and this is a great step for any phone OS.  I've used Windows Phone 8 and many flavors of iOS and many versions of Android.  This is by far my favorite OS now, hands down.  MS has done well with 8, but this blows that out of the water now.  iOS 7 has veered off to me and I personally don't like it.  Anyway, this thing is fast!  Google now is better than ever, but I had to turn it off as it sucked battery down.  I hope Google addresses this as the service is awesome.  Hangouts is cool that everything is in one spot, but it's clunky to use for SMS and everything.  I wish google would have waited until everything in hangouts was totally done before merging, but they at least give you the option to download another SMS program and set it as the default now.  You have got to love choices.  Default email is better now and Gmail and calendar are excellent as ever.  Overall it's a pleasant step forward and hardly anything I don't like.That's a basic review of the phone and I'll end with the overall value and point of the phone.  Here on this great online retailer, the phone appears to cost more.  You can easily go to the source, if available in your country, and purchase it for an incredibly great price.  It is completely unlocked so you don't have to fiddle with buying an unlock code, which in the USA is now shady anyway, and waste more time and money.  This phone also will get updates quickly without hassles or being left in the dust instantly.  It's also priced at a mid-tier value, for almost all top tier specs and experiences.  I think many pro-reviewers have worried that things like the camera or battery aren't toe to toe with other phones, but those do cost more.  The bigger issue they miss is Android on this phone is unlike it on any other phone.  That's worth something too and what I stress is the most important thing about this phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GD6H0NU" id="B00GD6H0NU-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-22:</strong> great phone, everything you can expect from a nexus phone.

I called Google support and they don't know how to change the ring tone. When they had to escalate to a supervisor to tell me how to change a message ring tone I had it.

I needed another smartphone, but didn't want to purchase the iPhone 5s instead waiting for the launch of the iphone 6 this fall. As an interim, I researched and decided on this Nexus 5. Also because my youngest son,who is in college talked about an unlocked Google Nexus smartphone as his next best choice; whoch I will pass this Nexus 5 to him, once the iphone 6 is available to purchase. I also decided on this Google product, because of the lack of any LG overlays, so much cleaner usage. I also do very much like the swipe typing feature, which the IOS software does not have.  I do not like the small earpiece that went into LG's design of this phone, as I always have to adjust the position of my ear to hear a caller. I like the &#34;no physical Home button&#34; on the face of this phone, bc the phone has a fluid look on the front.  I'm still learning how to use this new Nexus 5 phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GD6H0NU" id="B00GD6H0NU-review26" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-30:</strong> I purchased this phone directly from Google when it first came out and have absolutely loved it. It worked very well the first few months I owned it. Unfortunately, two flaws have emerged that completely disable the phone, and one cannot be fixed.First issue was that the upgrade to Android version 4.4.2 introduced an error for certain popular applications that use the camera, such as Skype, causing the phone to heat up and the battery to drain in about an hour. Look up "mm-qcamera-daemon"; that's the name of the application that will run constantly, even when you aren't using any camera-related apps or even using the phone at all, and that will completely deplete the battery within two hours. The solution is to uninstall these apps, which is inconvenient and reduces the functionality of the phone. Google's evidently known about this problem since the introduction of the latest version of Android and has yet to fix it.The second issue, the fatal one, is the "SIM Card Added - please reboot" message. Although it may not affect all that many phones, you will find thousands of posts on this problem. Moreover, at least based on my experience, is that you never know when this problem will rear its ugly head. No one seems to know the source of this problem, whether it's hardware, software, or network related. My guess is it's some unique combination of all three, but the fact of the matter is that it seems to affect primarily the Nexus 5 and not other devices and will render your phone completely unusable. My phone worked nearly perfectly from when I received it in November, 2013 until late April, 2014. Then I took it with me to a new city and as soon as I got off the plane and turned it on, I got this message, and the phone would not connect to the network until I rebooted. Everything was fine after that--for about maybe 5 minutes, or sometime 70 minutes or sometimes 10 minutes, then the message would appear again and the phone would require another reboot to connect to the network again. It doesn't matter if I'm using it or if it's just sitting on a table. Unfortunately, the problem has persisted even after returning home.I've contacted Google twice about the second problem, once by phone and once by chat. They said I had to go through a series of trouble-shooting steps (all of which I tried, by the way, including testing a different SIM) that they promised to email to me and that are required to be performed before sending out a replacement under warranty. Guess what, I never received the email and, so far, after two attempts, there is no way to get Google to honor the warranty.If you want this phone, my advice is to purchase it from a place where the warranty will be honored, because Google has not been responsive to my warranty claim. Of course, that's if you're willing to take the risk of having a phone that for unknown reasons can suddenly become completely unusable as a phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GD6H0NU" id="B00GD6H0NU-review27" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-11:</strong> Recommended. Pay attention to the battery life, specially on bad network coverage. The screen also consumes too much energy. So, I recommend reduce the bright to 50%, which is enough. I would appreciate if it have better view against the sun. Beyond that, the device is pretty fast.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GD6H0NU" id="B00GD6H0NU-review28" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-13:</strong> I love my Google Nexus 5 for two reasons:1) The screen is big and beautiful and compares nicely with phones that cost a lot more like the Samsung Galaxy S4 or the HTC One (which I previously owned).2) As a Nexus device, it automatically updates to the newest version of Android, so that you get the latest and greatest software features from Google first.Some of the advantages of having a phone with the Stock version of Android include no carrier or manufacturer bloatware, which means no spammy apps that try to you to purchase things you don't need like ringtones or service upgrades. It also frees up space so you can store more things like images and video, and system memory so your programs run a little faster. It also gives you a single set of apps that work together flawlessly. Dialer, Hangouts (SMS and instant messaging), and People (contacts) work the way they should without the need to get replacement apps for core features to use your phone.Ergonomically, this phone feels great. The soft-touch rubberized backing keeps the phone from slipping out of your grip. A ceramic volume rocker and power button, while not as substantial as the metal-clad iPhone 5s, give the phone a light-weight and solid feel.One of my concerns with the phone is the rubberized backing. In the past, I've had cases with a similar coat of soft-touch material that has rubbed off over time. And while it hasn't happened yet, it may happen eventually. And while the camera and speaker are adequate, they're definitely not industry-leading. Even though the most recent Android update addressed some camera issues, the camera still has some difficulty focusing when you want to take pictures. So while it might work well for a few Instagram pics, it won't replace your point and shoot. The speaker, on the other hand, does get loud enough, but with the quality of a cheap AM radio. Fortunately, sound from the headphone jack is just fine.Overall, if you're looking for a slick device with a gorgeous screen and a slick interface, you can't go wrong with the Nexus 5. While it may have the luxurious finish or take gorgeous pictures like an iPhone, or play music out of front-facing stereo speakers like the HTC One, it nails its core features, like messaging, taking calls, and running apps on a beautiful HD display. What's more, the fact that you can pick it up off-contract on the Google Play store is a nice bonus.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GD6H0NU" id="B00GD6H0NU-review29" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-09:</strong> The best phone to live the Android experience.

The only thing i dont like about this phone is the battery life, sometimes you get 12-15 hours depending on the use. I charge it using an ipad 4 AC adapter, and for what I've seen, the battery last longer using that rather than the stock that phone comes with. This phone is a beast when it comes to Speed, A  B E A S T. If you like a phone without launchers and you want to get the latest updates on Android OS First, this is the phone to go with.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00GD6H0NU', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00GD6H0NU', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B009LXYB3Y</h2>    <p class="price"> $B009LXYB3Y</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009LXYB3Y" id="B009LXYB3Y-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-18:</strong> I love it!

For the price it is well made and does what is says it does. The lenses are of okay quality and once you figure out the way to make it work with your phone, it is kind of cool. You definitely will need to use the tripod because it is very hard to keep steady and focus in your hand.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009UQWC74" id="B009UQWC74-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-21:</strong> It works great,every concert or sporting event i attend it goes with me.I even use it at home,i live on the 28th floor.I get great shots from my balcony.People admire it everytime i use it.Im so happy i have this product.It works great at the Yankee games.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009UQWC74" id="B009UQWC74-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-27:</strong> There are some out there at 1/2 the price but all plastic.  This machined, aluminum unit is worth the extra price you pay for what you get. It seems solid, has smooth rotation, and appears it will hold up like a normal camera lens.  Phone easily snaps into the rubberized case (for the Samsung S3) and so allows you to leave the lens connected to the case.  The lens screws into a supplied plastic phone cover that snaps onto your existing phone.  That is, if not in any other case already.  Seems the lens can easily break off though the plastic case it screws into. (Hint: where can one order spare case covers?)  Well packaged for shipping and retail sale from the manufacturer.  In a tight plastic bag, in a heavy duty, printed box, with foam padding and bags inside.  But arrived on a 40deg F day and lens was soaking wet inside. Easily cleaned off but suspect lens was packaged in a humid, warm climate.  No dessicant.  Will have to see if lens is still clear in a year.  Having been a photographer in the Amazon, put the lens in a dry box for now :)  The manufacturer name and country of origin is missing on all packaging and documentation.  Glass lens seems reasonable but not great.  Would easily pay twice the price for better, coated optics.  Could not compare to Nikor or similar lens at this time.  Uploaded some photos taken with and without the lens for comparison (see listing).  Still better to use this lens than taking a photo and digitally cropping / zooming in later (or digitally zooming at the time of photo).  The fixed 12x optical zoom is worth it.  You do have to get used to manually focusing again but easy to do with lit subject using the phone LCD.  (no: the camera autofocus will not make up for the optical lens being mechanically out of focus.)  The supplied tripod is a big plus.  Smart to mount the lens and not the camera; like done for large telephotos on DSLR's. The lens is heavy enough compared to the camera to allow balance when mounted this way.  The standard screw mount on the lens ring makes using the GorillaPod tripod with quick snap mounts feasible as well.  This tripod with extendable legs is sturdy aluminum.  Their tripod works great as a hand-held monopod as well.  Overall, an excellent value and use.edit: Am noticing curvature and a black shadow on edges of photos.  Shadow possibly caused by some mirrors internal to the lense (why there?).  See photos uploaded.  Downgrade to 3 stars for this reason.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B009UQWC74', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B009UQWC74', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B007KZQNOA</h2>    <p class="price"> $B007KZQNOA</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007KZQNOA" id="B007KZQNOA-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-27:</strong> Bought this for my cousin when he got a RAZR MAXX and he loves it.

Solid built, fits like a glove and doesn't add too much bulk.The only negative I have about this case is I find the power and volume controls hard to press with my thumb when holding the phone.

That is why it doesn't show this review as an Amazon verified purchase. I thought it would be best to post my review here as well since this is the exact same case that came in my combo purchase.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~My husband and I both have a Droid Razr Maxx. His was purchased October 2, 2012 and mine was purchased March 21, 2013.We originally purchased twoOtterbox Commuter Case for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX - Retail Packaging - Blackas I had an Otterbox on my previous phone (a Droid Incredible 2) and loved it. The silicone flaps covering the access ports on the Otterbox Razr Maxx cases were nothing short of a disappointment. They never seated correctly and were always coming loose and flapping around allowing dust and particles into the ports. One of the reasons for purchasing the Otterbox cases was because it had these port covers. Since those failed to perform correctly these cases were removed from our phones and they have been naked and without protection for about a week now.After extensive research of countless cases and reviews here on Amazon, I purchased this case along with three others in a desperate attempt to find the right case for our Droid Razr Maxx phones, once and for all. The cases purchased and compared were:Asmyna MOTXT912MHPCSO006NP Premium Durable Protective Case for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX XT912 - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - BlackTrident Case AG-XT912-BK AEGIS Case for Motorola Droid Razr MAXX (XT912) - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - BlackSeidio BD2-HR3MTRM-BK SURFACE Case and Holster Combo for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX - Retail Packaging - BlackSeidio BD2-HK3MTRMK-BK ACTIVE Combo with Metal Kickstand for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX - Retail Packaging - Black~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~First, the Asmyna:Pros:-It is easy to 'install'.-The front and back pieces audibly snap together and seems to hold firm.-It feels good in the hand, being somewhat slick and glossy.-Does not add bulk to an already sizable phone.Cons:-It does not line up properly with the camera, flash, speaker or noise-cancelling speaker on the back of the phone.-It is too slick, causing it to slide off of just about any surface.-It is extremely prone to fingerprints.-All ports are openly exposed to the elements (dust and particle collection, moisture, etc.)Bottom line:I would not recommend this case as, for me, its cons outweigh its pros. I also cannot attest to this product's ability to protect a phone from a drop as I did not feel confident that it would stay on the phone upon any kind of impact. So I chose not to submit my $600 phone to what I deemed an imminent death. This case will be returned.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Next, the Trident Aegis:Pros:-Sturdy, two part design.-Everything lined up beautifully on my Razr Maxx.-Install was a breeze, with only a little encouraging to get the inner silicone liner to set inside the lip of the outer hard shell casing.-The outer hard shell has two built-in mesh-like dust covers that go over the rear speaker and the noise-cancelling speaker when installed on the phone.-The design on the back of the inside silicone liner pokes through the back of the outer hard shell and slightly raises the phone off any surface it is laying on, thus making the speaker sound un-muffled. This is a difficult feature to find in cases these days (why manufacturers don't just place the speaker on the front of the phone for this very reason, is beyond me).-All ports are covered by silicone flaps.-Accessibility to the MicroSD and Sim cards without case removal.-Power and volume buttons are covered and operate as if there was no case on the phone.-When laying face down, the outer rim of the case provides protection to the touch screen by slightly raising it off of any surface it is placed on.-Adds bulk, but not as much as the Otterbox Commuter case.Cons:-There are two locations (along the edge of the MicroSD and Sim card protection flap and along the front, top, center of the phone - directly above 'Motorola') on the silicone liner where the silicone is in extremely thin strips. I do not see these holding up very long as I can see these ripping or tearing after sufficient use.-The protective flaps are flimsy and do not set into place very well (with the exception of the headphone jack cover, which seats almost too well).Bottom line:Even though I have listed more pros than cons, I will not be keeping this case. To me, a cell phone case should be something that you can easily install (and remove if necessary) and not be something that you have to continuously battle to stay in place on your phone. Although it is not a deal breaker for me if a phone has protective flaps over access ports or not - it does matter to me that if a case does have these that they set in place properly and not flap around freely. I also am fearful of the longevity of this case given the thinness of the inner silicone liner. For these reasons, I believe I will be returning this Trident Aegis case.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Next, the Seidio Surface (Case and Holster Combo):Pros:-Lined up well with the camera, flash, speaker, noise-cancelling speaker and all buttons.-Does not add any noticeable bulk.-Exterior surface is has a soft-to-the-touch feeling while remaining hard.-Includes a holster.-MicroSD/Sim card access door area of the case is solid. (This may be a con to others, but I prefer this be solid as I rarely ever need to access my SD or Sim cards.)Cons:-No silicone components making it very slick.-Easy to put on the phone, but be prepared for an all out battle to remove it. I spent close to fifteen minutes fighting this thing, trying to coerce it off of my phone. Due to its lack of any silicone, I could not get a good grip on the case and had to turn my phone off as I kept pressing the power and volume buttons in my all out brawl.-All ports are exposed (except the MicroSD and Sim card access door, see Pros list above).Bottom line:This case is laughable. It is the only case in my many years of cell phone ownership to cause me so much frustration upon trying to remove it from my phone. The scenario I found myself in while trying to remove the case was very similar to trying to get out of a Chinese finger trap - pretty much every movement makes things worse. I prefer a case to fit snugly, as those offer the best protection because they will not slip or slide on the phone. But this Seidio Surface case, wow.. needless to say, despite the pros I listed for it, this case will be returned.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~And, finally, the Seidio Active (Case and Holster Combo):Pros:-Does not add much bulk (as compared to the Otterbox Commuter)-Well thought out and functional two part design-Feels good in the hand-Easy to operate while holding in one hand (not too heavy)-Silicone along the edges makes is very easy to grip and keep your grip. This case will rarely slip from your grasp.-All ports and the camera, speaker, noise-cancelling speaker and buttons line up perfectly.-Power and volume buttons respond with the same (if not better!) sensitivity as if there was no case on the phone.-The MicroSD and Sim card access door is completely blocked (again, I know some others may prefer to have access to this door, but this is a preference of mine as I hardly ever need to remove/replace these cards).-The kickstand is a fun addition - is functional and seems as though it would last quite awhile as long as you were gentle when pulling it from its seated magnetic position.-Includes a belt holster which fits the phone w/case perfectly.-The phone w/case can be seated in the included holster either facing in or out.Cons:-The addition of the kickstand on the back causes the phone to tilt toward the top - this muffles the rear speaker.-With so much silicone exposed on the sides of the phone, I can see the potential for these areas being dust magnets.-The top ports (HDMI, Power and headphone jack) are left openly exposed. Although this is not a deal breaker for me, it may be for others. (NOTE: Because the phone can be inserted into the holster either faced in or out, the holster's clip partially covers the top ports, offering some protection. Not much, but thought I would mention it.)-The retention clip on the holster appears to have a disadvantage because of its design - due to the curve and the distance the clip extends from the phone, I can see this potentially catching on things (seat belts, couches, chairs, etc.) and either breaking the clip entirely, rendering the holster useless and requiring a replacement be purchased OR dislodging the phone from the holster allowing it to fall to the ground.Bottom line:I believe I finally found the case I have been searching for - the Seidio Active. My husband also chose this case of the four we received and I have reviewed here. So, I guess that means I need to purchase another one for myself. The black is exactly what my husband wanted, but I prefer a color that stands out more.. so I suppose I will be buying the red or blue. Once I receive that case, I will update my review to report on the clarity of the color as opposed to the color depicted here online.Thank you for reading. I hope my search helps someone else find the perfect case for them too (as well as saving them the time of conducting the research!).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007KZQNOA" id="B007KZQNOA-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-28:</strong> I switched from one phone to a new one and bought this one to protect it and it worked really great.

The screen is so amazing that it honestly hurt my eyes a little for the first hour or so (in the same way that a new glasses prescription hurts - your brain is getting so much more visual information than it's used to, so it needs a minute to adjust). As a teacher, one of my favorite features is S-Beam. S-Beam allows you to send a file to another Samsung phone, just by tapping the two phones back-to-back. When I need to give each of my students a copy of a handout, I no longer need to print one for each student. I print copies for those without Samsungs, but for those students who have Samsungs, I just walk around the room and &#34;bump&#34; the file to each of them.In case anyone reading this has read that sometimes when you order a phone online, what arrives is a knockoff, I will say that when I got my phone, I checked all of the tell tale signs for knockoff S4's and the phone I received is definitely authentic.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CIF9MJK" id="B00CIF9MJK-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-03:</strong> Got it on time  and of course LOOOVE the the phone itself , Works just perfect and i hope there will be no issues with it .

Here's what I like about the phone:Beautiful screen - for those of us who don't have perfect vision, this screen is very readable. The fonts are an appropriate size, with good contrast.Nice speed. The screen is responsive, and allows multiple windows to be open at once.Screen size:  For certain apps, I.e. the kindle app, this screen approximates an e-reader very well (as opposed to reading on a smaller phone screen.)The interface is very thoughtfully designed.  Great job, Samsung!  Unobtrusive, noninvasive methods of accessing critical apps are available from almost anyplace on the phone.Icons/graphics are adorable, and creatively designed.  No boring manila folders on this phone!  Your folders show contents from the outside of the folder... Cute.Ease of use:  There is a little bit of a learning curve on this phone (I had the Samsung Epic previously), but I've pretty much figured it out in a few hours.  It's going to be great. Once you get the hang of the graphics, it's really quick to move things around, personalize, etc.It really blurs the boundary between a tablet and a phone, without becoming too huge, like the Note (which I am now glad I did not buy).Voice quality: I'd read reviews in the last few days that state that it is not very good... I think it's fine. The sound is clear, and volume is fine.One of my favorite apps for Android:  Out of Milk.  Running out of groceries?  Scan the bar code into one of your shopping lists, (or input by voice or typing), and your shopping list is complete.  I keep a running shopping list for Trader Joes, and my other local market.  When I go to the store, I simply move the items I need to the top of the list, and go for it!  No more paper lists!One heads up: (carrier, not phone related):  check on Visual Voicemail.... I use it all the time, and really like it.  I was surprised to discover that I had to pay for it as an add on with Verizon.... It was part of my Sprint service previously.** UPDATE **I've had the phone for almost a week, and it's simply a PLEASURE to use!  Lots of nice touches:  pop up asking if you'd like to add someone to your contacts after a call from a non contact, for example.Camera:  is great.  I photographed an entire exhibit in a museum.... No flash, in dark rooms, and the photos are stunning.Battery life:  surprisingly good!  I used the phone all day yesterday, on and off trains where it would have been seeking service in tunnels (usually drains battery quicker), used my Kindle app, made calls, sent texts and emails, and I still had 60% at the end of a ten hour day.Battery recharging:  using the charging cord that comes with the phone, it charges in no time... A couple of hours at most.  I've been amazed at the recharge speed, compared to my previous phone.Kindle app is like a baby Kindle... there's just enough on the page to not feel like you are only reading a few sentences at a time like on some smaller devices.I'm so pleased with my choice,  I hope you enjoy it, also.(And in case this is helpful to anyone:  if you are debating about a case, I have the Seidio holster case... Please see my review.)*************Enjoy this great device!  Questions?  Drop a note, and I'll get back to you.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CIF9MJK" id="B00CIF9MJK-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-22:</strong> My daughter loved her Christmas present this year.

First there is a flaw in its design, There is a thin plastic strip near bottom of case in front interferes with fingerprint sensor and makes it hard to open charger port. They would have been better to eliminate this piece creating a horse-shoe type cut out for the charger port area.It is designed as CRYSTAL CLEAR... The case has an Amber tint, especially when viewing from the sides, so it is not really crystal clear. The volume and power ports are also encased in plastic with "bumps" to push through the plastic and they are not as responsive as the original buttons.The case also adds quite a noticeable amount of weight and bulk to the phone and the plastic back is extremely likely to get scratches and also cracking as there does not seem to be any kind of protective coating on the back of the case to prevent it from marring.The  Phone gets very hot when recharging the battery while it is in case (if you manage to be able to get the port door open with the case on).  A clear case similar to the design of Spigen's "Ultra Fit" shell design might be more desirable (if they can tone down the amber tint).Also the "Free" screen protector which is included appears to be smaller than the perimeter of the phone and leaves quite a sizable gap on each side. I did not install it, but by holding it against the phone and lining up the cut outs, the gap is quite noticeable.This product is Not recommended as it is currently designed- I am returning mine.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00I3ULVLQ" id="B00I3ULVLQ-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-08:</strong> Not what I expected</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00I3ULVLQ" id="B00I3ULVLQ-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-21:</strong> This case is great, and very stylish.

It's basically a bumper, except it's a case; the transparent back is nice because it doesn't totally obscure my device the way most cases do. The headphone jack is still accessible and my headphones with large plugs fit just fine. The buttons are nicely clicky. Despite the slim profile, this does add significant protection - I dropped my phone on concrete so badly that it bounced and I had to chase after it, and neither the phone nor the case show the slightest hint of damage. The case fits perfectly, and while the phone does not pop out by accident, removing the case is not difficult. Lastly, I have a qi wireless charging insert (not the enormous Samsung charging door) and it is able to charge through the case without any trouble.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00I3ULVLQ" id="B00I3ULVLQ-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-15:</strong> Looked good, but the borders got dirty really fast and easy to see.

But I also think the level of protrusion is insufficient for more serious drops.Pros:1)Fits my Galaxy S5 perfectly2)Looks nice3)Thin profile4)Reasonably priced.Cons:1)You should remove the two thin film coating prior to use.2)In my opinion, the outer protrusion which protects the screen is not thick enough to protect the screen from more serious drops.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00I3ULVLQ" id="B00I3ULVLQ-review21" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-11:</strong> The bumper case doesn't inhibit any features of the S5. The cut out for the headphone jack is even large enough that I can plug my Audio Technica ATH-M50's into it. That is something I haven't been able to do with other bumper cases. The case does make it a little harder to pop out the plastic cover for the charging jack on the S5. I have no problem using the finger print scanner with the case on but my finger does run across the edge of the case when I scan my finger.The Spigen bumper case has a larger single cut for both the camera and heart rate sensor on the back. It is large enough that I have no problem using the sensor with the case on. The Spigen case doesn't wrap around as much as some other bumper cases I've used, most likely because the S5's earpiece is about an 1/8&#34; from the top of the phone and smartphone screens are pushing closer to the phone's edges. Still, I feel there is no danger in the S5 unexpectedly coming out of the case, even if dropped.The case comes with a screen protector. The screen protector was easy to install. No screen cleaning wipes or cloths are included. No squeegee is included either, a credit card works just as good. The Spigen is a nice bumper case that offers a good amount of protection for the S5 and fits the phone properly. I recommend it to anyone looking for a bumper case for their new Galaxy S5.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00I3ULVLQ" id="B00I3ULVLQ-review22" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-27:</strong> Too flimsy to provide any protection and the &#34; Full HD *Japanese* Screen Protector&#34; that came with it was stuck to the inside of the case (nothing was covering the sticky side at all) and covered with dust and fingerprints.

Runs around the entire edge of the phone and lips over (in case your phone falls screen-first it'll hit the case and not your phone).  Since it's for the S5 the only thing I would adjust is the opening for the batter charger.  The S5's are 'water-proof' and the batter charger is covered with a removable cover for the batter port (in case you drop it in the bathtub water is unable to get into the phone via the charging port).  With this cover, I have to dig at it a bit to get the phone battery port cover off.  I'm a guy so I don't have long finger nails.  This is a non-issue for my wife.  Even for me it take all of 10 seconds to get it off.I would buy the case again in a heartbeat.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00I3ULVLQ" id="B00I3ULVLQ-review28" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-29:</strong> I bought this case a week ago and so far I like it. Its thin, doesn't add much weight or bulk to the phone, and the buttons feel good to press. The color scheme matches really well with the phone (I have the metal slate color). The transparent back is a nice touch to show off the S5's original appearance. The case offers good drop protection, I already dropped it a few times with no problems.The only problem I had is that the back gets a little greasy, and it does become a little slippery to grip. Also the front of the case doesn't really have a raised lip, so resting the glass on a surface may be an issue.The case also comes with a screen protector, but I can't speak for its quality because I used a different screen protector. But it is a nice touch from spigen.Overall its a great case and for the price its well worth it. Spigen makes functional and stylish cases.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00I3ULVLQ" id="B00I3ULVLQ-review29" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-05:</strong> Wasn't sure if I would like this case, but I must say it exceeded my expectations.

The fit is perfect, not just close, not neat here and loose there, it is perfect.The clear back is scratch resistant thus far and leaves the phone showing through. Why put a colored or opaque cover over a device that you buy for its aesthetics as much as its features? (or in the case of the iPhone, aesthetics are the only reason you would buy it.)It does add a little bulk, but just a little and it is worth it to protect a valuable toy like an S5. I have broken phones and a tablet and it is always because they fell and landed on a corner and the screen shattered from there. This case has extra padding on the corner to stop just that and yes, this adds some bulk but I can live with the bulk more than I can live with a shattered screen.I didn't add the clear screen protector.All holes align perfectly, charging cable and its cover easily open for charging.Well worth the cost of the case.If in doubt about which cover to buy for your S5, buy this one, you will not be sorry.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00I3ULVLQ" id="B00I3ULVLQ-review41" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-11:</strong> Ordered this since I didn't get a standard case from our COSTCO outlet when I bought my Galaxy S5. Arrived a bit early and I immediately tried it on. Fits like the proverbial glove with holes and bumps in all the right places. Love the transparent look since it immediately tells me what phone is on the inside.Case is very easy to put on and as others noted the front edges are slightly higher than the phone face to provide a smidge more protection for the glass. Not sure if that turns out to be significant if I drop the phone on its face but it sounds good.Since I haven't dropped the phone yet can't vouch for its protection abilities but at the moment I'm happy with the purchase.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00I3ULVLQ" id="B00I3ULVLQ-review42" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-27:</strong> Really enjoy this case, the backing covers the phone too and since it's clear, it doesn't really hide the beauty of the phone.

The matte finish does significantly cut glare, but I do find that it does significantly affect outdoor visibility in bright sunlight.  Also, because of the matte finish, it does affect the &#34;whites&#34;.  You will see &#34;coloured pixels&#34; on a white screen.  This is something to keep in mind if you're debating between a regular and matte screen protector.I knew this going in, but I didn't realize how much these issues would affect the screen output.On a screen with colours other than a lot of white, you won't notice the screen protector.Also, because of the curved screen of the N4, the screen protector itself is cut to a precise fit.  My placement is slightly off.  On one side/corner of my screen the protector is just a millimeter off, and on the other side, it's a millimeter too far.  Take your time when installing your screen protector.Also, because it is a matte screen protector, you don't get a &#34;protective cover&#34; on the non-stick surface like you would on a regular screen protector.  There is a little tag to identify the &#34;sticky&#34; side and remove its backing.What you get in the package is three screen protectors, a polishing cloth, a cardboard &#34;squeege&#34; and installation instructions.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AI6K5JW" id="B00AI6K5JW-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-06:</strong> Got this for my and my girlfriends' Nexus 4, after it arrived my first though was : &#34;OMG time to put a screen protector, entering 110% focus mode&#34;, was surprise to find out that it was easier than I thought, got to admit that lost one of the screens proctector for not reading propertly the instructions (my bad).Here are the reasons why I would recommend this.1) Fits perfectly2) Easy to adjust, even if you have to move it several times while getting it done3) Nice price/quality deal</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AI6K5JW" id="B00AI6K5JW-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-17:</strong> Easy to put on, seems to protect well.

I installed both and was happy with the nexus 5 version.The nexus 4 version had only one tab to remove the back protective layer (which protects the adhesive) whereas the nexus 5 version had the screen protector sandwiched between two protective layers each with a tab.The instructions said to remove tab 1, apply to the screen, then remove tab 2. But there was no tab 2. I contacted support and they said that there was no second tab in this particular protector and that the instructions were incorrect.Once I got it installed, I noticed it was very grey in the areas around the screen almost as if there was a trapped bubble (there was not). It also gave the whole screen a hazy, foggy look. Additionally, it gathered fingerprints immediately. The protector comes in a 3 pack, so I tried a different one in case one was defective. Same deal.The grey fogginess and haziness makes it very hard to see the screen in sunlight. Compared to my nexus 5, which is now easier to see in sunlight. I contacted support and they told me it's normal and there is no second tab but the instructions were just wrong for the nexus 4 version.While i found the nexus 5 version of this product to be really nice, I'd strongly recommend passing on the nexus 4 version. It just makes your screen too hazy to look at, and the feel of the protector is also very sticky/tacky.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AI6K5JW" id="B00AI6K5JW-review19" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-15:</strong> Fits perfectly, easy to apply, easy to follow instruction, quality product, good thing there are multiple protectors as they've done their job!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AI6K5JW" id="B00AI6K5JW-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-25:</strong> Great product, your instructions were made easier with your online video which really helped.

Screen protectors don't just fall on your phone and look perfect, so put some time into it!This screen protector fits the Nexus 4 perfectly with the right cuts for sensors and front facing camera.  Use your eyes and read, this is for the front glass only, not the back.  The protector is also cut shorter at the sides and bottom to allow for perfect installation on the Nexus 4's curved glass.  I use an i-blasen soft tpu case and it fits perfectly with the protector (the protector does not peel up).  I don't know how durable the protector will be as I've only used it for 2 days, but so far so good AND you get 3 in the pack.  An excellent value.Lastly I would like to comment on the packaging and extras included with the protectors.  I've purchased a lot of protectors over the last 3 years.  These are packed the best and include an actual REAL soft cloth (not some crappy thin tissue-like cloth), the bubble removal card is sturdy, AND you get tape to remove dust/lint particles in the event something blows on the screen while trying to install the protector.  The tape is just the right stickiness as well.  Finally, the instructions are in real English with no spelling errors or grammatical issues (YES, that makes a difference in the way you can perceive a product).Assuming I ever burn through the 3 I have, I would definitely buy these again.  I will update the review if that's not the case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AI6K5JW" id="B00AI6K5JW-review34" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-18:</strong> This was the easiest time I've ever had putting on screen protectors. Normally, it's the most frustrating experience, but these went on as easy as you would hope for. It's also nice that they come with everything you need all in one kit. As has been mentioned by others, they do not cover the whole screen, but this is intentional and the best solution for the curved screen of the Nexus 4. I haven't noticed any sort of color or clarity distortion, and the phone is just as responsive as it was without a screen protector. For the price you pay this is great value. (3 pck/$5.95) Nothing but good things to say.I do think it's funny that people complain that these don't cover the entire screen. Perhaps they should have read the reviews before making a purchase...I'd recommend that you use the hinge method for application.

The material is wavy and gross (you can see ripples all over the screen and the back glass) and it didn't feel good to touch. I highly recommend you stay away from it.As far as this Tech Armor goes, the fit is pretty good (unfortunately since the Nexus 4 has curved edges, it is impossible to have a screen protector made of the harder (more clear) plastics fit all the way to the edge because the curve does not allow the product to sit flush. So this product covers the entire FLAT part of the screen but doesn't go all the way to any of the edges of the actual glass. It does not obstruct the front facing camera or speakers. I kinda wish it at least went all the way up to the top and bottom (but it doesn't). Woulda have given it 5 stars if it did.It is a fantastic price for 3 screens (in case they get damaged or you totally screw up the install).I have also used this product on two iPhone 4's and it fit very very well and my father and friend are happy with it.All in all, if you want a good screen protector for your nexus 4, I recommend this one.***UPDATE*** If you install the screen protector close enough to the top, it will COVER the proximity sensors on the upper left corner of the phone which will make it impossible to use the phone once you make a call. Make SURE you either install it low enough to avoid covering the sensors or CUT OUT a small piece of the top left corner so you don't obstruct the sensors!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AI6K5JW" id="B00AI6K5JW-review36" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-06:</strong> Installing it was pretty simple.I think that it should be a little larger as there is a lot of exposed phone screen around it.

Buttons are easy to press through the rubber, none of the ports are blocked.  Doesn't interfere with screen protector.I don't use inductive charging nor touch-n-bump transfers, so I can't comment on that.  Kickstand works, reminds me of my old HTC Evo 4G.

The only gripe I have is one of the middle tabs snapped off at about 6 months of use.

I have bought probably 10 different car phone holder gadgets and all failed to hold the phone in place, break, or are too difficult to get the phone on and off (takes both hands). Some are so big they block my driving view. I even tried the sticky pad one. So I bought the Rokform magnet and a bright green silicon cover on Amazon. I took an old dashboard phone holder that still has a working suction cup and bendy stem, and too off the original clamp thingy, leaving only a flat rectangle of plastic with four nubs.  I put the magnet holder between the nubs (lucky fit), no glue or tape, and it holds my iphone 5 in a case (with metal plate inside), securely while driving. I bought the adhesive metal plates here also. You can stick them inside or outside the back of a phone case, on the phone itself, the magnet works even through the case . I can put it vertical or horizontal, take it on an off as often as I need to. I can do this with one hand, and don't have to look at the holder to do it. I am trying to justify buying more of these.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0071IBT2M" id="B0071IBT2M-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-08:</strong> Great add on to the case.

Very slim design, secure grip, perfect cutouts, quality material, and keeps the Samsung Note elegant. In other words, the case is not intrusive.  Also protects the rearcamera lens as Samsung had a slight oversight having the lens glass flush with their back cover and thus prone to being scratched.  This case also appreciably improves what I also feel is a "Hey Samsung, did you not try this with anyone" design where the on/off button is directly opposite the volume button. The tendency when wanting to do one has your finger on the opposite side for resistance so you press the other as well!!  (Samsung, put the on/off on the top.)  Well, the Elago G4 slim-fit case actually helps overcome this oversight because of the slight raised area of the case. And, of course makes the phone less slippery.  I went to the elagodesign site and their stuff is awesome AND inexpensive!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006IRLVVG" id="B006IRLVVG-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-16:</strong> Pros:- Slim, looks very nice and perfectly fits the Galaxy Note- Gel/plastic seems to be made of good quality, is fairly hard, but feels like it should provide very good protection for the phone.- The port cut-outs are generous but not too large. The cut-out for the S-pen allows adequate access is not that difficult.  There are also cut-outs for the power and volume controls which allows easy access to these buttons.Cons:- The Elago does not completely cover most of the top and bottom of the phone which could render it less protective in these areas compared to some of the other gel covers on the market.- It can be a bit difficult to remove this cover from the phone.- Despite the covers slim fit and nice looks, you still definitely loose some of the beauty of the Note with a gel cover.Summary:This is a decent cover for $11. As to be expected you will loose some of the beauty of the Note with any gel cover but overall, no regrets with this purchase.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006IRLVVG" id="B006IRLVVG-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-06-13:</strong> I've used this case for two month and my Galaxy note started crashing a lot, the touch screen didn't work at all...

I had ordered this case in black in the past from another seller which I was very very disappointed. It was a cheaply made case that missing the emblem as well as inside the case was not smooth & totally different than what seller was indicated in the picture & description. It lasted me only a few weeks.This time I saw it in brown & was available from a seller that I have bought other items before (Importer520). I ordered it gain. Despite DHL Global mail delivered it 8 days late, I was very impressed with the case. Unlike the previous case this case was exactly what was described. First of all it fits perfect for Galaxy Note II with silicone case on, but it may be slightly loose for a bare Note II.The case has smooth & soft leather like feel to it & inside is made of smooth velvety like fabric. The brown color outside the case is a very unique & beautiful brown with beige stitches that looks sturdy & very strong. The black gun metal color emblem adds a nice accent to the case & make it look like an expensive case. The belt clip & loops in the back makes it very stable & your phone will not go any where.The case is well made & I have been using it for a couple of months now holding up very well. This is the case that you will be paying well over $35 in Sprint or Verizon store. So if you order it, be careful which seller you order it from since the quality can be very different from seller to seller.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008OAH222" id="B008OAH222-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-28:</strong> This case fit well and the customer service was great and friendly.

The majority of Nokia's phones have glass screens with beveled edges.  When applied, it is impossible to get this screen protector to adhere to the screen around the edges, leaving a small exposed area at the outer edge of the film. This attracts all manner of dust and dirt. Eventually it just looks disgusting, and inevitably these edges get peeled up.  I went through all three of the included protectors very quickly, and eventually just removed the last one because of the size problem.Also, the matte finish is nice at times, but it really presents a problem when you're using the fine focus control on the camera.  I guess it's just the nature of it being a matte finish that makes it difficult to tell whether or not you have focused correctly.  As the camera is one of my primary uses of this phone, the screens didn't work for me from that perspective. It does provide a nice, glare-free surface for reading text, however.If these were slightly smaller so they would adhere completely on the flat glass surface, they would be functional. As is, I cannot recommend.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HETZSO8" id="B00HETZSO8-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-15:</strong> After trying numerous products I luckily stumbled upon mpero matte screen protectors.

Its matte so it will not be crystal clear but instead just a little foggy or just a tad bit dim. The matte though makes up for it by being well more fingerprint and oil resistant than a clear of glossy clear screen protector. Used it for a day now and it doesn't collect fingerprints like my old screen protector and provides a high degree of scratch resistance. The touch sensitivity is the same and no other ill effects. The protector is a tad bit smaller than the scree but that is because of the unique nature of how the glass is curved on the edges of the Nokia Lumia 1520. The cutouts are spot on and there is no blocking of the light sensor or front facing camera like some protectors. overall I give it 5 stars.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HETZSO8" id="B00HETZSO8-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-02:</strong> I've bought a lot of screen protectors for a lot of different devices.  I was impressed with this package because they even thought to include the pre-cut tape for easier dust removal once it gets trapped under the protector as you're installing it (and that happens a lot!)  I had zero issues installing this.  The trick is to go very slowly and use the included card to help push air bubbles out.  This protector installed very nicely, and you have three of them to boot.  As with any matte protector, you will see some degradation in color/detail of the phone's screen, but I don't care about that.  I do care about dealing with non-stop smudges and grime on the screen as well the glare that comes off it when I use it for navigation in my car.

Unfortunately mine was just a tiny bit too large for the Motorola Droid screen, so it does not adhere well to one of the edges.  Its really just a cosmetic issue, as it has stayed put for about three weeks now (under a Seidio Innocase).

Almost everything that I am about to say reiterates the instructions, which are detailed and provide optimum results if followed.- Read all of the instructions that come with it before you begin the process.- Thoroughly clean the screen.  Ideally you want to wipe it down with a lens cleaning cloth and then give it a quick shot with compressed air- Keep your fingers and the skin wet.- Use the install card to push the excess air and solution out as you go along (more on this later)- Yes, the bubbles go away.  However, the more you have, the longer it takes.  Expect 2-4 days.  In the first 24 hours, you will notice that the bubbles have shrunk.  They will continue to do so until they have disappeared completely.  A majority of the bubbles that I had on mine were only visible when the screen was off, so it did not affect the screen clarity.A few side notes:- The reason why the instructions tell you to keep your phone off for 12-24 hours is because liquids (i.e. the solution) and electronics don't mix.  It is to allow time to dry in the event that some of the solution gets inside any of the openings in your handset.- I thought that my install card was missing. I found it after I already installed the skin when I took the box completely apart.  What I didn't think of at the time is that a credit card would have been a good substitute.  That being said, I didn't use anything to push the excess air and solution out as I went along and I still had good results.- What the heck is a microbubble?  The best way that I can describe them is that they are tiny spheres that don't hinder the feel of the screen as opposed to air pockets or "blisters" that noticeably raise the skin off of the screen. It is possible to have a cluster of air bubbles that can raise the skin but these go away just as the others do.- The skin gives a little more "grip" to the screen, not enough to where you it changes the feel of the phone.  I actually kind of like it for tap functions but it will feel less smooth on slide functions.- I don't notice any difference in display quality.  Without the skin, the display has a very smooth, glass surface.  With the skin, it reminds me of the surface of a glossy notebook screen.This is very different from the generic, trim-to-size, multi-pack screen protectors that just don't work.

It is very nervewracking to put a completely wet screen cover on a brand new expensive to replace phone. Additionally after applying the film I noticed there were tons of micro bubbles that looked like a patch of pyschedelic discoloration. The provided tool does not flatten these out, it only gets rid of the larger bubbles. After about 1 day of use 95% of the discoloration was gone and thena after 2 days it was completely gone with only the clear and shinny cover remaining. Be warned that you better be very careful when you apply this film because if you get water in the ear hole or in other parts of the phone you can damage it. Read the directions very carefully. As a side note the cover serves as a sort of finger print mask.One of the things I hated prior to getting this cover was how easily all my fingerprints and smuges showed, this hides them quite well with only a minor wipe required to clean the screen every once in a while.

There is no way to install this without getting one or two spec's of dust stuck under the protector. Make sure you read everyone's review on how to install this.This screen has many micro bubbles stuck under it and is not scratch proof. Do not use the applicator card that comes with it. It will permanently scratch your skinomi as it did to mine. I have had this screen protector on for 2 weeks and all these imperfections have not disappeared like everyone else claims. All in all when I turn on my Droid you can not see these imperfections.The life time replacements are a scam you have to pay 6-7 dollars to ship one to you so you might as well buy it again and get a new spray bottle.**Edit** I wanted to comment that customer service is actually great and they take care of customers that are not completely satisfied.

To install it, you're supposed to be ultra-clean, make it wet (great idea: electronics and water), and squeeze the bubbles out, but  the result didn't look good.

I just pulled it off and threw the whole wet, sticky mess into the trash.The protector is so thick and slick that I don't think it would have been good even if if it were installed perfectly.

I searched the forums, visited Verizon, threw fits and sulked that my phone wasn't as good as I'd expected. Then I bought this. Suddenly, I was back on 4G. The problem was so stupid: The previous extended battery came with a replacement door to accommodate the bigger battery. I hadn't realized the the Tbolt's antenna is in the back cover. The antenna on the older one was absolute garbage. This one is perfect. Now I've got two working extended batteries and one back cover with working antenna. I couldn't be happier.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004TEYPMM" id="B004TEYPMM-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-11-05:</strong> I'm sure everyone knows how poor the battery life on these gigahertz phones are, so it was a no brainer upon upgrading from my Droid Incredible (which I bought the ext. battery for also) to the Thunderbolt that I got an extended battery for it, and since I'm away from home for 12+ hours of the day I wanted to be sure I had power left in the battery when I wanted to use the phone for something more than just a call, or text. We don't have 3G in the area (we barely have 3G) that I live in, so I really can't say how long the battery lasts in a constant 4G environment. I can tell you though that if I leave the phone idle with this battery in it, it will last about 2 days, and I don't turn off background sync, live wallpapers, GPS, or Blutooth! Needless to say I'm not frugal with my phones power consumption. With that said, I can still kill this battery under heavy use in about 6 hours. This is a big improvement over the stock battery however, with that battery I'd be lucky to get 2.5 hours under the same abuse or maybe 4 if I turned everything off, and dimmed the screen. Whats the point in that? lol! I have been in a 4G area with this phone since putting this battery in, and have not noticed any issues getting a 4G signal, sooo maybe the previous poster got a defective door or phone?... It happens sometimes. Overall I would recommend this battery to anyone with a Thunderbolt, it does add some bulk to the phone, but if you can live with that then your good, its not like these phones are small anyway lol</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004TEYPMM" id="B004TEYPMM-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-04-28:</strong> I have had other extended batteries in the past, this HTC battery was never a "real" extended battery, it only gave a marginal improvement over the regular battery. It used to be very expensive too. After 6 months I was forced to discard this battery. Now it barely holds enough juice for half a day of regular use even though I always have 4G turned off. This is not normal. Clearly there is something wrong with this product.

This extended battery has solved that problem.  Though it adds a noticeable bulge and heft to the phone, neither is an issue for me; and actually makes the phone easier to hold - less likely to slip from my hand as the original slim profile could.My only gripe is that one side of the extended cover doesn't snap into place as snugly as the other side, leaving it feeling like it might pop off; so I may return it for a replacement.  (Update: I should have returned this but it's too late now.  The poor-fitting battery cover seems to be loosening up over time and requires that I constantly check it.)Battery life seems excellent.  On one rare occasion when I had the phone on all day at work, the battery appeared down by about half at the end of the day.  Though I didn't use it much that day, I'm guessing that the battery drain was due to constant signal searching in a poor indoor reception area.  Otherwise, no 4G reception issues with the battery cover antenna that some have reported.Yes, it's worth getting, but hope your battery cover fits better than mine.  (Update: I no longer think this is worth buying from this seller.  I originally contacted them about the poor fitting cover and they wanted me to send them a photograph of the defect.  Never got around to that, but if they were more customer oriented, they should have immediately sent me a replacement and return label for the defective cover.)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004TEYPMM" id="B004TEYPMM-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-10:</strong> Buy one!  You know the normal battery doesn't last even half a day, in any circumstances.  Well, it might last half a day if you leave your phone turned off and only turn it on to place calls.  But even then, I suspect the battery would still be drained before lunch...But, this extended battery?  I can actually make it through the workday without having the phone plugged in to charge at all.  Yes, I do have to turn 4G off for that, but when I go to conference and just want to make sure that I am available and won't be able to plug in all day and don't want to be carrying a bag full of batteries to swap every two hours, this solves the problem!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004TEYPMM" id="B004TEYPMM-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-17:</strong> fits and works well, only issue is it's now too big for her covers and need to locate a new cover...</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004TEYPMM" id="B004TEYPMM-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-10:</strong> This battery and case are the perfect fit to anyone looking to get more power for their phone.

I would love to buy another one but there are too many other designer phone cases to enjoy.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006WVZT3O" id="B006WVZT3O-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-15:</strong> took a long time to come in, its hard to put on, and its hard to take off and the little stones come off really easy</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006WVZT3O" id="B006WVZT3O-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-14:</strong> I love the design of this - so cute and girly!

I don't like that you have to press really hard on the bottom button (don't have this problem on my 5 case), and most annoying is that the bottom flap won't stay closed.  My son says he can get it to close if he tries hard, but who wants to try hard??I also dislike how there is a gap between the screen and the screen cover - ever so slightly, but again - more so than my 5 case.

No, I'm not insane but I just kept trying to find one that would work out for me. I've had the blue, red, black, white and lavender.The problem is that when you have a black car interior, black car seat covers and a black purse it is real easy to give yourself a coronary every time you can't find your Iphone - as I have. And I refuse to give up the Defender model since it is practically indestructable.This case is outstanding. The back has a lovely light brown to dark brown woodsy picture that has bright orange higlights around it. The front is bright orange surrounded by black. I cannot misplace it. And it isn't an obnoxious orange either. Unfortunately I am not a "pink" or "yellow" person, so those colors were not options. But I needed something bright, classy and Defender. Problem solved.I also like the fact that Otter Box upgraded the material for this case. It is no longer that stretchy, rubbery fabric that could not slide into my pants pocket without sticking, therefore making it impossible to just grab the phone when you needed it.  The case has a solid feel to it which is entirely in keeping with the point of owning a Defender.Okay so I had to make adjustments and buy some extender cables to connect my Iphone to various speakers and docking stations in my home.  Big whoopee. Far less of an expense and inconvenience then replacing my Iphone.There is nothing out there that equals the Defender case and nowhere that equals Amazon's pricing and product protection.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHQBS" id="B005SUHQBS-review24" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-10:</strong> This one was bought for my husband.

I bought this January of 2014 and until last week I thought I had made the right choice.  There are three adjustment points allowing you to articulate it a number of different ways and the overall build quality feels pretty darn good.  The suction cup seems to be the Achilles heel here.Last week the adhesive gave out and the thing came flying at me like a spider monkey.  The suction cup does not work for more than 15 minutes at a time anymore and it left a giant brown stain on my dash.  It's probably too late to get a refund, but maybe there is still a warranty on it.  Either way given my experience I'd steer clear...I'd also be wary of the 5 star reviews.  Up until last week I would have given it a very favorable rating, but fortunately I held off this time.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BR3O4CE" id="B00BR3O4CE-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-03:</strong> This product turned out to be WAY better than I thought it would.(Update)This works great with an iPad Air in an Apple case.  There is just enough adjustment in the clamp to make this work.-------------------original review--------The GoodTo start, it looked really chunky to me online.  Thankfully, it looks much better in real life. The suction cup is super sticky and sticks well to rough surfaces and is almost impossible to get off of smooth surfaces.  The spring loaded mechanism is great and with the rubber inserts removed, I can fit an iPad 3 in a Zerochroma case no problem.  I originally purchased this on impulse for an out of state rental car road trip but now use in daily in my own car.The Not So GoodIt works well, but it isn't magic so be careful.  A few reviewers have commented this looses suction after a while.  It does, it is a suction cup so expect that at some point, it might fall.  That said, I would not mount this in a place where if it falls, your device will break.  In my car, I mount it to the passenger side of the console between the console and seat.  Mine has come loose twice (clumsy passenger hit it pretty hard with her purse) but it was easy enough to re-attach.The star deduction is because this ought to have a replaceable suction cup.  Suction cups don't last forever.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BR3O4CE" id="B00BR3O4CE-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-17:</strong> Stand doesn&#8217;t stay in place when you adjust it. It will randomly drop if you prop it up, slamming the ipad down pretty hard. Because of this I have to leave it propped on the table, which isn&#8217;t what I was looking for. It also takes up a ton of space when you have to keep it on the table since the suction cup extends so far back. If you want adjustability or want to put this on something small like a nightstand, I would suggest saving your money and finding a better one that doesn&#8217;t have a flawed design.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BR3O4CE" id="B00BR3O4CE-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-06:</strong> The iOttie Easy Smart Tap allows users to customize the mount in multiple ways  to find the best fit for usage (see video for details). The mount features a one-hand mounting system that snaps into place by pushing back on the iPad once it is in the mount. The build quality is great and seems to hold up really well.The mount comes with the instruction manual that details how to put the mount together as it does come with a few pieces. The mount comes with a shock mount like rubber piece that helps reduce the amount of vibrations that the product gets from use in the car.The adhesive  suction cup on the bottom allows for use in the car or desk or on many other flat surfaces. The suction cup can be rinsed off with water and air dried after use to restore it to mint condition. The adhesive is very strong and holds up well on flat surfaces.The mount has three different knobs that can be adjusted for different purposes. The knob closest to the base (where the suction cup is located) moves the arm that holds the iPad vertically and changes the angle of the mount. The middle knob adjusts the length of the arm so the mount can be placed towards the back of a desk for maximum desk usage. The last knob is a ball-head joint and it controls the movement of the iPad after the other knobs have been adjusted. This knob changes the angle of the actual iPad and not the mount like the first knob mentioned. Also, this knob allows users to change the orientation of the iPad from landscape to portrait and vice versa.The versatilely of this mount is something I enjoy because it allows me to customize the iPad to my liking. As a desk mount (or on other surfaces), it can be used  to play games, used as a secondary monitor, for looking up a recipe in the kitchen, among many other uses. As a car mount, it can be used for GPS, allowing passengers to watch a movie or listen to music. There are many ways to use the mount and for the price of a typical case, anyone looking for a stand or mount should look to the iOttie Easy Smart Tap to deliver.I would recommend the Easy Smart Tap to those looking for a way to mount their iPads at home or in the car, otherwise choose a case if you are always on the go because the mount focuses mainly on an at-home kind of use. I would use a case to bring my iPad on the go because it provides protection and is more travel- friendly then the more permanent solution - the iOttie mount. Otherwise, the Easy Smart Tap is a good solution for home use that is easy to set up and allows for multiple uses and functionality.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BR3O4CE" id="B00BR3O4CE-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-12:</strong> Does not fit the Nexus 10.  I repeat, does not fit the Nexus 10.  I thought I had read a review where someone said this mount holds a Nexus 10 tablet so I ordered one.  After I received it and tried to fit my Nexus 10 (without any case at all), I found that the laptop is about 0.5 inches too wide for this mount. Now I need to ask Mr. Dremel Tool to modify the mount so I can use it with my Nexus 10.I have no idea how this works with iPads but do not buy this if you are looking for a car mount for your Nexus 10.  Other than the problem with not fitting my tablet, the rest of the mount seems to follow IOttie's high build quality.  I've got another iOttie car mount for my Galaxy S4 and that thing is a rock.  I just wish this mount would have accomodated my Nexus 10.  iOttie needs to build a mount for the Nexus 10 owners of the world.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BR3O4CE" id="B00BR3O4CE-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-09:</strong> The most important thing I will say is this stuff STICKS.

My wife has this same case design on her Nexus 7 and I thought it was pretty cool and got it for my white S4. Case makes the phone easy to hold, does not add much thickness to it, all the ports are cut out well, and the button are easy to push. My only gripe about the case is the android guy not showing up as well as my wife's purple Nexus 7 case. I'm not sure if it is due to the Nexus being black and my phone being white, but it is not as easy to see as the Bugdroid Circuit design that I have for my S4.

The left and right edges have a ribbing and texture that makes it very easy to hold.  The Andy logo on the back of the case is essentially at the same height as the background, with the brushed look giving it color --- run your finger on the back of the case, and you really don't feel a depression --- so you really don't mind the feel of the logo in your palm.  It also looks really nice when you have the phone on the table, screen down.Cruzerlite has begun my TPU case of choice for all of my phones moving forward.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BLGVE1Q" id="B00BLGVE1Q-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-30:</strong> Unless you love throwing your phone on the floor, this is all the protection you need.

Do you want a case that fits very loosely on your phone that is likely to start coming off in your pocket?  Do you like it when you try to push the power button or volume but instead push the case right off the side of the phone?  If you do then this is a great case.The case is loose on the sides.  The way the rubber is, it just doesn't wrap the sides tight, so most often the front face sides are exposed.  The thin piece of rubber over the volume rocker and power button are super loose and flimsy and gets caught on everything whether in a bag or in your pocket.  I purchased 3 of these after all the great reviews and returned all three of them after trying them on several phones.What could make this case better:1. A little tighter case, maybe stiffer plastic along the sides so it actually covers the phone.2. No cutouts for the volume and power buttons.  I think this would strengthen the sides along with removing loose flimsy rubber that snags everything.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BLGVE1Q" id="B00BLGVE1Q-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-05:</strong> Fits well and I think gives just enough cushioning on the corners to hopefully prevent screen damage when dropped.

The price is low, and there were a few negative reviews that really threw me off.If you are careful with your phone and do not drop it all the time, then this case is PERFECT. The design is beautiful and I get compliments on it everywhere I go.The sides are hard plastic, so if you drop this case it may crack (which happened to me). The crack in my case is so small that it does not matter though, and I am still using the case today over a month since the crack initially happened. The crack is barely visible to the eye, but I am sure that a few more drops might break it completely. I do not intend to do that, but accidents do happen.This is why I said this case is perfect for users who are careful with their phones. If you are a Superman fan, and have desire to own this case, I think you should definitely make the purchase.The only thing that would make this better is if the sides were the slightly softer TPU material, rather than hard plastic. For the price (and incredibly fast shipping for coming from Hong Kong), I definitely recommend this product.I rated this 4 stars only because the case does not offer ample protection.

They came exactly as described, 3 screen protectors for the screen and 3 for the back. They applied on well, didn't have too much trouble but they stuck on nice and air bubbles were easily squeezed out. There is one small air bubble on the screen I can't get out but that's due to a dust particle getting onto the sticky side of the screen protector. Remember to stay in a dust-free environment to avoid dust particles sticking onto the screen protector and causing bubbles!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0061XLUSG" id="B0061XLUSG-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-13:</strong> It fits ok on my iPhone 4S, used all of them trying to get it on.

I looked through amazon and this product had high ratings, but from my prior experiences with cheap screen protectors I was kind of hesitant at first. The price was so low I had nothing to lose, so I ordered this product anyways. Without knowing what to expect, I applied the front protector and to say the least I was astonished. The product was very easy to install and applied very easily. Both front and back protector are sized perfectly and it was really hard to tell that the phone had screen protectors installed.

We'll see how it holds up over time, it does seem to be working well and went on pretty easily.EDIT: Changed this to two stars because I've only had it a week and it's getting all warped and bubbly and there's a ton of dings in the screen protector already. If this is  Military Shield then I feel bad for the military because they're screwed.EDIT #2: I'm downgrading this to 1 star because it is AWFUL!!!! I've had it for a few months and the screen protector has a zillion dings and bubbles that never went away, the sensitivity is awful and I often find myself banging on my phone to get it to work, even though I have the increased sensitivity option on.

In the five months prior I had had numerous complaints of poor call quality as well as many dropped calls.  During the same time period, once I was outside the metro areas, I frequently noted only one or two bars.  After installing the device and cradling my iPhone 5 (which incidentally you have to insert upside down if you need to use the headphone port - Not a big deal) I placed a few test calls, which went well.  A few weeks after getting the device I talked with a coworker in California for the entire length of my commute with no drops and no cut outs.  Since the end of October, I only have had a couple of dropped calls and I assume that they were on the other end.  During my drives now, when I glance down I typically have five bars and only sometimes four.I paired this purchase with Plantronics Voyager Legend Bluetooth Headset.

I have owned 3 different Sleeks and some of the other Wilson Signal Boost products and one thing I have noticed with ALL of them... they degrade over time for some reason and eventually do not provide the same boost as they do when brand new.  I have never contacted Wilson to find out why this is.  The holder/antenna on the Sleek is not very adaptable to today's different kinds of devices either.  As one other reviewer mentioned... the bottom legs on this holder do not move.  My device is very tall with the antenna near the top and so I cannot place the device in the optimal position.  Wilson really needs to redesign the Sleek to be more configurable to different types of devices.  This is an okay product, but could be much better IMHO.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003NQ5NWI" id="B003NQ5NWI-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-26:</strong> Nice, well made unit but does not seem to do anything on my Samsung SIIIIt does however work well on my old Thunderbolt phone.

The antenna mount is worth the piece by its self. I tried to make my own and had poor results. the desk stand is helpful but has a few issues (see issue two below). the home kit has a nice bag that fits the whole kit in one nice package.I have had two issues with the cradle over the past 3 weeks. First, the side plastic things (hands) that hold the phone are not sized right for the thin iphone 5. it will work but the smallest plastic hands on the farthest in setting hold the phone but they bend in enough to make the outer 10% of the screen hard to touch. I have no case on my phone but using one should help this. I could also just cut the plastic tabs shorter. My moms iphone 4 in a hard case had no issues so bigger phones are fine.Seconds issue is with the home mount kit. the attachment point for the cradle to the gimble base is loose and works well in vertical mode. put it into landscape mode off balance the whole thing and it tips over. the Iphone 5 is one of the lightest phones out there so bigger phones must have it worse. I can make it work most of the time by putting a book on the desk stand but its a design flaw. The weight needs to be hung more to the left if the cords for the power and antenna are going to come off the right.2.17.13 update:Still working great! I use it 8-24 hours a day and love it.one note, it does get warm after long usage, it will make my Iphone5 very hot if I am say watching a video on the tv via steaming and using a lighting to HDMI adapter. It could be that the phone is getting hot and has no place to dump heat but the booster holder it is in. this is only a minor deal and I still enjoy this device.3/1/2 update:I tried using this cradle for two phones last night and it worked! Instead of putting the phone in flat I made a triangle out of the phones and cradle. and both iphone 5's got boosted 4g service! I uploaded a photo of the setup to the images of the device.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B003NQ5NWI', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B003NQ5NWI', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B008S3MB7G</h2>    <p class="price"> $B008S3MB7G</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008S3MB7G" id="B008S3MB7G-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-10:</strong> This case fits perfectly and does exactly what I want.

The case is actually only clear on the side edges and frosted on the back, so you won't see your cover color but from the sides.Not frosting the case sides also allows it to retain some of the TPU grippy-ness that I like but I wish that they'd chosen to not frost the back and allow the natural color of the back to show through.The cut-outs for the top and bottom microphones are each a touch off center--not enough to block them, but enough to make me wonder if the sound will be muffled or diminished, since they are not centered on the cut-outs.The headphone jack cut-out is OK but not perfect as well. A standard headphone with a straight, tapered, housing will fit, but an angled one with a thick housing was not a fit without stretching the cutout hole away from the plug (not easy).I really like that the side buttons are protected (too easy to press without protection).Now my sleek-slim Galaxy has turned into more of the old Treo look with the added thickness and the rounded back.

I'm going to try to stretch/reshape it a little bit using a heat gun/hair dryer... might work?</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008S3MB7G" id="B008S3MB7G-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-16:</strong> This case looks good on the extended battery phone and keeps the face off the table because of the raised bumper around the face.  My case was slightly deformed and didn't fit as well as it should.  It was difficult to get on straight, and the power button did not align exactly.  This made it unfriendly to turn on or off.

If they fix this and get rid of that slippery back part, this would be a 5 Star.  Only reason I'm giving it 4 is because every other brand has a massive logo embossed on it.  If ya want to throw a sticker or anything on this, it's a clean slate.  Case does work fine, but as I said, holes do not line up perfectly.  Holes for Camera, LED and Speaker are to wide and long on the bottom of them.  Holes for 3.5mm jack, Noise Canceling Mic, Micro USB, and Microphone are also barely big enough on one side and too big on the other side.UPDATE: Dropped from 4 stars to 3 due to an issue I have finally diagnosed.  The aforementioned poor hole alignment has caused my charging cable to disconnect while charging overnight.  My QCell TPU case does not have this issue as it is cut nicer.  When plugged in, the charging cable actually bumps the case up a bit.  Wife nor I have never had this issue with my QCell TPU case (which she uses exclusively while I rotate between my two).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008S3MB7G" id="B008S3MB7G-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-15:</strong> I received the item mentioned by due date.

I was a little disappointed because it is clear plastic (pink) and not solid, which is what I wanted.  It ended up being just like a similar item I bought on Ebay, but the Ebay item came with a plastic backing that fit perfectly to my phone (unfortunately without the battery).  I couldn't use it because my extended battery (Zero Lemon) was too big.  The flexible back fits over my large battery perfectly well and holds the battery without a plastic backing.  While I was disappointed because it was exactly the same as what I had already purchased (I wanted a solid pink one).  It holds up quite well and I recommended it.  The pink is pretty and I like it asthetically over the perfectly fine and servicable black backing that Zero Lemon provides with their battery.  BTW the wristband is an ugly black and yellow with the company logo and serves no purpose.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008S3MB7G" id="B008S3MB7G-review37" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-27:</strong> I am happy with it.

Finally have some grip on my phone (AT&T; Galaxy S III) with an Extended battery cover for a 4500mAh battery. Had my doubts as it was advertised for a 4200mAh battery.The cutouts fit fine, except for the audio jack. I can not plug in my headset as the plastic from the jack hits the plastic over the hole. I tried nudging it in at no avail...might have to resort to a little cutting. The 2 mic openings and the charger cutouts fit perfectly as do the cutouts in the back for speaker, camera, and flash.The case wraps nicely over the top of the phone (screen), enough to provide good protection, but not too much as to interfere with my screen protector.As another reviewer mentioned, the plastic on the sides is a bit softer and has a better gripping feel than the back, which is not a major problem for me though.The side volume and power buttons are covered perfectly by the case, and I actually find this great, as before I inadvertently was pressing either one by accident. Now it takes a little harder press on it to change the volume or press the power button.So all in all I love this case, with just the small issue described on the headset jack.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008S3MB7G" id="B008S3MB7G-review46" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-23:</strong> Needed a plastic case to replace cracked one and these did not fit the bill.

It looks good. It has a nice, tight fit. In fact, you have to be quite forceful with it to put it on or take it off. The price is fair for the quality of material.I was decidedly pleased with the purchase until I went to charge the phone. The USB port is ever-so-slightly covered by case (as is the microphone hole). The cutouts are quite generous in size, but slightly misaligned.You have to pull the case up slightly to push even the tiniest of USB plugs into the case. Some plugs, like the one that comes with the S3, take a lot of work to plug in and the downward push of the case on the plug caused it to get unplugged overnight and therefore left the phone uncharged.Samsung phones have notoriously delicate ports and cables. I'm concerned that anything but the smoothest insertion is probably not good for the phone.Yes, I have tried putting on the case giving some bias to the bottom cutouts as there is some give to the case.Sorry, I wanted to like it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008S3MB7G" id="B008S3MB7G-review63" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-06:</strong> The case fits snugly.

The phone is a nice size and looks great in a case, so I never felt tempted to stray because it was truly a dream, combined with Google voice, for unlimited talk at home...but then I woke into a nightmare.I started having problems with my battery about 3 weeks ago. Thought maybe it was my charger, so bought new USB cables.  Still had the same issues with the phone constantly dying, so bought a new battery, but old and new batteries drain within an hour from 100%.Out of options, and desperate not to repeat the mistake of being stuck with a useless phone and no recourse, I switched to Verizon. A little nervous because my new phone is also a Samsung (note 3), but I opted in for full coverage/warranty/support.I already miss my $30/month plan, but I am enjoying unlimited minutes everywhere and Samsung seems to be trying harder to make better quality products, but if the note 3 doesn't last, I will be done with that company forever.I decided to switch to a different carrier because I had bad connections in some areas with t-mobile. I also had those same problems in those area when I had sprint and at&t;, but so far no problems with verizon (though it does switch to 3g and drop down to only a few bars in some of those problem areas, but it's hardly noticeable).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0079NRQH6" id="B0079NRQH6-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-06:</strong> I really really like the Samsung line, and this was the 3rd galaxy s II I have purchased since early 2013.

Why 1 star then? Because I purchased this one from Amazon (Ross Cellular was the seller) as a gift for my wife which turned out to be a piece of junk!Upon arrival, the phone box wasn't showing the slightest sign that it's for a Tmobile phone, or even a Samsung phone. Some weird generic looking box. The phone arrived with a flimsy battery that isn't original, white in color unlike the grayish Samsung looking battery, no Samsung logo/label on it, and no NFC antenna on it. The phone itself doesn't show any Samsung/Tmobile logo on the front like the other Sgh-t989 phones you would purchase in the US market regularly.Upon operating the phone, the battery life time appeared to be horrible. We thought it would need some power cycling before performing optimally, so we kept it for a few days. Two weeks of use and the phone refused to turn on. We took out the battery and tried it on another phone, and it worked. That made us doubt the phone itself. It was just dead, refusing to turn back on, charge, or do anything for that matter.Don't purchase stuff from Ross Cellular, you have been warned.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0079NRQH6" id="B0079NRQH6-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-09:</strong> I got this phone and it was great!

I've rooted it so that I can get even more creamy goodness out of it.  That means that I can do a few things that you can't do with it out of the box.  One of those things is to use this JKase Micro USB OTG cable to plug a USB flash drive into my Nexus 7.In my humble opinion, there are really only 2 minor flaws that keep the Nexus 7 from being the perfect device.  1) A quality rear camera (and you could argue that it's not necessary on a tablet) and 2) Expandable storage.  But with this cable, that second issue is mitigated.I travel semi-frequently and when I have to get on a plane, it's nice to be able to watch movies to pass the time.  But I don't want to suck up the 16GB of onboard storage with movies.  So with this great little cable, I plug my flash drive into the Nexus 7 right on the plane, then use StickMount to mount the drive.The cable has been very reliable.  I've not had any issues with disconnection or long term access.  I've already watched a couple of full length movies through this guy.  I'm even able to tuck the little storage laden pigtail into the triangle made available by my Nexus 7 case when it's in landscape &#34;stand mode&#34;.Bottom line:  It's a safe purchase if you're wanting to be able to expand the storage on a Google Nexus 7 tablet.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008FU34C8" id="B008FU34C8-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-24:</strong> Had to send one of these to a client, so I had Amazon direct mail to them.

I've had it installed for several weeks now and my phone has worked perfectly ever since and I no longer have any battery issues!This kit came with everything that I needed to fix my phone. I will say though, it's probably wise to use another phone to take pictures of what everything looks like each step of the way when you begin disassembling your phone.

I can highly recommend this kit if you have trouble with your old battery.Just a quick advice on keeping Lithium batteries alive longer. Avoid heat! These batteries go bad when they are hot. The other thing that makes these batteries age faster (meaning they lose their ability to hold charge) is always topping them off.

Some of the reviews were good and some were bad.  I thought I'd take a chance and try and replace my own battery.  There are some great videos on YouTube on how to replace the battery of the iPhone 5.  The first thing to do is to remove the screws on the side of the iPhone.  The enclosed screw drivers were way too large and did not have the correct type head.  The iPhone 5 has a star shaped hole in the screw head.  The kit I received had a Phillips type head which if you did use you could, with sufficient pressure, remove the screw heads at the expense of rounding out the entire head of the screw.  There was no suction cup enclosed which is needed to remove the cover from the unit.  I happened to have a suction cup that I use in the bathroom which I used to try and remove the cover.  There were a couple of tools to help pry the cover from the unit, but I could not get them to work.  At this point I gave up and went to an Apple dealer and had them replace the battery with an original Apple battery.  Rather than go through the hassle of returning the tool set, I just gave the battery to the Apple dealer and told him to do what he wanted with it.  Needless to say, I am very disappointed with the tool kit and I would not recommend it to anyone looking to replace the battery on their iPhone 5.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CW2S3BC" id="B00CW2S3BC-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-27:</strong> Symptoms that led me to buy this...-Really fast charge times-usage time cut in half-as soon as charger is plugged in, battery jumps up 5-10 percent-phone dies while showing 15-25 percent battery lifeKit arrived in 3 days. Was nervous about attempting this, but it was actually quite easy, after watching a few videos.Screws are tiny, so be gentle.Found it best to place the suction cup directly over the home button, while gently prying the screen up. (Pay attention to the connectors toward the top of the screen. They can easily be broken)The stock battery is held in by some ridiculously strong adhesive, so you'll have to do some prying. Just be careful not to damage the other internals of the phone.When attaching the battery's plug, do not force it, because you'll damage the tiny pins.When closing the screen, ensure that the top edge slides into the slots first, then snap the rest of the screen into place.10 mins and $10, was way better than paying Apple $80</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CW2S3BC" id="B00CW2S3BC-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-22:</strong> worked great</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00CW2S3BC', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00CW2S3BC', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B003E3HPD0</h2>    <p class="price"> $B003E3HPD0</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003E3HPD0" id="B003E3HPD0-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-26:</strong> I bought this mainly because of the length.

Around the same time, the same thing was happening with my car charger, so it may have been the phone (though no problems with other chargers...). I contacted the company (ezestand) with exactly that story, and they promptly sent out a replacement cord, no questions asked. In fact, when I opened the package I was pleasantly surprised to see that they had included an extra! So now I have 2 well-functioning cords.

The Droid Razr MAXX I had before had the charging port on the top of the phone (annoying!) the HTC has it on the side.  This cable is really convenient for side charging ports.  Unfortunately, it cannot carry the high current required to operate and charge most higher end smartphones.  Using my Droid Incredible 4G LTE the maximum current I've seen the phone receive is 350mA.  I have tried it with both an 850mA Motorola OEM USB wall charger and a 2A Nook Color USB wall charger.  In both cases the phone didn't receive more than 350mA.  I did both tests with the phone in airplane mode to ensure the radios didn't interfere with the charge rate.For the price, and for overnight charges only (I keep this cable plugged in next to the bed and only use it at night), it's an ok cable at best.  A much better extended cable option is here:Mediabridge - USB 2.0 A-Male to Micro-B Cable (6 Feet)The mediabridge cable can provide as much current as you can throw at it, though they don't make a right angle cable sadly :(.  I use the Mediabridge when I travel (see my full review on it's product page) and this right angle cable at home only.  I wish the right angle cable could carry the full current as it is much more comfortable to hold, but just can't keep up with the power needs of higher end devices.  The mediabridge cable is also a thicker diameter cable and has much higher quality connectors on both the standard USB and micro USB side.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003E3HPD0" id="B003E3HPD0-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-16:</strong> When a straight micro USB cable takes up too much room to place things the way you want, this one does the trick... perfectly.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003E3HPD0" id="B003E3HPD0-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-16:</strong> I bought this for my Phablet and it is a perfect fit.

And anyone who has this phone knows how horrible it is on battery life.  I had to buy an external battery pack just so I can make it through a day with my "cordless" cell phone.  Aside from the obvious hassle of constantly being tethered to my external battery pack, I was getting a little annoyed with the micro USB cable that came with my phone -- the plug on a standard micro USB cable sticks out WAY too far from the phone and makes it inconvenient to keep the phone in your pocket.  Hence the need for a right angle cord.  But beware, not all right angle cords are created the same!!  Once plugged in, most of them will send the cord UP the body of your phone.  But this one sends the cord DOWN the body of my phone, making it more convenient to use AND get in and out of my pocket while connected.  PERFECT!  And the cable is nice and long too!!  Added bonus since most cut corners by keeping the cords short.  Great cable for a great price and really good quality.  If you need one of these cords, this is the one to get!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003E3HPD0" id="B003E3HPD0-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-08:</strong> Item worked great for about a month.

They look way too fragile, it's too easy to jam one in at a bad angle and bend or break the little tab inside your phone. Mishandling a device when connected, or worse, dropping it can snap it off completely. Such things have happened to my family members twice now. A good precaution is one of these angled connectors. It really reduces the connection profile, which limits the amount of bad leverage exerted on your device's connector if it's mishandled. I got this in the mail today and love it. It's the right length and conforms nicely to devices. Right away I ordered more. Anyone want to buy some slightly used straight micro USB cables? I've got several I won't need anymore. :-)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003E3HPD0" id="B003E3HPD0-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-21:</strong> It works but the cord is somewhat flimsy.

The AV cable plugs into the micro USB port on the phone and allows composite audio and video to be output.  Because this blocks the only way to charge the phone, the AV cable has a port on the side to plug a charger in.  But if you plug the normal charger in, you end up with a "T" looking arrangement that is a bit unwieldy.Enter this cable.  This plugs into the side of the connector and then angles the cable to follow the AV cable, even to be zip tied together if desired.  I spent a lot of time closely inspecting connectors to find the right one to fit the HTC AV cable and THIS is the one that works best.Note: On the Incredible, when plugged into the phone by itself, the cord goes up toward the volume buttons.  You may want that, but if you want it to point down while the phone is vertical, you would want a left angle plug.  I believe this is opposite of the Droid X.UPDATE 5/3/11: Just got an HTC Thunderbolt and it works great with this phone too.  However, it bends the opposite way as it does on the incredible, so while the Incredible had the cord bend and go up toward the volume buttons, on the Thunderbolt it bends and goes toward the phone bottom (points down, as I think it does on the X).  Just an FYI, in case someone is searching.UPDATE 1/11/13: Also points down on HTC Rezound, like the Thunderbolt</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003E3HPD0" id="B003E3HPD0-review19" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-31:</strong> This cable when plugged into Samsung Galaxy S3 while being held portrait orientation goes toward the left, which for me is perfect because my A/C USB charger is located at the left side of my desk.

My OEM battery is a few years old and cannot hold a decent charge any longer.

I was hoping to find the best possible battery (OEM size) that would be a direct replacement.This battery is 2250 MaH and The OEM is 2100 MaH.This RAVpower battery dies a full 2-3 hours before my OEM battery does, with the same usage.Not a good replacement for me.*** EDIT 7/14/14 ***After leaving this review, Sunvalleytek contacted me and offered to ship me a new battery free of charge, and keep the old one as well. This new battery worked better than the original one by far. Shortly after this experience, I was drawn towards extended batteries and cases to fit them, so I have gone down that road instead. Still, this is a good battery for those people who DO NOT wish to increase their phone's thickness and weight.

Within a few days, I dropped my phone. As I desperately looked over it to make sure my screen wasn't cracked, I saw with dismay that there were a few hairline cracks on the surface that I could run my fingernail over. They kept getting bigger, and more numerous, so I took it to an Apple store to see what could be done. The guy told me the scratches were probably on the screen itself, since iPhone glass doesn't scratch. Obviously I didn't believe him (even when he tried to scratch his iPad with a key to demonstrate it wouldn't happen), but I had 2 more protectors at home and I had a bit of hope. Lo and behold, I removed the protector and my screen was absolutely fine. It has been fine since I have stopped using protectors.

Using normal in the ear bluetooth or wired headsets people would complain that they couldn't hear me clearly. Even with headsets with CrystalTalk noise reduction, it was still difficult to hear me. The Smart car is noisy on the highway and don't even mention trying to talk with the top or windows down.Then I bought a set of these.Crystal CLEAR!I even tried them before getting in the car by turning the bathroom faucet on full and putting my head in the sink close to the water stream. A strongly running faucet simulates the same frequencies as wind noise. The person on the other end couldn't even hear the faucet running and my head was in the sink.Then I tried them in the car.First with the top and windows up at 60 MPH. The other party could hear NO background noise.Then with the top down. They said that my voice was clear.Then with the top and windows down. The wind was so loud that I could barely hear myself talk in the car but they said that they could me with perfect clarity. Amazing!The noise reduction ability of this headset is the best that I've ever seen by an extremely wide margin. If you've got a noisy environment, get these. I ordered a set for my office phone which has bluetooth. I don't have noise in the office but the comfort and close proximity of the mic still makes for an excellent headset under all conditions.PROS:1. Absolutely amazing noise reduction.2. Your voice is clear and free of background wind and noise on the listener's end.3. Eight hour battery life4. Relatively inexpensive5. You can talk and charge at the same time. Most bluetooth headsets won't allow this.It does charge with a standard miniUSB although I much prefer the more common microUSB.6. Lightweight and comfortable fit and comfortable ear cushion.7. Adjustable headband.8. Easily switches to the left or right side of your head.9. These should work well on a bicycle or outside in wind.CONS:1. It uses a miniUSB instead of microUSB socket to charge. Since most phones use a microUSB, you must have an extra or dual charging tip.2. It does not have voice prompts. Many of the modern bluetooth headsets actually speak what it is doing such as power off, pairing, volume maximum, etc. This has a series of tones. It's not as good but it's ok.4. No A2DP. In other words, you can only hear phone conversations. You cannot play ANY other audio from your phone. No music, no audiobooks, no anything but a phone conversation.5. Bright blue LED blinks three times rapidly every seven seconds while the unit is on. Although this lets you know the unit is on, it is rather bright and distracting, especially at night.6. Volume in the headset is average. You will most likely keep it at full volume. It's not very loud but loud enough.7. Construction feels non-heavy duty but they are lightweight. The headset does feel like it will last barring any rough physical abuse. If it lasts a year or more, I will be very happy for the price.The cons are relatively minor compared to the super benefit of being able to be understood clearly in a windstorm.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004GJ4OQW" id="B004GJ4OQW-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-05:</strong> I love this headset, err, i should rather say my GF loves it.

My one complaint would be the design of the head rest that is on the opposite side of the earpiece (hence only 4 stars).

Their batteries are a bit pricey, but the price is absolutely worth it. The replacement batteries were just as good as the Samsung battery that my phone comes with. One part of this product that should be better advertised is the full NFC functionality. I had bought some off brand batteries for my Galaxy S3 earlier this year (without NFC capability). They were sold in a pack of 3 batteries with the external charger for $15. These batteries quickly degraded and now 6 months later here I am buying more. Overall, I am very happy with the product and I highly recommend this product to others.

For not only did they send me an redesigned charger, but they gave me two additional batteries in an combo set I never ask them for in the first place!.

The batteries were wrapped very neatly in plastic wrap, the charger was enclosed in a nice little box, everything including the usb cable was packed neatly in another outer box. All these nice little touches for an item worth $20.The batteries works fine. Good to have spares around when you need them. However, like most reviewers have mentioned, the charger took a while to charge a battery. A nice thing to have - if the charger had pins to be plugged into the wall instead of just through usb charging. Batteries do not have NFC, so S Beam will not work with these batteries.Overall, I think they are a great value for money and the quality of the products are pretty good.

It isn't water because it pooled on the water sensing sticker and didn't change the color. Also the case and exterior were bone dry as was the interior when I put the battery in. There was liquid on top of and underneath the battery.I have a hard case over the back so all I can guess is that it would have bulged as other reviews on here talk about, but instead the pressure holding the back of the case in forced the liquid out. Miraculously the phone still works. The funny thing is that the case popped off a couple of times, and I think that was due to swelling.

Comes with a wall charger for the two batteries which charges at 0.5 watts but charges in about 4 hours so between the two, you could run the phone full tilt on battery indefinitely. Loses a star as the battery falls off drastically below 30% (your lucky to get 1 hour) and is simply not as long running as a factory battery. I'm perfectly happy with my purchase as it is a good value, but I would have rather had just one battery that lived up to it's rated capacity.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008AGA6PK" id="B008AGA6PK-review42" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-04:</strong> The bad part about these batteries is they have a little less capacity than the ones that came with the phone.

I prefer keeping the thin and light batteries with me than carrying a charger since I can swap in a new battery faster than waiting for a full charge.

After 5 months I decided to use US Cellular's battery swap program and get a new battery.  As it turns out, US Cellular does not use new batteries in their battery swap program and I got a reconditioned battery.  The reconditioned battery did not perform as well as the original 5 month old battery that came with the phone.  These Anker 2200mAh batteries are somewhere in the middle. I was expecting better then OEM.  This battery does not perform that well.My wife and I both have GS3s so this product works well for us.  We leave the charger and spare batteries on the counter.  I used a Green Sharpie and made a mark on the front of the batteries.  I used a Red Sharpie and made a mark on the back of the battery.  After a battery is fully charged, it is removed from the charged and placed face (Green side) up.  If my battery is close to dying I will swap batteries.  If the charger is in use, I place the discharged battery face down (Red side up).  When the charger is a available, batteries with the red side up are placed in the charger to be charged.

Shipping was extremely fast and the product was well packaged. I've read a lot of the reviews of aftermarket batteries on the tech forums and Anker seems to have a good established reputation. I avoided QCell even though it has NFC because it is full of blatantly fake 5 star reviews. It may or may not be a good product but I refuse to give a seller that relies on deception even a single dollar.I haven't had the phone long so only time will tell if it will maintain its capacity for any appreciable length of time. It comes with a 1 year warranty so I guess that is time enough to tell. If it maintains its current performance and declines the way the stock battery normally would, then it is well worth the price. It makes no sense to me to purchase $30 batteries that claim a dubious additional 200mah when you can buy 3 generics that are just as good as stock for the same price.NFC is not that prevalent right now so it is a non-issue for me. Maybe once the deal between Google and the ISIS consortium goes through it will be more widespread. However, to me it makes no sense to have to unlock my phone and swipe it, enter a password, and pay rather than to just pay with my credit card. What happens if you run out of batteries? Also, it just puts your phone more at risk of being dropped it situations like drive thrus. I think by the time it gets wide spread enough, it will be time for a new battery or phone.P.S. When looking at reviews, especially for generics that come from Taiwan/China, look at the reviewers history. Often times, they will have just one or two reviews and if they do have more than 1 review, they will all have been made in a short amount of time to give their account a little more legitimacy. The verified purchase means nothing as that is easy to game by the vendor.Edit:Well, it is now April 14, 2013 and one of the batteries has died. The battery has swollen up a tiny bit in the middle. The big problem is that the phone will become unstable and shut down when indicated power level is 40-50%.I drove the battery pretty hard so I'm only going to knock out 1 star as I feel I've gotten my monies worth.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008AGA6PK" id="B008AGA6PK-review48" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-23:</strong> Anker makes a great product.

I contacted customer service and they promptly sent me a replacement. That one I believe lasted less than the first. So every time i try to use either charger its a constant toggling and angling to try to get the led to light up, and hope it stays lit and charges the battery. I also noticed that the charger was lighting up blue with empty batteries in it. I don't know why it would be doing that. It had me going for awhile, cause there I was thinking that i had a fully charged battery since the charger lit up blue, and when i put it in my phone it immediately gave me the low battery signal.The batteries however are working fine. I haven't noticed anything problematic, but it's kinda hard to get them all charged since the phone takes so long on it's own to charge, and the external chargers are not functioning.I really want to love this product, maybe i was unlucky with defective chargers twice? :(</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008AGA6PK" id="B008AGA6PK-review51" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-06:</strong> I have only had these batteries a couple of days, but did have a chance to use both of them and then recharge them.

They last a long time but that's an easy statement to make considering they are new. Generally cheap batteries will start fading after a few dozen charges. If that happens I will come back and lower the rating. I have a habit of following up on reviews, so if no edits are made then you can be assured that the batteries are holding up!Review Amendment 8/18/13: The batteries are holding up great. They last hours of constant use.Cons (Updated): I increased my rating by a star due to the amazing customer service and follow up that I have experienced upon receiving a defective charging unit. Upon my review of the poor charger quality I was contacted by an agent who took all of my feedback and immediately shipped out a replacement charger. To no fault of their own this charger has yet to make it to me. Once I receive it I will update this review. The only direction it can go is up as I value customer service more than anything else, which is why I choose amazon.All products are subject to defects so I can't fault them for my experience. It's what they did about it that counts. I feel confident in the two punch combo of service delivered by Anker as well as Amazon. Check back in a week to see if this review turns into a 5 star.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008AGA6PK" id="B008AGA6PK-review57" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-09:</strong> My wife & I both have Galaxy S3s, and so the set of 2 batteries was perfect for me, and the price was outstanding.

This product helps to make those circumstances disappear.  I've had this item for about 2 weeks now, and though I haven't had to use it often, when I have it has been great.  The batteries fit perfectly into the SIII and seem to be at least on par, if not better than the OEM battery that came with the phone.  I don't have much opportunity to use NFC, so the product's lack of that functionality does not bother me.  The charger works ok, but it only came with a USB plug and not a wall charger adapter. Luckily, I have several of those laying around from various phone/ ipod chargers.  It does seem to charge pretty slowly however.  All-in-all a smart purchase if you've ever run out of battery at an inopportune time or had to use your phone less than you'd like so that you don't run your battery dry.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008AGA6PK" id="B008AGA6PK-review62" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-10:</strong> After a few months, the batteries expanded and would not hold a full charge.

The application powers up the S3 to 100% CPU and screen to 100% brightness.  After running down the battery, it comes up with a score.  The Samsung OEM battery scored a 538 whereas the Anker 2200 mah scored a 519.  Therefore, the Anker battery in terms of performance when new is almost the same as the Samsung battery.I noticed the Anker battery seems a touch lighter in weight than the Samsung although I did not weigh the two on a scale.I came to the conclusion the Anker makes a worthwhile backup battery especially for $9.  Something to have in an emergency when the OEM battery winds down, however, I prefer the stock battery as my primary.  In one year, I will re-test both my Samsung OEM and the Anker battery on the AnTuTu tester.Update:  9/8/2012Let me clarify my review.  First, let me say that I have owned the Samsung Galaxy S 4G, the Galaxy S2 and now the Galaxy S3 and have tried different batteries.  I use my phone for both business and personal use.  The Anker battery is not a bad battery, but a good backup to the OEM battery.  I do own an Anker battery and use it a few times a week when the Samsung battery runs down and there is no other solution.  The Anker battery is easily carried in a coat or pants pocket.So I do recommend getting this battery because for the Amazon price of $9 you cannot go wrong.  I think you can even buy two of these on here for an even better discount.  However, I personally would not use the Anker battery as a primary battery because it simply did not test as well as the Samsung OEM battery.  They did come close though...I would be willing to re-test both batteries again using different testing programs.  I will admit that one test using one benchmark program is not really a fair test.  3 tests using at least 2 different programs and averaging the results would probably be fairer.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008AGA6PK" id="B008AGA6PK-review64" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-23:</strong> I am very happy with this product.

My only real complain is about the charger.  I thought you can plug it into a wall, then run the USB off of it and plug that into the phone, therefore charging 2 batteries at once.  I was wrong.  Instead, you place the spare battery in it's charger, then plug the charger into the micro USB side, like you're charging your phone, so you can't charge your phone as well.  You'll need a second USB cord and wall plug.****UPDATE 11/26/13****Batteries are still going strong.  Anker saw this review on here and contacted me about the charger I received. Apparently, I was sent an older model originally.  They sent me the new model (that was pictured when I purchased this) at no charge at all and it is great.  It's exactly what I was looking for.  It plugs directly into the wall, then you can plug your USB cord into it, and are able to charge your phone and a spare battery.

They don't last long, and the Charger was a very poor quality, alot more difficult then it needed to be.2) Chinese batteries don't last long at all.These Anker batteries gave me the same, if not more battery life then my stock GS3 battery.Really slim so they dont get in your way.You can rotate them in and out at night, and they charge in about 2-3 hours.Overall, they are the best aftermarket batteries I've tired, will definetly get them if they come out with an S4 verison, when I decide to update my phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008AGA6PK" id="B008AGA6PK-review93" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-15:</strong> I bought these batteries less than a month ago based on the reviews, and both are totally dead.

But a mistake was made by me and I am attempting to correct it.  I need to remove a bad remark I made about this seller concerning these batteries.  I am having trouble finding the place to go to &#34;remove seller feedback&#34; so I can correct my error.  I was meaning to review about some Samsung replacement batteries I got the week before I ordered these Anker products to replace those I bought from the Samsung replacement.  These batteries and the seller are excellent. Since I purchased these I have also bought more of them for this and another phone, bought 3 external battery chargers, three car chargers a phone cover and a few other items.  I in no way meant for the bad review to be about this company or these products.  I'm not the quickest person on a computer and I made a terrible mistake by writing the review on the wrong order, product and seller.  So I'm trying to make it right.  These are great and the seller is too.  I will be contacting Amazon as soon as possible to find out where the link is to remove a seller feedback.  I cannot find it right now but I don't want anyone to think these are bad, they are good.  I made a very bad keyboard error and I apoligize.  So now I have embarrassed myself and everyone knows I'm not so quick on a computer.  Please disregard any bad review I published here and believe me that  it was not this product that was bad, but a different one.  I feel just terrible and will continue to attempt to find the correct link to fix this.  I apoligize.  Monica Cochran.  Sorry to the Anker Company.  I really just made a computer mistake, I'm sorry it reflected on you and your product.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008AGA6PK" id="B008AGA6PK-review96" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-01:</strong> When I first ordered this product based on reviews of great service and product, it came in fast and I was excited to used it.  Well when I charged one of the battery fully and used it, about an hour or so into it...it got really hot.  I thought it would explode on me but it got so hot that I guess sucks up the battery from the heat so battery died afterwards. Glad no harm was done. My original battery would have lasted me the whole day since it use it quite often throughout the day.  So based on my first attempt of this product and the result it's not worth it so totally returned it and waiting on refund. I guess it was my bad luck.UPDATE:So i originally gave my first attempt 1 star.  However, because of my review, the ANKER people were so on top of things, got a hold of me, apologize, and offered me my full refund AND also a second attempt of trying out the product.  Now, you don't have that kind of service everyday.  They went above and beyond in contacting me and keeping me updated as to what they can do to give me great service! I really appreciate that kind of service so I gave it another try on the product and it works great...just as great as my original battery..actually better since my original battery slowly dying. My guess was I just had a horrible timing and happens to get the defected product by accident.  So overall, I'm very happy with the new product and I'm still using it.  So if you value great service like I do, then I totally encourage you to order from this company.  I have read a lot of reviews and done my research on products and this ANKER product is pretty good compare to others. Hope this helps =).  I would give them 5 stars but b/c of my original attempt, I have to subtract one.  So 2nd attempt..SUCCESS!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008AGA6PK" id="B008AGA6PK-review97" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-26:</strong> 2 batteries and a charger for this price = win.  Includes NFC so no loss of abilities, plus seems to last a little better than stock as the 2200mAh vs 2100mAh stock would imply.  Only possible issue is you need to be careful inserting the batter the right way (bottom first) and not force it.  I had to take mine apart to re-seat the charging connectors when I forgot the proper procedure and inserted top first.

I have been dissapointed by a lot of the cheap batteries out ther that claim to give you more mah and provide a "better than oem" solution. So I went ahead and took a chance on this set and after about a week I can tell you that I am extremely happy that I purchased this brand over the "others", because it comes with a charger too that is very nice to charge a spare while you have one in your phone and it actually works!!  :)  I also called tech support cause the charger seemed to be defective cause it was not turning blue after hours of it being on the charger... btw, blue means fully charged... I called their 800 number and got to a rep quickly who asked me a few questions and I found out that I was actually using the wrong power brick with the charger which will cause a slower charge so I changed out the brick and it is now charging batteries in a timely fashion! The batteries last at least as long as the oem batteries do except they do NOT have the NFC functionality that I use from time to time but what can you really expect from a set of batteries at this price point plus with multiple batteries you can make sure that you always have your Samsung NFC battery handy and fully charged for the times that you will be using NFC... The charger that it comes with is fairly cheap and lightweight so it will move around on your desk unless you use double sided tape like I did and that cured that problem but the charger was just a bonus so I am not complaining at all!! To wrap up this review I will say that if you are in the market for some good reliable spare batteries than don't pass this set up! And they actually pick up their phones and you can understand what they are saying...BRAVO!

The batteries work great for the short time that I have used them. The lights are the charger are wonderful to see when a battery is fully charged. The charger is compatible with the batteries that came in the package, with the factory phone battery and an extended battery that I also purchased from Anker. The charger stays plugged into the wall and the batteries are easy to install and remove. The batteries fit snugly so that they do not fall out while charging. Even the extended 4400mah battery that I purchased fits well. Now I will never be without fully charged spare batteries while traveling.Update, after several months of use and recharging, I am finding that the batteries begin to expand and do not fit well into the phone/case any longer. I also have trouble getting the back to snap onto my phone to close. The batteries still seem to hold a full charge although they may drain a bit faster than OEM batteries.

My phone had been in constant use since i changed it. I used GPS twice, several phone calls. a hell of a lot of texting. and even more web surfing. not to mention twice i was in very large buildings. so probably not the best signal. my oem battery wouldnt have faired any bettter for the aammount of use i put it through today.I just placed the 2nd battery in my phone. also chaged to 100%. ive read other batteries dont fully charge. so no stars taken away. bonus. the charger seems decent. the prongs dont look like they will break.  so two well made batteries plus a charger for $20? 5 stars in my book,,,Not sure if i really needed new batteries but all the sudden my original seemed to have a odd issue. It would be pluggedin charging but if i was using it the % of battery would still drop. In fact i kept using it till it got to 1% . still plugged in charging. the screen started to flicker it was so weak and the phone died. I decided time for new batteries.If anyone knows why a battery would still die while its plugged in and being used feel free to leave a comment. other then the obvious. its just shot.  how ever my old battery will fully charge to 100% if i dont use it and it still lasts just as long. so not sure whats going on with it.But very happy with these new ones. if anything changes i will of course change my rating</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008AGA6PK" id="B008AGA6PK-review118" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-04:</strong> seems like just another battery.. nothing special... charger serves its purpose, for the price batteris and charger are not bad if you need a spare readily available</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008AGA6PK" id="B008AGA6PK-review119" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-06:</strong> I was pretty nervous when I purchased this, since I wasn't sure if the batteries would work, how well the back-up charger would work, etc. (I read the reviews, but I still felt like I could just get the short end of the stick or something w/ my order)First impression: I opened my package, and the box was a nice box.  I somehow found that reassuring, and well, the product worked just as good as it looked in the box.I was able to charge up a spare battery pretty quickly, take that out a few hours later, and charge the other spare.  I then tested to see if my phone would also charge at a good rate, and I felt like it did.  Right after I got this product, I went to work a 2-day convention for work, and man, those spare charged batteries were AWESOME.In terms of battery life, they were at least on par with my original Samsung one, if not better.  I could actually charge up all of the spares, carry them around with me in my bag, and when the battery in my phone died, just pop in a charged spare, and keep going.  They seem to hold their charge pretty well, which means that even if I don't have the spare battery CHARGER on me, I could still keep my phone on and running.I basically ran on charged spare batteries for 80% of that crazy 2-day work event, and I did not experience a single glitch.I've noticed that even if I had charged a spare battery a while ago, that if I pop it into my phone, it's still got most of the juices there.TL;DR, I do not have a single regret about buying this product, except maybe it'd be more awesome if it could charge both spares at the same time, haha.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008AGA6PK" id="B008AGA6PK-review120" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-24:</strong> These batteries are great for emergency use only.

I had no problems with the "fit" of my case.  The only problem with these 'slip-on' cases is that the side of the case lacks strength.  The sides are too flexible and thus it's very easy to grab the phone only to twist the side of the case.I don't agree that this case is 'slippery' ... the rubberized back help to keep the phone stable and was fine for normal usage.I didn't have any issues with the camera.Since I chose the white case, it does pick up dirt/grime a bit more easily than other colors.  I had no trouble cleaning it however.This case does add a slight amount of weight but it's nothing to worry about.  I'm keeping this for a backup as I've already upgraded to a Spigen case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008YRIWWE" id="B008YRIWWE-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-22:</strong> This case is okay. Its light and functional.  The material is certainly grippy, but I didn't particularly care for the feel.  The biggest  weakness is that the fit, while okay, is not as good as with other cases I've tried (including STM's other iPhone 5 case).  In particular, the bottom seems particularly loose.  The case does have an open bottom which will allow it to be used with 3rd party Lightning cables.  But overall, there are better cases out there at a similar price point.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008YRIWWE" id="B008YRIWWE-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-06:</strong> I purchased this case in grey to protect my black iPhone 5, mainly because the Otterbox I bought at the AT&T; store seemed overly clunky for the slim new iPhone.  I was also bothered by what I sensed was less than ideal feel for the iPhone's screen with the Otterbox's built-in screen protector.I decided to try out this slim STM case and apply an anti-glare screen protector, as I had done with my old iPhone 4 coupled with a really elegant case + holster from Case-Mate.The STM case isn't quite as elegant as the iPhone 4's old Case-Mate cover, but it's not a bad cover.  It goes on tight... so tight that it lifted the bottom part of the screen cover I had just installed and created a few unsightly perma-bubbles at the bottom of the screen.One other slight annoyance is that although the cover fits like a glove, the cover's lower front portion is a little bit loose, and doesn't provide quite as much protection to the iPhone's lower screen edge.On the positive side, the STM cover is comfortable to hold and offers a reasonably good grip.  All of the ports and buttons are easy to access and control with perfectly shaped cut-outs, and the slight raised edge of the cover nicely protects both the iPhone's front glass edges as well as the screen itself.  And most important, it's slim design really shows off the new iPhone's slim dimensions and style.Given the limited alternative cases available when I purchased the iPhone on the day after the initial launch, the STM Case was a pretty good choice.  When I see a more elegant case introduced in the next few months I'll probably buy one, but in the meantime the STM case isn't a bad alternative.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008YRIWWE" id="B008YRIWWE-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-14:</strong> I bought this case b/c it is very thin and I like the thinness of the iPhone 5 so I wanted to keep it that way, not all bulky from an otter box. Well, this case does the job. I also like the color grey so that's another reason why I bought it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008YRIWWE" id="B008YRIWWE-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-14:</strong> First of all, it's a hard plastic.  No grip to it.  I say this only because that was a huge buying point and for some reason I thought it was rubber or had a texture that gave it grip.  It doesn't.Second of all, when taking photos it causes ghosting in your photos.  I read this about white cases and didn't believe it but it's true.  The hole that exposes the camera and flash is white.  When you take a photo the flash reflects off the white casing and causes ghosting.  I ended up having to take a black sharpie and coloring in the inner ring of the casing which seemed to have fixed the problem.Third of all, it does tend to push up any screen protector you have installed on the glass.  Has a great bumper which allows you to place the phone face down but unfortunately the bumper does tend to push your screen protector up causing bubbling and eventually dust under the bubbling.I would not recommend this case unless these issues don't bother you.  It's not worth the $16.  You can get cheaper cases that work just as well if not better.  I already sharpied my case to fix the issue so not able to return this one.  Oh well.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008YRIWWE" id="B008YRIWWE-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-09-21:</strong> So with all this talk about the black iPhone 5 and it getting scuffed so easily (google "scuffgate"), I decided to be proactive about my new device and get this case. I'm glad I did!The case is reasonably easy to insert my brand new iPhone 5 into, though I did pull on the material to get my iPhone in there with the least amount of force possible. Once in there, it fits like a glove, and feels very solid. You never know with cases that are on the market before the device is, as all the manufacturers have to work with are the dimensions. Without physically having the device, that can sometimes not work out too well.Thankfully this is not the case (pun intended). This case really fits nicely, and is quite solid. It's very reminiscent of the Speck PixelSkin HD, so if you liked that case on your iPhone 4/4S (as I did), you'll feel right at home with this.Thanks for the great case, STM!5 out of 5!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B008YRIWWE', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B008YRIWWE', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B003SHR7Y4</h2>    <p class="price"> $B003SHR7Y4</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003SHR7Y4" id="B003SHR7Y4-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-06:</strong> &#1588;&#1603;&#1604;&#1607;&#1575; &#1605;&#1606;&#1575;&#1587;&#1576; , &#1608;&#1607;&#1610; &#1605;&#1606;&#1575;&#1587;&#1576;&#1607; &#1604;&#1604;&#1575;&#1610;&#1601;&#1608;&#1606; , &#1608;&#1603;&#1575;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1587;&#1593;&#1585; &#1585;&#1575;&#1574;&#1593; &#1580;&#1583;&#1575; &#1588;&#1603;&#1585;&#1575; &#1580;&#1586;&#1610;&#1604;&#1575; , &#1608;&#1608;&#1589;&#1604;&#1578; &#1576;&#1581;&#1575;&#1604;&#1577; &#1605;&#1605;&#1578;&#1575;&#1586;&#1577; &#1580;&#1583;&#1575; , &#1587;&#1571;&#1593;&#1608;&#1583; &#1604;&#1604;&#1588;&#1585;&#1575;&#1569; &#1605;&#1585;&#1577; &#1571;&#1582;&#1585;&#1609; &#1605;&#1606; &#1607;&#1584;&#1575; &#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1575;&#1574;&#1593;</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003SHR7Y4" id="B003SHR7Y4-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-06:</strong> I ordered the Premium Bling Luxurious Design Diamont Crystal Case and did not get that.

She loves the colors, loves the sparkle, and loves the great big bling hearts on back.  I can say I really didn't think much of this case when I ordered it, not being one to love bling on my phone. But with the stones on it, it actually helps improve her grip on the phone because it has texture and prevents it from falling out of her hands as easily as some of the smooth cases.  It fits the phone well and has held up fairly well. The stones are large and easy to spot when they fall off so a dab of krazy glues easily holds them back in place. The case was very reasonably priced especially when you consider the cost at larger retail stores and it arrived quickly. She loves it, the iPhone is still in one piece, and it didn't cost much to make us all happy.

I had this case for about 1 year and hadn't had any major problems with it. I even dropped my phone a couple times (not from a high fall), but the raised edges did a good job in protecting it. After 1 year though, the front piece stopped hooking onto the case so the case became useless. The nooks holding the case together should be higher quality, but you get what you pay for I guess.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005YFE8AY" id="B005YFE8AY-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-25:</strong> My sister love these as a gift fits great looks great and looks like it will do the job.

It fit and looked nice.  I went to the eye doctor with my 4 year old.  He's sitting in the waiting room with me playing on it. I turned and my elbow bumped his hands.  Phone fell LESS THAN A FOOT off the floor and landed on its back.  The case was perfectly fine....but the back of my phone cracked from one side to the other.  I've since bought a replacement back for the phone....but I threw away the case.  Absolutely worthless. Besides, it was a pain in the butt to take off.

It has the rounded corners to match the glass on the display.  The color is not as depicted in the image, rather it is a light, almost canary yellow. It certainly does not match the neon yellow color of the Lumia 1520. My own personal preference is to use a matte finish over the whole case, rather than mix in the glossy finish. I think the glossy gives it a cheap look and feel. That is only a personal preference, though.The real disappointment with this case is the discoloration that occurs within a few weeks use. All four corners, and the bottom half of the case near the microphone cut-out have taken on an ugly, bluish tint where either skin oils have discolored the product, or the color is simply wearing away.  I have posted pictures to illustrate this. I can imagine that the discoloration will only get worse over time.Cannot recommend this product. Two stars for the great fit, but otherwise save your money for a better quality case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00E6BU9O6" id="B00E6BU9O6-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-21:</strong> I like this case, but the color is misleading.

That would have been a BIG mistake. Case fits on easily and adds very little bulk to the phone. The low bulk is big for me, I want a phone and case that will fit easily in a pants pocket. I have dropped the phone (by accident) and it has survived with no damage. The falls have been from various heights and edges. Note this does not protect the screen, but the 1020 has Gorilla Glass 3 so it should be fairly protected.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00E6BU9O6" id="B00E6BU9O6-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-15:</strong> I've already uploaded several photos to show some elements of the case that I think would benefit a lot of potential buyers, so here are my thoughts in words.Overall, I do like this case since unlike my last one, its not completely the slick (literally) TPU material. I can actually hold the phone now without it slipping in my hand. Love how all the buttons are easily accessible and they don't impact usage at all, or minimally for the camera button, which even without a case on the phone is terrible anyway. It also completely wraps the phone unlike snap on cases and allows you to lay the phone on its screen without worrying about it touching the surface. The microUSB port cutout is well done and the mic next to the speaker isn't blocked, nor is the mic at the top of the phone. The headphone cutout is only good enough for slim style headphone jacks, so if your headphones have a fat plastic area after the pin, it's not going to work unless you get a Dremel to make a mod. It never ceases to amaze me how nobody can get that part of the case right.My only gripe with the case is how the area around the camera hump was designed. It DOES NOT protect the edges of the camera hump at all. I was really hoping this case would provide 1 mm more of clearance around it but like every other case, except for the Amzer which supposedly covers the camera (although some images show it doesn't).Again, see my images to get a better look at the case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00E6BU9O6" id="B00E6BU9O6-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-16:</strong> First off, I put my phone in my pocket all the time. This case doesn't add substantial bulk to the phone. I can get this in and out of my jeans pocket without a ton of problem.The buttons are nicely molded. I've had some rubberized covers where the buttons weren't exactly molded right (too big, off center, etc.) This case does a great job of matching the volume, power and camera buttons up on the phone. It's almost as if using the actual buttons on the phone!I like that the color is close to the color of the 'cobalt' theme. Almost like I intended it that way!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00E6BU9O6" id="B00E6BU9O6-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-01:</strong> This case is a perfect fit.

Of course the screen is still exposed, but the edge is covered by the lip of the case. The rear of the case is raised just enough to provide some separation between the camera and a surface upon which the phone may rest.I am not a huge fan of the &#34;dots&#34; styling. That is a personal preference.

It is not a &#34;forget it's there&#34; case, so if you like the bold lines all over the back, buy with confidence.

The case overlaps the glass in varying degrees.  In some places it hits the edges of the screen protector and lifts it up.  For that I give it 1 star.  The screen protector was ruined and I will have to replace it.  The edges were torn up enough that it will not lay down flat anymore.  The case is fairly soft but not so soft that the sharp edges on the case won't mess up the screen protector.If you aren't using a screen protector it is probably a good case for the price.  It does actually fit pretty good and is nice to grip.  For that I added a star.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00E6BU9O6" id="B00E6BU9O6-review25" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-30:</strong> I love it, it is so slim, the phone looks like if it does not have a protective case, the only thing is that it keeps fighting with the protective shield...</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00E6BU9O6" id="B00E6BU9O6-review26" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-14:</strong> It fits well.

This case is exactly what I expected and really wanted to love it. Unfortunately, this is the first TPU case that has damaged my invisibleSHIELD. I have never, NEVER had a TPU case cause any damage to my screen protection. The case has no other faults, it is in fact so perfect in it's cut that it doesn't allow for any give. Corners, edges, camera, everything is protected regardless of how you lay the phone down.As a result, I have mixed feelings about this case. If I hadn't spent the money for a screen protector I'd be very happy, but sadly I don't want to throw that money away just to use this case. I cannot recommend this case if you plan on using a screen protector. However, if you are not the type to use a screen protector, this is a fantastic case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00E6BU9O6" id="B00E6BU9O6-review28" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-19:</strong> This is the type of bumper that has excellent protection from scratches and daily wear.Bumpers do not protect from drops!Note:If you have a screen protector, be sure it's case friendly.

It resulted in bulkier devices with a built-in screen protector that trapped dust and condensation under it so it was unreadable anyway. Times are changing and phones are getting larger. The phones that are made of polycarbonate such as the Lumia line which if dropped on a wooden or linoleum floor, will likely damage the floor and not the phone! if dropped on concrete or asphalt, it will dent a corner or scratch the finish. So I don't want my phone any larger than what it already is and this case fits the bill to a tee. I can still slide it into my back pocket and not notice any size difference. Another great feature of this case is that it adds grip. The 1520 has very slim edges and when picked up, it's very easy to hit the buttons on the side, the case has slightly raised buttons that still depress easily but not unless you are trying to. It makes it much easier to hold. The snug fit seals nicely around the openings and keeps the fine dust and dirt from getting between the case and the phone's body. I had that problem with my previous Lumia. After a couple months, I removed the case just to clean it up with hot, soapy water and to my disappointment found that the dirt that got in the case absolutely dulled the glossy white finish on my 920.I only wish it had more color options, I would love to se a red one!For the price, this case is a great solution. Two thumbs up!!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00E6BU9O6" id="B00E6BU9O6-review30" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-18:</strong> Major disappointment.

If there are any cases that are stamped or cut every-so-slightly askew, it has a tendency to rub (and then lift up) any screen protector in place.

It stops from scrapes but won&#8217;t protect my phone very much from a drop. Compared to other is does not add extra size or weight and isn&#8217;t hard to hold with a matted back and holes for grip unless your hands are semi wet ( aka raining or moving your phone after doing dishes) but I do recommended having the phone out in the rain&#8230;As far as the button cut outs placement and feel they all work very well I have no issue when I push my buttons and the plug charging holes is prefect. The mic hole is a little large but it is a small pic up on the bottom.  There is a back hole cut out for the rear speaker! All and all I am happy with this case the purple color is not over powering for  me (I am a guy) I didn&#8217;t want another blue case and black looks plain and is hard to find in the house. I did not want over bright colors but something I could spot when I needed to. The deep purple is very rich in color unlike a lot of other cases I&#8217;ve ordered over the last month (that were sent back) due to not matching the pictures or description. I am very happy with this case and it&#8217;s worth the 11 dollars paid for the return on the investment I will get protecting my phone. Again many Lumia 1520 cases don&#8217;t actually fit the phone or make a big phone even thicker and larger or heavier and when holding this bad boy for 10 mins the less added weight the better!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00E6BU9O6', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00E6BU9O6', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B006N1WN50</h2>    <p class="price"> $B006N1WN50</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006N1WN50" id="B006N1WN50-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-10:</strong> the shipping was processed very quick, and the product was just like how it was described. eventho I only had it on for about a week, because it was stretching so much</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006N1WN50" id="B006N1WN50-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-15:</strong> I had bought this screen protector for my phone and its a pretty great cover so far. Only been on for a few days. The application was pretty easy just be careful with the spray near your device. But even though it comes with a tool that helps push out the air bubbles which works great, the screen stayed a little fuzzy even after it had dried. It is less fuzzy in some areas now just has a few spots where it is still fuzzy. If it stays unscratched like it has so far, then I'll deal with the slight fuzziness. I can still see everything just fine. Great screen protector. Much better than the cheap ones that you just stick on! The plus with this one: 1. If you mess up the first time, you can pull it off and start over, and 2. All the corners of it actually stick to the screen unlike many of the cheaper ones!

I've found I must use a lot of the included liquid so the shield will slide though.After application the shield won't look very good until it dries completely, about 12 to 24 hours.

I love it. The difference is that it is clearer and thinner plus my screen sensitivity seems to be slightly improved. I had it at 4-stars and it is absolutely at 5-stars. Super clear and worth the money. I still have one small piece of dirt under it, but compared to a bare screen that is exposed to the elements.... there is no comparison. Definitely will be buying one for my wife as the one I had for her is not nearly as clear although it does work well.ORIGINAL POST: Unfortunately my Steinheil Ultra Crystal was no longer available on Amazon for my S2 Skyrocket.... so I had to pick something else. After looking around I chose this one and overall I am happy. Somehow I always manage to get a small piece of dirt under it. Once I get some time under my belt with it and if it holds up better... then I'll go 5-stars. The time to beat is 9-months.

It does a wonderful job of protecting the tablet without adding too much bulk to the sexy lines of the Sony.  All the port openings are where they should be and of adequate size.  A couple people have mentioned that the case holds the tablet &#34;upside down&#34;.  Since the orientation of the display flips.

Be sure to line up the sides correctly so you can charge the tablet while it's in the case.  Holes are made for each port.The case has a MAGNETIC screen on/off feature so that each time you open the case (and your tablet is turned on) your screen will automatically go on!  Close the case and the screen goes off!  Team this up with the tablet feature to auto turn the WiFi off/on when not in use and the battery will last many days!!There's also a hand strap in the back so you can safely hold the tablet in your hand without doing that balance act we all do.  And there's a stylus holder.All of this for under twenty dollars!!!You cannot go wrong!!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00B4D0COG', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00B4D0COG', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00ESL71RW</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00ESL71RW</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00ESL71RW" id="B00ESL71RW-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-10:</strong> The little pieces that hold the phone on did tend to fall off all the time but nothing a little super glue could't fix! :-) I was concearned that my Galaxy Note 3 wouldn't fit because of how big it is but it fits great.

First, the Trident Kraken is a *really* bulky phone cover.  It comes in 3 pieces and claims you can use the pieces 3 ways:  the rubber cover alone,  just the the front with the rubber cover, or all 3 together.  I don't see how this is possible since the front cover only stays put when you secure it down with the back cover.  Also, the bulky cover makes it impossible to use any charger other than the apple OEM cable.  I own a few other brands of apple chargers and none of them will fit with the Kraken.  The bulkiness can be a problem if you are trying to touch the screen adjacent to the sides of the case - your finger may not easily come in contact with whatever you are trying to tap.  Second, the Kraken case comes apart when I drop it.  The front plate separates from the back plate every time.  Maybe this &#34;transfer of energy&#34; saves my case from getting damaged, but it is annoying that this happens.  Third, the kickstand in the back is awesome when I need to prop my phone up to watch a movie, but is annoying otherwise.  When I'm trying it put it in my purse or pocket, the kickstand will flip out and catch on things.  And if you have your phone on vibrate for those quiet moments, the kickstand also vibrates making the vibrating sound even louder.  The main reason for buying this case is to protect my iPhone, which it has done very well.  No damaged screen.  No internal drive errors.  So despite all of my personal issues with the Kraken, it still get 4 stars for not breaking despite being dropped and for protecting my iPhone (despite being dropped).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0060VW8EE" id="B0060VW8EE-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-15:</strong> It's no Otter Box , but it did protect my iphone from a fall. Because of this and the sturdy media stand is why I don't want to give it a totally bad review. After the one fall it pretty much broke apart on one whole side ( fall was about 3 ft. from my hand to the ground). Cheap plastic, tinny sound during calls, and your pictures get ruined while using the flash. You get what you pay for though. Like I said it did it's main job , protecting my phone , one time ...

The case seems to be tough enough. The case comes with a anti scratch film card for the back before you put the case on. Getting the case apart was kind of hard. I had to use a little screw driver to gently pull it apart. After getting the case put together, i put on some music and turned it up and down a few times. Turning it up was easy, but when it was time to turn it down a little, it didn't want to turn down. The button is stiff. Seems like you can't turn the volume down a little without it going all the way down.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0060VW8EE" id="B0060VW8EE-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-13:</strong> I purchased this case after buying several Trident cases for a few different products. I like the idea of a separate kickstand and belt clip along with the full body protection this case offered. It arrived in typical record time from Amazon and out of the package I knew this was NOT the same level of case in days past. The first thing I noticed was a bent up back device protector (since the case allows dust). Great idea but horrible execution in packaging. The next thing I noticed was the integrated screen protector was not fully attached or sealed. The belt clip reportedly could be used as a stand but would not stay open. Overall this case is NOT worth the asking price and is a huge disappointment to Trident all the way around.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0060VW8EE" id="B0060VW8EE-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-14:</strong> We checked out the reviews for the Otterbox Defender, Ballistic HC and Trident Kracken cases.  My husband chose and bought the Ballistic case first.  The rubber piece covering the silence button fell off within less than a week of gentle use.  Amazon was very nice about it and gave us a full refund.  My husband then bought this Trident case.  So far, he liked it but there are 2 areas that need improvement:  1) The hardshell case is VERY difficult to open.  It is just ironic that the instructions on how to open the case were INSIDE the nearly un-openable case so we spend over 15 minutes opening this case before getting to the instructions.  It would have been smarter to have the instructions outside the case so we can understand how to open it.  2) Unless you use the un-ergonomic iPhone 4 headphones with the slim jack, you would need the included headphone jack adapter to plug in your headphone as the case design does not have room for a standard headphone jack.  My husband did not like this extra step.My sister has the iPhone 4 Otterbox Defender case, I did not like the spongy feel of the rubber skin so we ruled out the Defender.  For those who are upgrading to the iPhone 5, I do recommend the Otterbox Denfender case for iPhone 5 though.  That rubber is harder and you do not have any headphone jack issues.Given the 3 choices  for iPhone 4, this Trident case though imperfect is the best out of the 3.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0060VW8EE" id="B0060VW8EE-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-28:</strong> This case provides good protection but charging cable will not plug in with the hard outer case on the phone.

It has the same protection as an Otterbox Defender or Griffin Survivor at half the cost. Unlike the Defender and Survivor, which have the soft rubber backing on the outside and hard plastic on the inside, the Trident AMS has the soft rubber on the inside and the hard plastic on the outside. While this design makes the case a lot more slippery than the Defender and the Survivor, it also makes it a lot tougher for drops. The case also has a kickstand, which while unique, isn't really that useful considering the tiny size of the screen doesn't really lend itself to watching videos for long periods of time. The charger port is large enough to allow even the bulkiest chargers to charge the phone, which the Defender, Survivor, and Lifeproof do not. But like any phone case, the AMS does have its downsides. Like most protective cases, the case's design is too bulky to allow most headphone phone cables to be used without the included adapter. In addition to that, the belt clip is hard to take off your belt and the volume controls often get stuck. If you're willing to spend $60-80 on a case definitely get the Lifeproof Fre, but if you're on a budget the Trident AMS case is definitely for you.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0060VW8EE" id="B0060VW8EE-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-09:</strong> Trident Case AMS-IPH4S-BK Carrying Case for Apple iPhone 4 & 4S.

Trying to line everything up and snap the hard outer case on was a pain. The built in screen protector was flimsy, so I would have had to remove it & put on another one. So I'm returning it.

I agree with the previous reviewer who noted that the material feels like "craft foam" - it's pretty soft. But it feels nice in my hands and the pouch looks nice. The pull-tab is a great feature for retrieving your phone. The pouch perfectly matches the form of the phone. The only downside is that I haven't been able to use the pouch when I have a Ringke Fusion case on my phone. I am thinking about getting a slimmer case because of this.So I'm sure you're thinking "why use the pouch AND the case?"Here's my reasoning: my pockets always seem to have gritty material (sand) in them. Whenever I put my phone (and case) in my pocket, they pick up this grit and it scratches the case and occasionally the screen (no screen protector) and the bezel (even with a skin, some parts of the bezel are exposed). I also have to remove my phone from the case every few days and blow off dust/dirt that has collected between the phone and the inside of the case. I'm hoping that the pouch will help to eliminate this. But I want to keep using a case because I want my phone to be protected when I'm using it (i.e. when it is not in the pouch in my pocket).Edit 8/30/2013: I ended up using a BoxWave Crystal Shell for the Nexus 4 in addition to this pouch. The BoxWave shell does not add very much bulk to the phone and it fits in the iGadgitz pouch (it also works great with the Sir Lancelot Holy Grail (tempered glass) screen protector).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00792VD4O" id="B00792VD4O-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-01:</strong> Feel solid and it holds the Galaxy Nexus perfectly.

The top USB port provides 5W of power, while the lower USB port provides 10W. That's enough power to charge most USB devices such as phones, tablets and other gadgets.The wall plug has the two prongs that can be folded away when not in use. When used in a wall outlet, both USB ports can charge 2 devices simultaneously with up to 15W of total power. The power pack has a built-in cigarette lighter adapter (the lower USB port) which can be removed and then used in a car. It can charge 1 USB device up to 10W. With the adapter removed, the 12V outlet in the power pack can provide 12W of power should you want to charge/use a 12V device.The power pack is slim by design, so it doesn't take up the space of an adjacent wall outlet (left/right or above). It has a quality feel to it, and the black with silver accents looks smart and professional. Monster makes some great products but they are typically more expensive than those of competitors. This power pack is no exception but for the price you do get a 2-in-1 charger that can be used separately and simultaneously at home and in a car. It provides amble power for most charging needs and its slim design makes it an easy fit in a crowded outlet.

Versatility: it's not just that you can use it indoors or in the car, the lower outlet conducts 12V and can be used with any dc adapter, which has its uses.3. You can replace the bottom USB port with a USB DC splitter which would allow you to charge even more devices simultaneously (although depending on their output you would want to plug your tablet on top.Cons:1. Difficult to remove the DC USB adapter.2. PriceConclusion: Price is really the sticking point.  It is convenient and useful, but at around $50 it's just a little steep for what you are getting.  I'd rather just buy a standalone car adapter and carry around some extra wires. I think ~$30 would be a better price-point.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008MF3Y1W" id="B008MF3Y1W-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-15:</strong> I use this charger to charge an iPad and an Android phone at the same time.

To start with, it's a true 2-in-1 charger that will allow you to charge just about any two USB devices at the same time. It has enough punch charge tablets, smartphones, MP3 players, digital cameras and more.It's truly flexible in that when you plug this PowerPack into a wall outlet or power strip, it offers two USB ports that will deliver up to 15W of power, so you can charge two devices simultaneously. Add to this, when you need true charging for when you're mobile in your car, you can easily remove its built-in cigarette lighter adapter (see the one with the round silver ring) and have a single USB port in your car that provides "up to 10W of rapid-charging power" as noted in the specs, so this gives you very flexible charging options while at home, work or when you're on the road.The plug has retractable prongs that fold away neatly when not in use, and it also offers one of the narrowest form factors that this user has seen when plugged into a wall or a power strip. Unlike many similar two-port (or even many single-port) USB chargers, the narrow design allows it to be plugged into the same space that you would use for a simple two-prong lamp... it's that narrow.TheMonster Outlets to Go USB PowerPackhas the thinnest form factor that this user has found for a two-USB charger, and that make it handy when outlet space is at a premium. Being a hybrid vehicle/wall charger makes it quite versatile, but don't leave the part that goes into the cigarette lighter in your vehicle or the versatility will be lost.10/24/2012</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008MF3Y1W" id="B008MF3Y1W-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-02:</strong> To be clear, this is a box about the size of a deck if cards. It has fold out ac prongs to plug into the wall. In that configuration it provides two usb ports for charging with a total of 5w of power. The round usb port can be pried loose from the box and it is a very small single car charger - converting your cigarette port into a usb charger.  No cables are included.Negatives - the round part can be difficult to pull out with your fingertips or nails; the ac wall prongs cause the adapter to take up most of a normal two plug wall outlet. It is possible to plug in something else above it, but only a slim lamp plug or similar.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008MF3Y1W" id="B008MF3Y1W-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-20:</strong> One of the expectations of a two port USB charger is that it will let you save space on the number of outlets used. This is unfortunately not the case with this device. The plug is placed in such a way that it isn't possible to use a nearby outlet on a powerstrip. There is some added convenience of a built in car charger (single usb), but it requires taking the charger back and forth with you.  There was also a bit of sparking on plugging this in, not much, but other chargers did not do this.  It is capable of putting out a decent amount of current, enough for larger devices.  Overall though, the convenience is hampered by the design.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008MF3Y1W" id="B008MF3Y1W-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-24:</strong> It works to charge my iPhone 4s.

The size of the full unit, although not unusually large for this type of charger, doesn't fit terribly well in his car, so having the center section pop out is fabulous.  We normally keep just that tiny part plugged in and the remainder in the glove compartment.  This is great in that it will charge two devices at once when put back together.  When both of our cells or iPads need charging at the same time, we now have that option.  I wish someone had thought of this many years ago.  It would have saved a lot of "just let me charge for a few minutes more then it can be your turns".</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B008MF3Y1W', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B008MF3Y1W', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B0094CWZ7G</h2>    <p class="price"> $B0094CWZ7G</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0094CWZ7G" id="B0094CWZ7G-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-25:</strong> as others have mentioned, the green bumper does gain flaws rather quickly, but the integrity of the case doesn't seem affected.  it's way cheaper here than at target.  the color is more yellow than green, but i'm ok with that.  it adds some level of protection without being bulky, so i think i'll be sticking with this case for a while.  the back is semi transparent, but not as much as the picture makes it seem.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0094CWZ7G" id="B0094CWZ7G-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-26:</strong> Exactly as described fits phone great.

I was OK with that case but I am happier with the Belkin Grip Candy Sheer.Both cases are relatively small, for those who want some protection but are not interested in an oversize Otterbox-style solution.  Both offer a TPU shell around the phone, while the Speck adds a hard plastic shell around the back and sides.  Though I have no interest in conducting drop testing with my iPhone 5, I suspect the Speck offers a bit more protection due to its design.  But there are three reasons I prefer the Belkin case:1. The Belkin is slightly smaller and thinner than the Speck, while from all indications still providing a moderate amount of protection to my iPhone 5.2. The glossy hard back of the Speck CandyShell is incredibly scratch-prone.  After a month of use the back of the case is really scratched up and frankly looks like crap.  The TPU back of the Belkin Grip Candy Sheer should be much more resistant to obvious scratches.3. The Belkin Grip Candy Sheer isn't "grippy" like a silicone case (which I really dislike), but does provide some resistance to sliding off a table or desk.  In comparison, the Speck will slide right off a table due to it's slick back.Now some of my issues with the Speck CandyShell may be addressed by theSpeck Products CandyShell Grip Case for iPhone 5 - Black/Slate Grey, but I'm not personally a fan of the two-tone Grip design.  For a small, simple, practical iPhone 5 case the Belkin seems like a winner.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0094CWZ7G" id="B0094CWZ7G-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-16:</strong> I love this case.

The black/green combo looks just great on my black iPhone 5, and it meets all the criteria I set for a case I would own.First, it needs to fully protect the back. A small nitpick is that the camera opening is a tad too large, but that nitpick is small. I do prefer the size of the cutout in the Speck PixelSkin HD for iPhone 5 case.Second, all the buttons must be covered. With the headphone jack relocated to the bottom with the iPhone 5, it means you can use this case/your phone in the rain, since there are no exposed gaps/holes at the top of the phone. I've used my phone in the rain many times with this case to no ill effect.Third, the cutouts for the ports/speakers are excellent, and the tapered vibrate-switch opening is excellent. I had some trouble getting my finger into that area to toggle the vibrate switch with my PixelSkin HD case because it didn't taper. With Belkin's Sheer Case, this is no longer a problem.Lastly, I like that you can put the phone face down on the table and not have the screen be touching the surface due to the raised lip.Overall, this is an extremely comfortable and stylish case. It hardly adds any bulk to the iPhone 5, but does make it easier to grip and protects all the corners and flat surfaces from damage.

It picks up most dirt that accumulates near the Belkin logo.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0094CWZ7G" id="B0094CWZ7G-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-31:</strong> I've been a long time iPhone user, but have never really wanted to get a case. I've traditionally always purchased the Zagg Invisible Shield products, and then with my later iPhones the XO Skins versions. I'm usually quite careful with my phones, and even after I've traded them in they've looked like new. Being given this case, I figured I'd give it a try. I've never had a case on my iPhone (as indicated), so this is the first case I've tried.Initial impressions were positive. It felt soft/rubbery to the touch, versus a hard molded plastic. The photo shown for the product on Amazon shows the Apple logo and iPhone brand showing up. I've personally got the black iPhone, and don't see that on my unit. Not a big deal, really, but it is something I was expecting. It might be different with a white iPhone, since that is what Belkin is showing in the photo.Putting the case on the phone wasn't a big deal at all. I just slid the phone into the case, and it molded as it should. My biggest problem with it is the difficulty of turning on/off the silent button. It's not terribly difficult if you try, but you really have to put your finger in there to successfully move the switch. I've been used to it being so readily accessible, that it will take some getting used to. It's, no doubt, the biggest downside for me, and the main reason I provided a 4 star rating.The case does seem to have ample space for connecting the lightning connector and headphone jack. I haven't experienced any issues with connecting either of those true cables. The molded volume controls into the case and power/sleep button work fine too.A couple other issues I've run into:1. I left my XO Skin screen protector on, as the Belkin product doesn't include one. I realize I should probably get a case fit XO Skin now, but when I push the volume controls I do see the XO Skin beginning to lift up on the side.2. I have the 30 pin to lightning connector from Apple to be able to get some of my accessories to work properly with the iPhone 5. That, unfortunately, does not work with this case since the hole is too small. I have to lift up the bottom of the case off to connect those accessories.All in all, I think I may actually keep a case finally on my iPhone. I like how it looks (I'm a big fan of green), it performs as I'd expect it to (although I've yet to drop my phone), and overall it works as expected. There are a few minuses that I've outlined, which probably are more issues with just cases in general. If you're looking for a case, this is a good one to look at.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0094CWZ7G" id="B0094CWZ7G-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-27:</strong> I've been carrying my iPhone 5 in a leather sleeve, so that it is bare and maximally thin when in use, but well protected in my pocket, but it's awkward using a 2 part solution and I kept my eyes out for a nice looking case. So I was happy to get this one.I like the two toned color combination. The texture is attractive, if a bit on the hard/slippery side. Openings are well beveled, and show a high degree of craftsmanship and tight tolerances. The rim around the screen is deep enough to give some protection from flat on screen falls, while still not getting in the way of finger gestures on the edge. The volume controls are a bit stiff, but serviceable, and it takes a bit of digging to get at the mute switch, but it's OK. All in all, it looks like case manufacturers know what they are doing after 6 generations of iPhones.Apple sells 2 30 pin dock connector to Lightning port adapters. While, the stubby one will not fit into this case, theApple Lightning to 30-Pin Adapterwith a short cable snaps into place with a satisfying click as the opening is just big enough.There is no actual Apple logo on the back of this case despite what the picture on this product page shows, nor are there light grey stripes at the top and bottom. Somebody's Photoshopped a superimposition of a photo of the case with an iPhone 5 to give you an idea of what the case is for at a glance.A little trivia, I saw the character Phil Dunphy on the TV show Modern Family use what appears to be this case on the "Diamonds in the Rough" episode of season 4.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0094CWZ7G" id="B0094CWZ7G-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-04:</strong> I want to protect my iPhone, but I don't want a bulky case.

I did my research ahead and found this case.  I wanted BOTH style and protection.  I have to admit those fancy smancy new aluminum cases by Spigen are sexy and a couple even have great protection, that's the only reason I didn't give this case a 5.  I however wanted a specific color, it had to be a dark back, I really like to dark see-thru though (I wanted low profile) and either orange or green on the edges to match my home screen color.  Belkin didn't have orange in this preference, but they did have green.  I bought the peach one first, it was more pink then peach, and no where near orange, so I returned it.Now to the specifics, this case feels so great in your hand, the phone won't slip out of your hand!  I feel that all my phone's edges are nicely protected from minor drops and scratches.  It has full coverage around the phone and a mini-lip in the front, so your glass screen isn't directly on your desk.  My Tech Armor HD screen protector fits fine also.  I also have a 3rd party charging USB cord that's slightly larger than the Apple cord and it fits fine with this case.  There are three cut outs on the bottom of the case, nicely protective.  Side button access and top are fine, the top isn't as clicky as without a case, but no issue using this case.  Oh also, the phone case opening fits Apple specifications that the cut out be in black to protect picture quality.Overall a great looking case, complimentary to my iPhone 5s.  I would recommend this case and I would recommend a second for fun.  For the great price on Amazon, you could have a few in different colors.

Well made. Just the right combination of protection without bulk, flexibility and snugness. Rubber like feel that feels soft to the touch and seems to provide really good shock absorbing capability (yes my iPhones go through tumultuous relationships with me so they need this level of protection). Also easy to take off and put on, without a sense of looseness or stiffness like some other cases that I have tried that used a harder plastic type material. This is important since I need to change SIM cards all the time when I travel (I travel a lot) so I need to take the phone out of its case. Wish all cases had a SIM card slot but very few do so this is as good an alternative as can expect. I even expanded (cut out) a larger port for the lightning cable since I use a lightning adapter on some of my older iPhone charger cables and this was able to accommodate that without falling apart or falling off the phone.

I have another expensive $30 one that got shelved 15 minutes after arrival because it was just too darn bulky and then I have this Belkin Grip cover which almost became my Khomo replacement but it lost out simply because it was just a tad too bulky when compared to the Khomo but it does offer better grip than the Khomo.If you want a fairly slim cover that offers reasonable protection the Belkin Candy is a good choice.  It's not bulky, it offers a nice grip feeling, is fairly easy to remove and put back on and it offers good overall protection.  If you're looking for a more robust case that can with stand a big drop I suggest another case and if you're looking for something ultra thin that mainly protects against scratches and are not the kind of person that  drops their phone I suggest the Khomo or one of the other ultra slim models.One of the reasons I bought the iPhone 5 is because it was ultra slim and sleek looking.  I see using any case that takes away from that as a negative but that's just me.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0094CWZ7G" id="B0094CWZ7G-review27" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-05:</strong> The Belkin Grip Candy Sheer took a while to come out after the iPhone 5 came out, but it was worth the wait.Unlike the very ugly, plain-jane case I found for my phone at first, the Grip Candy Sheer is an attractive, well-fitting case that gives very good access to all the buttons and looks VERY good while doing it.I tend not to drop my phone, so a slim case like this is perfect for me. It slides into my pocket and doesn't have a tendency to hang up on the cloth like thicker cases or those with cheap rubber do.The cutouts for the speakers, sync cable, mike and headphone jack are perfectly sized on the Grip Candy Sheer. The only thing I've had problems with is that the cutout for the mute switch is a little on the small size, so I can't flip the switch with my thumb. A fingertip works just fine though and it's a very small nit for such a nice case.Update (Aug. 2013):I've managed to drop my phone several times since I got this case. It's fallen from 3 feet to a hardwood floor twice and slipped off my lap to a concrete driveway once without any damage to the phone and only a slight bit of marring to the edge of the case. Although this case doesn't offer the same protection as an Otterbox, it keeps the phone slim and easy to slip into a pocket and still offers some protection against minor accidents.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0094CWZ7G" id="B0094CWZ7G-review28" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-10:</strong> The cover is just as stylish as in the picture, it really looks elegant and well made.

This is more like a soft cover with a sheer back. The cover is way overpriced for what it is and compared to the Speck cover I have, it just falls short. The Speck has a hard shell and top edges are silicone. The phone feels more secure and it is a far more superior quality cover than this. The Belkin cover fit well and the color is as described. If you're looking to just dress up your phone in pretty colors, Belkin has some great options. However, if protection is your main concern, stay clear of these.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0094CWZ7G" id="B0094CWZ7G-review30" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-27:</strong> This case in conjunction with a screen protector provides nice, light protection for the iPhone 5.  Given my activities, I prefer theOtterBox Defender Series Case for iPhone 5 - Retail Packaging - Punkand even better the Lifeproof case for iPhone 5.  However, these two bulkier cases fit my activity level which involves exposure to weather and the elements and probably more than an occasional bump or drop.  I drop my phone more times than I am willing to admit!The Belkin Grip Candy Sheer case has a nice feel to it and is a flexible silicone-like material that can probably take a shock better than the harder candy-shell types of cases.  There is a small lip on the front that secures the case and MAY (with a huge caveat) provide some protection if accidentally dropped.  This is a nice looking case with a sheer material that with the black iPhone, shows the logo and texture of the phone on the backside.If you are considering a case for your iPhone (and I always recommend one) it's wise to look at what your activities are and what your budget is.  For under $20, this is a great case that has a nice grippy feel to it.The real question is:  do you need a sandal or a boot?  You wouldn't want to wear sandals to a job that requires boots?  What are your needs?  If you are looking for an extremely light-duty case that provides LIGHT protection (including protection of the buttons much like the Apple Bumper does) than this is a case for you.  This case is "the sandal".This case reminds me of the Apple BumperBumper Case for Apple iPhone4 - Bumper with chrome buttons for volume and power - Black(sans the chrome) with a back on it.  If the bumper works for you, than this case will provide a step up in protection.  If you are clumsy or exposed to the elements in your job (construction, EMS, Fire, Police, Military, etc) I would recommend the Lifeproof for iPhone 5 or the Otterbox Defender.Aesthetically, this is a pretty case that provides SHEER and light protection.  If appearance trumps total protection for you, this is your case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0094CWZ7G" id="B0094CWZ7G-review31" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-26:</strong> This case is a great product as it is very light and whenever i drop my phone it never breaks.

The entire case is made of a soft, flexible TPU (Thermoplastic Urethane) plastic. It gives the case a modest amount of grip, and decent protection from dropping.The case includes a lip on the front of the case to prevent contact with the screen when dropped face down. The back of the case is covered with an opaque surface which hides the Apple logo. This gives the case a clean, uniform look. It has a slender profile from front to back, but the perimeter is buffered with a bumper-like surround that gives it some bulk in circumference. This is where the similarity to a bumper case comes into play. The one detriment here is due to it's additional protection, the mute switch on the side of the iPhone is deeply recessed - depending on finger size, it takes a fingernail to flip it back and forth. The upside is that it can prevent the switch from being accidentally flipped.There are no visible seams or flashing (excess plastic) from the manufacturing process. The Belkin logo is imprinted on the side of the case, which makes it not as objectionable. The back color of the case is a matte, smoky gray, with a bright green band around the sides of the case which makes it quite eye-catching.The grip is moderate due to it's matte surface and material. As with all TPU plastic cases, it offers more grip than hard plastic, but is not overly grippy like a silicon case, so it will slide easily in and out of a pocket.This a nicely made case that adds a modest amount of bulk, decent protection, ease of putting it on and an eye-catching color combination.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0094CWZ7G" id="B0094CWZ7G-review33" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-06:</strong> This is a Great phone case.

My major complaint -- and it's not a minor one -- is that you cannot use the Apple Lightning to 30-Pin Adapter with this case. The adapter needs to fit flush with the bottom of the phone for contact to be made, and the case is not cut to allow that. So, I have to remove the case when I want to use the adapter. For my wife, that's enough of a problem for her to reject a similar iPhone case completely. Me, I can work with it, but it's clearly not ideal.Like other reviewers, I haven't tried dropping my iPhone on the sidewalk to test how well this case protects against damage. As I said, though, it does make the phone feel more secure in my hand, and that's a nice improvement.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0094CWZ7G" id="B0094CWZ7G-review35" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-13:</strong> This is my favorite case so far for my iPhone 5.

Belkin seems to have really hit the mark on this Grip Candy Sheer case.  The material feels smooth (no catching on furry sweaters or fuzzy tissues), thick and substantial, but flexible and strong.  I'd say the back portion is about a dime's thickness by feel (about a mm), and the sides feel to be about 1.5 mm- so, the case is very substantial. However, it is also very sleek, adding negligible bulk or weight to the phone.  The 90 degree joints between the back, sides and the front-face lip also feel strong, and it's very unlikely that the seams would rip or fail, as some of my hard plastic cases have (shattering issues at seams).i treat my phones more carelessly than i'd like to admit, so a good case is very important to me. The design of this product is very modern and elegant, and the color of the green accent looks more sophisticated than the described "Candy--New Apple" color, imo! the Belkin logo is discretely stamped in the side, with no added color, contributing to the clean look (no cute-sy logos or pictures). The back is indeed sheer, and i can see my fingers through the smoke-ish tint with no phone in it.  The apple logo is visible, but very subtle through the back. All in all, very much worth getting this great case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0094CWZ7G" id="B0094CWZ7G-review38" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-10:</strong> Wasn't as I expected, it's a little darker than the picture but i bought it for my boyfriend and he loves it so win-win.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0094CWZ7G" id="B0094CWZ7G-review39" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-01:</strong> I've been through multiple poorly designed cases, such as the otterbox defender, otterbox commuter and the ever popular 'mercury' case. The design flaws of the OB's are glaring, impossible to miss.Defender: you DO NOT want to place hard, sharp plastic directly against the soft alloy iphone 5 case. That's a no-no.  The screen protector is also very hard and with the gap between protector and actual screen, the protector rubs against the screen potentially causing damage. Then there's the excessive bulk.Commuter: solid protection, but the design is truly embarrassing. The plastic outer shell is cut out along the sides, so the flexible silicon underneath flops out unattractively, like a muffin top. How embarrassing.The mercury case, get this, uses a PIECE OF PAPER as the 'protective backing' for it's plastic case!!!! How cheap is that?!? And there are no customized cutouts at the bottom; just one large hole. Very lazy design.---Now FINALLY, we get to a real iphone 5 case. The belkin simply feels RIGHT. It feels like a natural extension of the iphone 5.PROS:1. the black gravel color scheme is tastefully subdued, and completely compatible with the matte black iphone 5.2. there are nice covers for the power button on top and the volume buttons on the left side of the phone. The buttons underneath remain reasonably responsive as well; although understandably, they don't have quite the same level of responsiveness as if they were uncovered.3. The case fits really, really well. The bottom of the case near the cutouts is a little more flexible and sags just a bit at center bottom. Understandable, since there is less material due to the cutouts on the bottom side of the case.4. I got a little bubbling with my screen protector, more because the alignment of the screen protector is slightly off (a bit too high) rather than due to an inherent design flaw of the case itself.5. the overall design is minimalistic: the dark color, the small but useful raised lip, and custom cutouts for all buttons and ports are all incredibly tasteful, useful and iphone 5 specific.CONS:1. the button covers reduce tactile feedback a bit. I don't think it's possible to retain the original tactile feel of naked buttons however, so the demerit is very slight.2. there are no covers for any of the ports or speakers or mic. Unfortunately, these covers are often poorly executed, pressing against a plug when the ports are in use, so I only note this for those who MUST have port covers.3. the fit of the case on the bottom is not quite perfect. It's acceptable but it won't be excellent since the TPU is a flexible material and there's significantly less of it due to the cutouts.SUMMARY:Overall, 4.5 stars, rounded up to 5. Why do I round up? Well, first of all I have to given amazon's rating system. Having said that, this case represents such a vast improvement over the other 3 cases I've tried, that it warrants the benefit of the doubt.All nitpicking aside, the case as I stated earlier, FEELS like it's one with the iphone 5. It is the only case I've used so far which allows the iphone 5 to retain the appearance of an iphone 5 with the case on.I can't attest to the drop protection of this case, but suffice to say, the phone will be much better off with the case on than without. All four sides are fully protected from drops, as is the entire back and front (due to the raised lip), assuming the screen does not make contact first.If you are at all hesitant about getting this case, don't be. It is so much better than it's price point competition it would be foolish not to put it on your short list for iphone 5 cases.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0094CWZ7G" id="B0094CWZ7G-review40" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-18:</strong> I really like this case for its nice feel and adequate protection. But, unfortunately, it suffers from two flaws, one major and one minor. The minor flaw is that the ringer mute switch is too recessed in the plastic to be easily switched on and off. The major flaw is that many earphone plugs will not reach in to the socket. I tried with my Shure earphones and they simply do not fit. A redesign is called for. Otherwise, it is a very attractive case, and if you don't listen to music on headphones might well be a great option for you.

It fits my iPhone perfectly and snapped right on. It also provides decent protection - the rubber gives the iPhone a little more of a &#34;grip&#34; and on most surfaces, the phone bounces when dropped (I wouldn't recommend testing this, though.)The issue I have is that the case is UGLY. I purchased the blue/smoke thinking the blue would be a bright-ish blue and the smoke would be somewhat translucent, like the product photo. The smoke part of the case (the back) is NOT translucent at all- you can't see the apple logo through it. And the blue is super dark, like &#34;bowling shoe&#34; blue.I'm glad to have protection for my new phone, but this is a really ugly case.

The majority of people buy these huge ugly iPhone cases and screen protectors, and by the time they're done, its like they're using a smartphone from 10 years ago.  I've always been strongly against these.  However, this Belkin case is done right.  Its thick enough to save you from a decent drop, but not too thick so that it ruins the look of the phone.  Also, the back is semi-see through so you can still see the back of the phone (you can't see much with the Black iPhone, but it looks pretty cool with the White one).  They have their own buttons built into the case for power and volume, so you're buttons are no longer exposed (most cases leave your buttons stick one, which means you can still damage them).I hate iPhone cases, and this is the first iPhone case that I really like.  You may be asking- why only 4 stars?  Well, I got the "orange/black" case, and it is more like "pink/black" or "peach/black."  It's definitely not orange (looks much different from the Amazon picture).

It is made of semi-flexible plastic that makes it easy to insert and remove the iPhone.  Even though the protection is limited, it should protect the phone in most instances.  The back, all sides, and the edges of the screen are protected by a thin, rubberized plastic.  The lock and volume buttons are covered.  I like that the lip wraps around the edges of the screen to protect in from edge impact and to lift the screen, just a little, in case of face down impact.  (The Belkin View case has a slightly higher lip and therefore more screen protection, but it has scuff issues.)  Among low-profile cases, the Grip Candy Sheer offers good protection.Although the back of the case is translucent, it obscures the Apple logo except in extreme bright light.  The photo makes the back seem more transparent than it really is.  If you want to show off the logo, then you'll want a transparent back case such as theBelkin View Case.  I like the translucent back because of its visual texture.  I also like the contrasting colors that give the phone a distinctive look.  If my husband's and my phone are on the counter, I know at a glance which one is mine.  The best feature of the case is the way the phone feels in my hand.  I love the non-slip, rubberized feel of the sides.  There are two downsides, however:  1. When I insert my phone, the case pulls up a bit of my screen protector in the corner because the fit is so tight. 2. My auxiliary cable in my car won't fit in the jack cutout.  My earbud connectors fit, but anything with a slightly wider base will not.Out of the Belkin cases I own, this line is my favorite, followed by the Belkin View.  This cover would be perfect if it had a higher lip around the screen and a slightly larger cutout for the headphone jack, but even as it is, it's the best one I own.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0094CWZ7G" id="B0094CWZ7G-review46" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-05:</strong> Great case that keeps the iPhone 5s slim and light.

The "Belkin man" logo does not appear on the back and the case is not transparent like the picture. Also the orange edges are not as red as they look in the picture. This case seems pretty solid and well made. It went on the phone without issue. Also as others have mentioned the case does have buttons built in that cover the volume buttons on the phone, which also means the mute switch is inset a bit. My only complaint so far is that the edges seem kind of sharp, which makes it uncomfortable to hold. However I suspect the edges are sharp because of the manufacturing process and will smooth out after a little use.Update 11/28/12 -- I am no longer using this case. The case is solid, well made, and looks good. There is nothing inherently wrong with the design. Unfortunately, after a couple weeks of use, the case did not get any more comfortable to hold.

I highly recommend this case to anyone who wants to look cool with a good protection.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0094CWZ7G" id="B0094CWZ7G-review55" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-26:</strong> The Belkin Grip Candy Sheer case for iPhone 5 (gray/black) is a decent "budget" case. It's TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane, which is a mixture between hard plastic and soft silicone), so it's not super soft or flexible like a silicon but not hard plastic, either. The phone easily snaps in (and out) of this case. But it is smooth/soft to the touch and attractive and low-key in appearance. The "sheer" aspect is a little dubious, as I can just barely see the top and bottom lines of the phone's back, and only see the Apple logo in the right light (but that's not really a concern). It's not solid, but it is very dark and does not appear to scratch easily. As promised, it is slim and form-fitting, and has a slightly raised bevel around the face of the phone so it won't scratch if laid face-down. The button covers are also nice. They are a contrasting color and work quite well for this kind of case. I do have a little trouble getting my big fingers into the hole for the vibration switch, but that's a minor issue. The camera cutout is sufficiently large and does not interfere with photos. The cutouts for headphones and speakers are good, but the charging port cutout is square. You would not be able to use this case with a 30-pin adapter, and may have issues with 3rd-party headphones.The biggest detracting factors for me were that TPU cases DO still have some "flex" to them, so I can still pull the sides away from the phone. Over time, this would allow dirt and junk to build up. Also, while this case is lightweight and should protect from everyday dings and scratches, it likely would not offer much protection if dropped from any distance more than a foot. I believe Belkin could have addressed the flexibility issue by using a harder plastic around the perimeter of the case to add to the rigidity and protective value.That said, I can recommend this case as a solid "value" case if you just want to put something on your phone that's understated and attractive and yet still provides some basic protection. Overall I give it 3.5 stars, rounding up to 4 based on the fact that this may be all some folks want or need.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0094CWZ7G" id="B0094CWZ7G-review56" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-26:</strong> Good value.Good quality.Clear color.Only used by the original lighting cables such as Apple cable, belkin cable and Amazon cable.You can't use it with iPhone dock.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0094CWZ7G" id="B0094CWZ7G-review57" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-18:</strong> I ordered this case Orange/Black before reading all the reviews because I liked the way it looked.

It is thin, which was very important to me. It slides around a little more than a gel case, but is easy to slip into my jeans pocket.  I got the blue/grey case and can see the Apple logo on my black phone through the back of the case.  This is a great case for me now that adds very little bulk.  I will probably get the Kate Spade if it comes out in a 5 version later, but if not, expect this to last until I upgrade my phone in a couple of years. It does not have the Belkin man on the back, just their name on the side. I don't know why they changed that, but it was not important to me (either was seeing the Apple logo through the back).  I do have to pay attention when plugging in the power or headphones.  If I don't push them in harder than I am used to doing the connection is not made.  They do fit fine, just snugger than my old case did on my 4.  The camera hole is larger than it needs to be, but I don't see any problems with that.  My main reason for using a case is to give my phone protection when dropped from a few feet.  This seems to provide that as well as any gel case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0094CWZ7G" id="B0094CWZ7G-review59" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-30:</strong> It's a good case and protects well, I had just expected it to be a bit more transparent so you could at least see the Apple logo.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0094CWZ7G" id="B0094CWZ7G-review60" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-26:</strong> Smooth and good to use, protects well.

However, there are fine differences that make the Sharkk USB Car Charger stand above others.Perhaps the most important is the speed of charging. It averaged 1% per minute, so a device at 80% charge would be fully charged in 20 minutes. Impressive! Also, there are two USB ports, so convenience is a factor in this era of multiple electronic devices. Of course, a person can operate the device while it is charging without much loss of charging speed - at least for an iPhone that I tested.After removing the charger from it's easy-open box, I discovered a textured white plastic band with a square cutout also in the box. The charger itself is all white with a textured black band around most of the section visible when plugged into a vehicle's power port. I realized the white band was an alternative to the black band, which switched out easily.At first, I wasn't sure the purpose of white vs. black. But when I tried out the Sharkk USB Car Charger in my own vehicle, it became obvious. My vehicle's interior is nearly all black.  With the white band on the charger, it really stood out and would be a nice indicator to passers-by that electronic devices were inside. The black band blended the charger into the interior. Very thoughtful  addition.The dual USB ports were flexible, accommodating an Apple Lightning connector and the standard USB charging cord interchangeably. There is an icon with an arrow to the upper port indicating an iDevice. Another icon on the other side points to the lower port for such devices as BlackBerries or Android devices. However, I found no problem using either port for either devices.A -inch square divided into four smaller squares sits within the black or white band's cutout. The squares are a light gray when the charger isn't connected to a power source. When plugged into the vehicle, the squares turn a soft, light blue. Add a USB cable and connect a device, the squares turn a light salmon color. Another thoughtful consideration to let a person know if the charger is indeed making contact with the vehicle and/or with the device.So, there IS a difference in chargers and the Sharkk USB Car Charger with it's solid construction, great price and user-friendly amenities is an excellent choice.Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product to independently test in normal operation situations and provide an impartial review.

Day before yesterday I noticed the dark gray rubbery part attached to the hard plastic part (in my case, red) was pulled away from the red part on the bottom front. right in front of the charger port. within the next day and a half, it peeled all the way across the bottom and I had to remove the phone from the case because I didn't feel safe having it on there for it to get ripped off further in my purse or whatever. I have owned the case for probably 3 months or so. I won't get another and I don't intend to cash in the warrenty because I know since I bought it online and don't have a store receipt I will only get a replacement bumper. I am finished with bumpers, I'm switching to a full case. Makes the phone thicker, but the nexus isn't thick on it's own, so an extra quarter inch isn't going to make me cry.

The first one was for my 4th gen iPod Touch. They look great and are perfect for my needs. The slit at the bottom even fits my Lightning port dock alarm clock from Sony. Most cases I found couldn't accommodate the dock. This one is made to slide the bottom off for your docks but I don't even need to do that! The color is a fantastic dark metallic red and looks great with my black 5S. The paint on the case is soft touch and really solid, no chipping on either of my cases from normal day to day use. My daughter has a blue case for her iPod and it's a bit chipped I'm assuming for her dropping it a fair bit. Her iPod is still in perfect shape though so I know her case is doing it's job.I will definitely be picking up one of theses cases when they release it for the iPhone 6.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0093A5V98" id="B0093A5V98-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-31:</strong> I used to have the elago glide case, which is very similar to the GreatShield islide. The problem with the elago case was that it was so tight that you couldn't actually slide off the bottom portion of the case without enormous efforts of pulling and wiggling, which thereby defeated the purpose of having a case with a sliding dock-friendly release. Also the elago cracked in two corners within two months.This case is much better, slides well, and stands up to the occasional drop. I highly recommend it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0093A5V98" id="B0093A5V98-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-13:</strong> this is one of the best cases i have ever bought, you wont get tired of it, definitely a great case</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0093A5V98" id="B0093A5V98-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-17:</strong> When I first opened the package I thought it wasn't gonna fit right.

I had thousands of roll over minutes and hundreds expiring every month. I no longer felt I was getting any value from their service. I looked around to try and find some savings and realized that by buying my phone up front and bringing it to T-mobile, I could be saving $20 per month. The phone does pay for itself eventually.So anyway - I am supposed to be reviewing this phone. I have been curious about the WP7 phones for a while and was happy to finally make the jump. The phone itself is attractive enough and the additional software provided by Nokia makes their handsets even better than the other WP7 phones out there. The Drive GPS app is much more than I expected from preinstalled software. It has day/night mode, a good selection of voices, and speed alerts. Plus the maps are downloaded to the phone so you never have to wait for them to load.The hubs and live tiles concept takes a while to get used to, but now that I have adapted, I wondered how I lived without them. Hubs make the folders in iOS seem useless in comparison. And live tiles are like notifications that display on the individual tile. It is a very cool concept and well executed.I never thought I would use the FM radio, but the park where I go to walk has poor coverage by T-Mobile and I was not able to stream internet music there. I just switched to the radio and found an appropriate station with good reception. It worked fantastic.Also, the phone came with a pretty good pair of headphones, which don't seem to be included when purchasing from T-Mobile.There are few negative points to this phone: It is an international phone, so I was disappointed to find that the wall charger I got was the European standard and was worthless to me. However I was able to attach the cable to the USB wall plug that came with the iPhone and charge that way. Charging seems to be a little slow using USB, but I have ordered a proper wall adapter and hopefully that will remedy the slow charging.Also, the volume when listening to audio on the phone is good but not great. Although songs which have been downloaded through the Zune store sound much stronger than streaming audio.8GB of flash storage may not seem like enough to some people. My old 3GS had twice as much, but I never cam close to filling it. I am trying to force myself more and more into the cloud and having a smaller amount of storage helps that. I store my pictures on SkyDrive instead of on the phone and I use streaming services when possible to keep from having to download music to the phone itself. And I imagine that Microsoft will improve the cloud features of WP7 further as the platform continues to mature.Finally, apps. Before purchasing the phone, I had scoured the Marketplace looking for WP7 equivalents to my iPhone apps. I was not able to find everything, but in most cases I was able to find an equivalent that worked just as well. Some of the apps lack a few of the features of their iOS counterparts, but they seem to be updated on a regular basis and forum posts show a commitment to creating equal features across all platforms.So in the end, I am happy with the phone. It is not a perfect phone, but it is a huge improvement, both in the hardware and software, over my old iPhone.IMPORTANT NOTE: I became aware after using this phone for a while that it does not work with T-Mobiles 3G/4G network. I blamed T-Mobile till I realize that their high speed data requires a phone which operates at both the 1700 MHz and 2100 MHz frequencies. This phone can't use the 1700 MHz band. While the phone still does voice, text, and (very slow) 2G (EDGE, GPRS)on the T-Mobile network, you cannot take advantage of the high speed mobile data. Had I researched this in advance, I could have saved myself some money and both myself and the seller the hassle of returning the phone. I am not bad mouthing the phone or the seller at all. The frequencies it operates at are listed in the product description. I just did not do enough homework and was operating on assumptions when I made the purchase. I am sure it works in Europe and maybe even other mobile carriers in the US, but not T-Mobile. I still have this same phone, but have returned this purchase and bought one directly from T-Mobile.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00746GV06" id="B00746GV06-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-10:</strong> As far the usability goes, I have very good things to say.1) Graphics are pretty good and easy to understand.

Needs to be improved a lot.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00746GV06" id="B00746GV06-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-06-14:</strong> My smartphone history:Apple iPhoneSamsung Galaxy CaptivateNokia Lumia 710The Nokia Lumia 710 is a serious downgrade from my Samsung phone.My reasons for changing phones:1) Faster download speed.  The captivate is for the AT&T; network; I moved to T-mobile, and my internet connection speeds stayed at 2G.  Which *sucked*.2) Android crashes.  A lot.  It's a great interface, but seriously, I wish it was more stable.Other than that, the Captivate is an amazing phone.  Great music/video player.  Great contact/calendar/to do list.  A lot of apps are available for it.  And, oh yeah, the screen is AMAZING.  Blows the iPhone out of the water.  The Nokia is a dinky little toy compared to my Captivate.Why the Nokia Lumia 710 sucks and makes me want my 2G Captivate back:1) (First side note) You will need a micro SD card for this.  My Samsung had a regular SD card.  To change phones, you have to go to a T-mobile store and get a new card.  Nokia has a micro SD card in the box with this phone.  But since the SD cards are different, it makes it difficult (if not impossible) for me to go back to my beloved Captivate.  Remember this before you make the switch.2) The screen display is terrible.  In any kind of bright light, you cannot read the screen.  Forget sunlight, this thing kaputs even in decent indoor lighting.  I can't imagine anyone being happy with the display that is not living in a fluorescent light filled home or office space.3) I hate Windows 7, Steve Wozniak's endorsement notwithstanding.  I hate that the phone automatically downloads people's gmail pictures, and shows them to you in the "People" tab.  Why can't you turn that off?  What if I don't want to see these people's faces?  (Do you use your phone to call people you don't want to look at on a daily basis: i.e. anyone other than a significant other or beloved family member?  Okay.  This might suck for you too.)4) There is no swype input (which is a free option on the captivate).  That keyboard is intuitive and makes typing very quick and easy.  It is similar but not the same as what Apple has on its iPhone.5) There are not enough apps for this phone.  Android had an amazing and vibrant marketplace.  This place is the restaurant deserted at lunchtime and dinnertime.  Maybe you shouldn't eat there.  It's deserted for a reason, you know.6) No customizable ringtones.  My captivate let me customize songs and voice messages as ringtones.  They had an app called Ringdroid which was the best thing ever that let me make my own ringtones.  Windows does not want to you use song clips as ringtones, or download your own ringtones, and there are no apps to make ringtones for this operating system.  Which sucks, because the default ringtones suck.7) Pictures folder.  Stupid thing shows your pictures on the folder.  So unless you want a never-ending slideshow of pictures from your pictures folder being used as a background for the pictures icon, you can't put your pictures folder on the first page to make it easily accessible.  If you take pictures on your phone for ebay purchases, paperwork, places and people you don't necessarily want to see everyday, or anything else, beware the endless slideshow of death.  And no, you cannot select which pictures appear in the slideshow.  The phone does it for you.  It's a feature, not a bug.  Like the "People" contact list.  Ugh.8) Fingerprints.  This phone picks up fingerprints like nothing else.  It is horrible.  My beloved Captivate had a beautiful finish which resisted fingerprints and did not get dirty and smudgy easily.  This Nokia bottom of the line crapfest does not do that.9) The volume button.  You will need to use this a lot of you want to listen to the music on your phone.  It is hard to push and set in too much on the phone.  It sucks too.10) The camera button.  This is, on the other hand, protruding too much, and is easy to press by accident.  Just holding the phone in your hand normally (as you listen to music, for example), will result in a push of the camera button.  If you use your phone as an ebook reader, you can also easily push this button.11) The default search engine is BING.  It cannot be changed to a Google default.  This sucks a lot.12) The icons are weird and not easy to understand.  I had one icon sitting on my unlock screen for three months before I realized it was for the mandatory live email address that Microsoft forces you to open so you can use this phone.13) Mandatory live account to make games (called Xbox games) and music player work.  Who uses live?  Really.  This mandatory sign up sucks too.14) There are two pages.  One is the home page with list of frequently used apps you can customize into tiles.  The second page is to the right, and is *all* of your apps.  There are no other pages.  So if need to get to the bottom of your app page, it could take a lot of scrolling.  Which sucks.15) Music player.  This SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS.  It sucks so much it deserves caps lock complaints.  You cannot make playlists on the phone.  It groups videos and music together, so if you have album covers on your music, you might not be able to tell the difference between an audio file and a video file, since it does not separate them.  It creates a visible tiled history of songs/videos/radio stations you listened to, which cannot be deleted.  Which I hate.  You have to sign up for and download microsoft zune to make the music player work.  Which sucks.  I've heard rumors of an amazingly good Nokia music player, but somehow that cannot be downloaded onto this phone.16) No world clock.  There is no clock for different locations you can put on your home page.17) No world weather.  There is no weather for different locations you can put on your home page.18) Timer/Stop watch.  There is no timer or stop watch function on this device.19) Audio quality.  Audio quality for music and telephone conversations above about halfway volume (halfway between min and max) is poor and static-filled.  As a phone, good audio quality is important.  This device fails at that.20) Product advertising.  This product is advertised as an "introductory smartphone".  So if you've never had a smartphone, and are upgrading from an 1980s brick, you might be really happy with this purchase.  Personally, I find being called the equivalent of a smartphone n00b very patronizing.  If my self-esteem suffered enough, I might even be forced to pick up a "for dummies" book, so that random writers can swear at my intelligence.  If you have ever owned or used a product called a smartphone, this phone is not for you.  Even Nokia is saying that it is not for you.  Stay away.21) Google voice does not work on this phone.  So no routing calls through your google voice.  No google voice voicemail.22) No visual voicemail.23) The advertising for the Lumia series of phones has revolved around the Nokia Lumia 900, which seems to be Nokia's flagship product for this link.  *That* phone is made with kick ass gorilla glass, which you could hammer and nail and not cause a dent.  This is not that phone.  The body is cheaply made of inferior plastic, and the screen is some inferior glass as well.  It will not be safe in your pocket with your keys, or in your purse floating free.24) Bloatware. The number of pre-installed applications which suck boggle the mind.  Delete them immediately when you get this phone.  All of them will slow down this device and drain your phone's battery.All in all, I must say, I really hate this phone and regret ever buying it.  It is incredibly poorly made, and frustrating to use.But, there are some good qualities about the phone.  Here they are:1) It has a radio.2) It does not crash as much as Android.3) For me, since I was upgrading from an AT&T; compliant 2G device, this was faster.There might be other good points.  I will let you know if I ever discover them.I wish the Samsung Note was available for T-mobile.  Such an amazing device.  I wish I had that product.  Or the Samsung Galaxy III.  Even with the crashiness of Android, it is a superior device in every way.  I made such a mistake by not making a Samsung phone my next phone.  Don't you make the same mistake as well.UPDATE: FEBRUARY 2013: WINDOWS PHONES DO NOT HAVE A CALL DURATION.  IF YOU ARE AN ATTORNEY, THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM.  PLEASE ADD THIS FEATURE TO FUTURE UPDATES OF THIS PHONE.Also: This phone model is not eligible for upgrade in the operating system.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00746GV06" id="B00746GV06-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-26:</strong> This is my first windows mobile phone and I think its really nice i like the operating system and the phones hardware is a compliment.

I purchased this one because it wasn't carrier branded. It arrived on time, and was exactly as described. There is no carrier logos. The only text that appears on it is the chrome "Samsung". It matches the color of the old one almost perfectly. I suspect that the colors on this one appear a little darker and more blue because it hasn't faded like my old back cover. The color matches the blue on the front of the phone perfectly!I was wary of this item because of the price. Some of the back covers on here are either carrier branded, or a solid blue color without the metallic sheen. This fits and matches the color and texture perfectly.If you are looking for a pebble blue galaxy s3 back cover replacement without carrier branding, this is the real deal. I would highly recommend it.Update 2/5/2014:My review is down to two stars now. The cover itself seems to be original, but the "Samsung" logo is starting to come off. My original back cover took a beating. It had chips and deep scratches. However, none of the letters came off. I am literally picking at my old phone back, and the letters will not come loose. On this case however, the middle "S" in "Samsung" came off. It is absolutely immaculate. No scratches, chips or anything, but the "S" just fell off. It was even in a case for most of the time. Within a week of not using a case, the letters start coming off. This leads me to believe that this is not an original Samsung product.I am going to do my best to return this "SAM UNG" battery cover.I will upload pictures.UPDATE 4/8/2014Well I contacted the seller, and they agreed to send me one. It's been a couple of months, so I assume they just wanted to wait for the 30 day limit to run out. I am not filing a claim over $4, but it's a little annoying. All of the letters have fallen off now, leaving behind a glue residue. Other than that, it's pretty much perfect. All things considered though, anything that could go wrong did go wrong with this piece of plastic.I will upload a picture of what remains.I can only recommend this if you don't care that the back has sticky glue residue where the letters once were. This is not a Samsung battery cover. It is a knock off that uses cheap glue. At least they got the color right. So it's not a total failure.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00ACC7WOS" id="B00ACC7WOS-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-04:</strong> Well when I first order this they sent me a black one but I contacted them by email and sent them pictures in the sun of the cover on my blue phone and it clearly did not match.

Others mentioned the case making the top power button on the iPhone far too easy to press, and I had the same problem.It appears that every time the lower flap is opened and closed, the pressure slides the phone toward the top of the case.  The same is probably true of pressing the phone down onto a dock in the case.So, after a little use, the camera and mute switch would be slid to the absolute extreme edge of their respective openings in the case.  This may seem unimportant, but when you consider the same shift happening with the entire phone, you can see that the top of the phone (including the power button) was pressed too far into the top of the case.  Because of that, the slightest bump (or sometimes none at all) of the rubber power button cover would turn the phone on or off.If you're not going to be using the flip feature, I imagine the case would work fine and provide very good protection.  On the other hand, if you're not going to use the flip feature, why not just get a standard CandyShell?</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004H212RC" id="B004H212RC-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-04-16:</strong> Excellent product!,  nice materials and fit perfect on my iphone 4gs, The open rubber permit to put the device with no damage</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004H212RC" id="B004H212RC-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-04-19:</strong> K.

The latter seems to be the genuine product. Anytime we've ordered the former, it turns out to be crap. This case ion particular was poorly made and the soft silicon bagan to crumble after only a few weeks light use. I wish amazon could do something to ban these knockoffs from being sold. So just be aware and read your reviews. Real speck products are a goo value and quality, and should get good reviews.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004H212RC" id="B004H212RC-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-22:</strong> I would say that if size is not your problem with the Iphone 4/4s then this cover would be perfect. The quality of the finnish is really good and feels very elegant. On the downside as I said, it makes the phone bulky. The other complain I have is that the top lock button keeps getting pushed by the cover, so I get this &#34;Turn Off&#34; sign every now and then.

Set-up was very easy, battery life was great, and I had no difficulty typing on the keyboard.  It fit snugly on my phone, and I didn't really take issue with the thickness or weight that it added to my iPhone.  The sliding mechanism was smooth in both directions, and it didn't feel as flimsy as I expected it to.  Overall, I was impressed with it.The reason I gave this only three stars is the finish of the outer casing.  It picks up the color of absolutely any fabric with which it has prolonged contact.  In my case, that was a tan microfiber futon.  Since I work from home, the phone typically sat on the arm of the futon while I worked, cleaned, watched TV, etc.  After only about two weeks, the majority of the casing was no longer white but an ugly shade of beige.  After trying a multitude of solvents to clean it and being wholly unsuccessful, I finally opted to throw it out and just go back to using the on-screen keyboard.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008XGWC22" id="B008XGWC22-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-11:</strong> Has a somewhat cheap feel to it; but as a product it is great!

The phone easily snaps in and out of the case and fits very well.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because the case is just too heavy.  The design is EXCELLENT if it weren't for the weight.  Maybe you could design one without a battery that plugs into the phone when you put the phone in the case.

These are probably the best wireless headsets I've ever used.Here are the things I like about them:1) These are light-weight & comfortable.  Since I often wear mine for 10-12 hours a day, this is very important.2) The sound quality is excellent.  It really is like talking directly on a wired headset.3) One major problem I've had with Plantronics headsets in the past is that they aren't very good with eliminating wind noise.  Fortunately, these perform very well in this area.  I can talk just fine under a ceiling fan or walking outside by the shop with no issues.4) Having an effective wireless headset really frees me up to get stuff done while on the phone all day.5) The range is very good.  We can walk all over a 3000 square foot space without issues.  It does reach the edge of its range when we go out to the outdoor shop; but, that should probably be expected.Even though I love this headset overall, there are a few issues:1) By default, the headsets come with a cable that hooks up just fine with Polycom phones - but they don't support the answer/hang-up button on the headset.  That basically means you have to be by the phone to either answer or hang up from a call.  The best way we found to resolve this is to use thePlantronics 38439-11 EHS Cable, which is a great addition to this phone.  The downside is that it's kind of expensive for just a cable...2) There are multiple people working in a small space, and I'm regretting that everyone else has so much mobility.  I mean, come on!  It's OK for me to pace all over the office, but not everyone else. :)Overall, I would highly recommend this headset to anyone who is using an office phone and doesn't want to be tied down to their desk all day - especially if you spend a lot of time on the phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005HS5MKS" id="B005HS5MKS-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-14:</strong> Doesn't really make work more fun, b/c well....it's work. I work in a call center and get compliments on this headset all the time b/c it looks like there's a BMW on my ear. A BEEMER! So if you want the beemer of headsets, this mofo right here is just for you. Light weight, compact, etc. etc.The only negative is that the little rubber ear piece thing that you stick in your ear if you don't use the headband has the tendency to fall off quiet easily. If you lose that, you might be screwed. It fell off once and i didn't know. When I stuck my headset in my ear I stabbed my ear drum and popped it. That wasn't cool, so I have to take a star off cause now I have to use my left ear as my headset ear.  Pet peeve.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005HS5MKS" id="B005HS5MKS-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-24:</strong> I'd like to give this thing more than 3 stars, but it does leave you wanting for a better design.Let's start with its chief fault...QUESTIONABLE FIT.The headset comes with two ways to wear it.  The first is an "ear hook" with a soft insert that rests just outside your ear canal.  This option had the merit of being more secure on your head, but even with two sizes of inserts and three sizes of hooks, I couldn't find a way to wear the headset for more than an hour without having ear pain.  I'm sure satisfaction with this configuration varies from user to user, but the insert should really be more ergonomic to the human ear.  Of course, I know in jobs that mandate hearing protection, some places pay big money for custom-molded ear plugs so the workers don't have discomfort from wearing ear plugs all day.  I don't doubt the same could be done here, but at a substantially higher cost.The second option is the monophone headset.  Ultimately, this is what I used, but you can't wear it like a standard headset.  The ear pad has to rest FLAT against your ear's natural shape or it hurts after an hour or so of wearing.  So, I have this thing cocked at a 45-ish degree angle on my head so that it sits painlessly against my ear.  More so, the tension on the headset isn't that great, so don't expect it to stay on should you bend over to pick something up off the floor.  It might stay on or it might fall off.  Depends on the shape of the wearer's head.HAVING SAID ALL OF THE ABOVE, the product has worked great...so far.  For the Nortel T7316, you will need the HL10 Handset LifterB0006B088WWithout the lifter, you have to manually work the phone to start and end calls.  With the lifter, the remote answer/hang up function works from the headset.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005HS5MKS" id="B005HS5MKS-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-25:</strong> This is attached to an older Starplus STS phone.

Without it they look like a normal bluetooth earpiece with a boom mic.This PL-CS540 is the version with just the wireless headset. I suggest also getting the APV-63 (electronic hook switch adpater) instead of the HL10 handset lifter. Again, it adds to the sleekness of one-touch answer/hangup without a mechanical device lifting and lowering your handset to answer a call. There's a more expensive CS540 with HL10, but that's not what you want. The versions are the same, so the pictures of the CS540 with it's charging base are the exact same as what you get here with the PL-CS540.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005HS5MKS" id="B005HS5MKS-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-01:</strong> I would tethered to my desk without this.

A little cheap feeling.  I would like it if the seams lined up a little better between the top and bottom pieces.

I guess it is supposed to make it a little easier to access the buttons, but I think I prefer the better protection.  Overall it was a good buy with the holster.  I mainly use the holster as a sun visor clip for the phone, and occasionally use it to carry the phone while working.

However, ever since I purchased this case, I have never taken it out. Of course this case is thicker than the phone, but it still maintains a sleekness. The added protection this adds to the unit is outstanding.I have dropped the devise while it was in this case and the thud was very faint, as if it landed like a cat. The case feels like a hard plastic or rubber and has grips on the sides to increase traction in your hand.The only con is that the power button is much harder to press while this case is on. Its such a solid jacket that you have to add more force than usual to depress the button. It just takes a little getting used, and actually makes you understand how well this case protects the devise.I love this case and I do not think it should have been built any different 5/5. I hope they will start releasing more designs/colors for this same build. I would buy more.BTW: I have had this device for 3 months and have not noticed any fading of ware/tear of any sort.

My old otterbox case was stretched out and starting to fall apart. I was just beyond the one year warranty and was starting to dread shelling out another $40 plus for a new case.  In the past, I thought the $40 plus was well worth it for the case, until this case.  I am very very careful with my phone, so this case offers just the protection I need without being too thick.  I hate that the otterbox case seems waterproof, but is not waterproof.  I had the old otterbox case on my phone for so long, that I feel like i have a brand new phone with this case.  I love the grip on the side, it really does help you pull the phone out of your pocket or slide it in.  If you're on the fence and typically like the otterbox cases, and are very careful with your phone, I think you will like the change in thickness using this case for your phone.  I've had this case for about one week shy of a month.  I've gone without the screen protector and so far I've been very careful with it.  I love the clearness of the screen.

But I was impressed with the fit and finish of this case. I got both the black and the hot pink color, which I have to say the hot pink was more of a salmon color than hot pink. It's a transluscent "gel" look around the edges and on part of the back. The other part on the back is a matte kind of "powdery" finish. I like the grip texture on the sides. The camera, power and volume buttons are covered by the case, but the buttons are just as easy to press. The camera, headphone, micro usb and speaker ports are left open. There is also 2 holes on the bottom right on the back for a lanyard/charm. Overall, offers good protection and a great value.

It is slim enough to keep the thin, elegant lines of the phone yet provide good protection.  It's glossy surface has just the right amount of grip and it is quite attractive.  Camera lens protection is quite good also.  It allows you to set your phone on it's back without worrying about having the camera lens get scratched.  The one thing I don't like very much about this case is that the rubber that covers the power button is way too stiff and it takes quite a few attempts to actually get the power button to engage when the case is on the phone.  Maybe it was made that way intentionally in order to keep from mistakenly pressing the power button but for me it's too stiff and I find it annoying that I have to press the power button several times before it engages.  I suppose you could fiddle around with it to soften it up or make it more pliable but you shouldn't have to.  When all is said and done, for the price, you can't complain much.  I've used many cases that cost 3-4 times as much as this one that had more faults than this one.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008K9EJ82" id="B008K9EJ82-review28" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-05:</strong> I love this cover.

I wanted a phone with a good camera as I don't like dragging 2 devices around, so far the problems I have encountered with the camera have been user error.

Had a little charging connection problem with phone right out of box - charger wasn't 'tight' so didn't charge overnight, tried charging it with another charger and no issues.

I have froyo (2.2) which seems to have resolved a number of problems earlier versions had.One bit of advice: before you download any app or upgrade, read the customer comments. They will usually tell you better than anything else whether that particular app or upgrade is a good one. Some upgrades only install more advertising. It's also a good idea to read permissions.A lot of people have battery drain issues with this phone.

I hope that my product evaluation is objective but I should note that PowerGen provided me a free unit for review. I did not promise a good review in exchange and PowerGen did not ask for one.The 2 provided modular charging cords have a USB-A port at one end while the other end accepts any of the 6 supplied adapters: USB-B, USB-Mini, USB-Micro, Apple and two round adapters of which one I could successfully use to charge a PSP and the other fit (but did not charge) our XOOM tablet. The charger fills itself up through any AC outlet via the included AC adapter through one of the supplied modular charging cords. Output is from 2 USB-A ports through the modular cables and adapters. And the Juice Pack is not only a charger but it also comes with a one-LED light, just in case.It's true that the Pack doesn't charge 'everything' but I was able to use it with lots of devices around the house: a Blackberry Torch, a Kindle Fire, three Kindle reader models, a Sansa Clip, a Playstation Portable, a Nexus 7, an iPhone 4s. Didn't charge our XOOM tablet but that was expected because XOOM was not on the 'compatibles' list.As far as I can tell, the Amazon specs section is accurate and so are the compatibility claims at least for the devices I was able to test. On a full charge and it does take 6-8 hours to fully charge the Pack, it consumed about half of its juice to fully charge a Blackberry Torch. Whatever was left was enough to fill up a Kindle 3, a PSP, a Sansa Clip MP3 player and a Kindle Touch about one third of the way.As much as I like the Juice Pack, the product loses one star because it comes without a storage case for the 9 small accessories and there is no protective carrying case for the charger itself - there should be one for a product that's meant to travel. The odds are that some of the many accessories are going to be misplaced or lost unless the buyers provide their own storage case or box. As for the adapter, it's pretty and shiny but it needs some protection from scratches and accidental drops.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0073F92OK" id="B0073F92OK-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-07:</strong> I have bought 3 different versions of Power Gen and I love all of them.

The battery pack has a power button, a charge-in port, and two USB charge-out ports (of various outputs) to charge your devices.  On the front of the pack are 4 lights that indicate the pack's current charge level.  They light up when you tap the power button, or it's in use.  Additionally, the pack has a bright LED flashlight that is activated by double-pressing the power button.Included with the PowerGen are two USB charging cables, a wall outlet adaptor, and a variety of adaptors for different phones and electronics.I used the PowerGen to recharge an iPhone 4, an iPhone 4S, an iPod Classic, and a Flip video recorder.  It charged all of these devices quickly and without problem, and contained enough power with a full charge for four complete iPhone charges.  The two USB ports on the device allow you the charge two devices simultaneously, albeit one more slowly than the other.To charge the battery pack itself you simply plug it into the wall or your computer's USB port.  Be aware though that it draws a lot of power from the computer, and I would only recommend charging it using a laptop if the laptop is plugging into a wall outlet.The little owner's manual that comes with the device is not very helpful; since it was written by someone who's primary language is probably not English.  Still, the device is easy to figure out on it's own.All in all...a handy little power pack to keep your devices charged.(I received a complimentary sample of this product from the manufacturer to review.)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0073F92OK" id="B0073F92OK-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-07:</strong> I bought this item because my Galaxy SII started to have poor battery life after upgrading to Android 4.0. I like the Mobile Juice Pack quite a bit. It will charge my phone from less than 10% to more than 90% in less than 2 hours using the 2A port. I haven't tried to see just how many times it will charge my phone between recharging, but 2 is definitely possible on the 2A port and more than 3 with the 600 mA port. Very convenient and highly recommended. I would have liked a small case with it to keep the charger and its cords together but that is no reason to downgrade the rating.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0073F92OK" id="B0073F92OK-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-31:</strong> That little device is very nice wakes a great back up for power when AC is not available especially while flying</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0073F92OK" id="B0073F92OK-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-28:</strong> I picked this Powergen because it is almost exactly the same as the Anker Astro lll[Upgraded Version] Anker Astro2 Dual USB Output 8400mAh Backup External Battery Pack Charger with built-in Flashlight for Smart phones, Android phones, PS Vita, GoPro; iPhone 5, iPhone 4S, iPad mini; Samsung Galaxy S3, Galaxy Series Smartphones; HTC On...] but ten bucks cheaper when I purchased it.The differences between the Anker lll and the Powegen are minor, such as location of on/off button, white trim instead of bright trim, reversal of USB port locations, and style of charge indicator lights.  Other than this, the Anker and the Powergen are twins...which is a good thing.  I think Anker makes a great backup battery for either the iPad or iPhone, extending usage time considerably on the iPhone and about 50 percent for the iPad.Two things I like about the Anker better than the Powergen-the Anker came with both a long and short cable, where the Powergen only came with a long cable-the Anker came with a carrying bag and the Powegen didn'tIf prices are the same, get the Anker but if the Powergen is cheaper, then go for the Powergen...unless you need a carrying pouch and short USB cable.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0073F92OK" id="B0073F92OK-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-28:</strong> My wife's phone or the Bluetooth would good dead, so I bought this to try help out and it works really well!

Two lights *does* mean the battery is half full.So, how does it work, you ask?  I was able to charge my iPhone 4S from 20% to 100% three times.

The battery pack is recharged through a standard Mini USB port on the side (marked "IN") and can take power from the included AC Power Adapter or from a PC with the supplied USB cable. The unit has two USB ports for the outputs (.6A and 2A), so it can use the USB cable that came with the device being charged (with the exception of some Nokia phones, according to the box instructions) or with the included cables and connectors. I also like that the unit shuts itself off when the device is fully charged.Testing (very unscientifically) -5% charge Kindle Fire to 100% in 3.5 hours25% charge HTC EVO 4G with extended 3500mAh battery to 100% in 2 hours33% charge iPhone 4 to 100% in 60 minutesThis unit is small enough to easily fit in a pocket, purse, or PC case, and it packs enough power to be meaningful when needed.Highly Recommended! I also tested and liked the smaller "PowerGen Mobile Juice Pack 5200mAh External Battery Pack"CFHNote: The manufacturer provided a unit for review but that in no way influences my rating or comments.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0073F92OK" id="B0073F92OK-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-17:</strong> Works exactly like it should... it recharged my iphone three times on a 13 hour international flight.

Prices are bouncy and coming down.This 8400 mAh model is enough to charge your iPhone 3-4 times, your iPad-2 80%, or your iPad-3 40%. Tablet users may want larger. (Note 1 explains mAh)They're not forever. Usually rated for 500 charge cycles, but they can die much sooner. Warranty and customer service matter.- - - Price Alerts - - -You can save money by waiting for price dips. There's an "Online Price Alert" that will email you whenever this or any amazon product dips below your target price. Google it. Or try camelcamelcamel.- - - Disclosure - - -The manufacturer gave me this product for review. I believe my review is impartial.- - - About the PowerGen 8400mAh - - -After checking it out for a month, I'd say this is a solid product, probably comparable to the alternatives listed below.PROs:- 1 year warranty (see comparison below)- Charges iPhone 3-4 times at full speed (see Note 2)- Fit and finish are very good- Power-in is a standard Micro-USB connector. (Use substitute cords of any length, and any AC adapter. Some other brands have a round power-in jack with dedicated AC adapter.)OKs:- Capacity 8400 mAh: Great for smartphones. Tablet users may want more.- Reliability: New model, but the identical Anker 8400 has been out for 1+ year with few Amazon review gripes. Mine had a bad cable (which i didn't plan to use anyway -- see Note 3).- 2 outputs: 0.6 Amps and 2 Amps (markings are hard to read)- Comes with a 7-piece interconnect system for most devices. I'd leave it in the box and use regular cables instead (see Note 3).- Comes with 1 Amp AC adapter (10 hours stated charge time). Faster recharge possible with 2 Amp AC adapter.- Battery status is 4-light method, no percentage readout. (see Note 4)CONs:- Glossy finish: Fingerprint magnet. Can slide around. Bad idea.- - - Size & Weight - - -2.45" x 3.9" x .87" (Deck of cards)6.6 oz.- - - Embedded Cable Alternatives - - -An embedded Micro-USB cable is a big plus. Save space. No tangle, mess, or leaving behind.-Anker 6000mAh-PowerGen 6000mAh-PowerGen 9000mAh- - - Notes - - -Note 1: mAH stands for milli-Amp hours. It's how much juice the battery pack holds. 8400 mAh is 8.4 Amp-hours.Note 2: Charging Specs: I tested an iPhone 4S with the PowerGen's 2A port. Did not test tablets or other phones.Capacity was 3.43 iPhone charges. (9%->90% + 49%->90% +  29%->90% + 5%->90% + 50%->90% + 28%->63%). Manual says the slower 0.6 amp port can achieve 4 iPhone charges.Charging speed averaged 1.0% per minute from the 2A port -- same as an Apple wall charger. Charging speed does not diminish as the PowerGen runs down. (At times it achieved 1.11% per minute, even with bits of screen use during the test. My testing stopped at 90%. iPhone charges slower from 80% to 100% with all chargers).PowerGen did not seem to heat up, ever.Note 3: 7-piece interconnect system includes Apple, USB-mini, USB-micro, 2mm round (Nokia), and 4mm round (PlayStation Portable). Plus special 6" and 25" cables. I find it cheesy, awkward, and losing pieces is way too easy. Use regular device cables.Note 4: Battery status indicator - 4 lights indicate 0-25%, 25-50%, etc. They show a lower reading while charging than when at rest.~~~ Comments & questions welcome ~~~</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0073F92OK" id="B0073F92OK-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-13:</strong> I purchased one of these several weeks ago, and it has performed well. It was indispensable with keeping a Galaxy Nexus running over a long day. It had enough juice to keep that phone juiced up for at least 2 days before its battery was drained. It works every bit as well with my Galaxy S3. It worked so well that my spouse asked for one to keep her Razr going during very long days, and frequent airport layovers. Unfortunately, that one was dead on arrival. Hoping it was a fluke, I arranged to return it (which happened without a problem), and ordered a third unit. It has worked just fine, and my spouse raved about it after she returned from a week long business trip. All in all I am very satisfied with it. If you have a smart phone and need something to keep it charged through a long day, its seems like a good choice.Pros: good capacity, charges smart phones about as quickly as most 110v adapters. It has a built in LED flashlight (sorry of unnecessary, but it did come in handy one time while finding a set of dropped keys...so I will list it as a pro).Cons: 1 out of 3 was dead. To be fair, a refund was had without hassle or delay. It is glossy, so it gets covered in prints easily (does that really matter with a battery pack?).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0073F92OK" id="B0073F92OK-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-04:</strong> In my family we have a bunch of iPhones.  I also own a Kindle Fire and my wife has an iPad.  Both her iPad and my Kindle require the larger output chargers (2.1A).  This charger works for both of us.  I've used a LOT of different mobile chargers this year, and this one is definitely one of my two favorites.Here's what I love best about this charger (and I think all Kindle Fire owners should agree):  It has one input port that I haven't seen on any other portable chargers--a micro USB.Why is that important?  No need for proprietary cables.I hate proprietary cables.  I don't want to have to carry around a bunch of tips and fittings to make all my stuff work.  It's bad enough that Apple products require their own cables, but I really don't want to have to bring yet another cable along to charge my charger.  That's why this one is awesome for me and my Kindle Fire (same goes for any other devices that use the micro USB connection).  I already carry myAmazonBasics USB Cable - 2.0 A Male to Micro B (6 Feet / 1.8 Meters)wherever I go.  They're cheap enough that I keep one at home, at my office, in my truck, and in my briefcase.  So now, wherever I can plug in my Kindle Fire, I can also plug in this mobile charger.This thing is great.  With 8400mAh (milliampere-hours), it has a lot of power for multiple charges.  I can charge my iPhone and my Kindle Fire both more than once from this charger.  This is ideal for travel or even for commuting with public transportation, because there are plenty of times when I need a charge and I can't get to an outlet.  It's especially great for long flights, because I can easily burn through the charge on my iPhone or Fire if I'm watching videos or playing games.  But I actually use this the most sitting right on my couch in the evening.  At the end of the day, my devices are out of charge just like I am.  It's great to be able to plug them into this little charger and be able to charge them and use them at the same time while I watch TV--without having to use a stupid extension cord.I should point out that although you can use a micro USB cable to charge this, it also comes with its own proprietary charger (which went straight into the drawer in my case).  It also has a huge set of tips for just about any device you can think of.  So don't feel left out if you don't have the same love affair with the micro USB connection as I do.I mentioned that I've used a bunch of different chargers this year and that this one is one of my favorites (or probably my new favorite).  What do I love about it so much (besides the micro USB connection)?  Well...* It's very compact.  This charger is smaller than some of the smaller 5000mAh chargers I own (and those things only give 1A output, so no joy for my Kindle or iPad).  It's definitely smaller than any high-output charger that I own.  Its footprint is roughly the same width of my iPhone (with its case on) and about an inch less in length.  It's probably about twice as thick as an iPhone 4 without a case.* It has one of the cleaner designs I've seen.  This family of chargers is relatively new, and a lot of them look like they were designed very quickly and without much attention to quality or appearance.  This one looks really nice though.  The case is very high-gloss plastic, which makes it easy to wipe off and keep clean from smudges and dust.* The charge level indicators are very bright and visible.  Some of my other chargers are difficult to tell how charged they are (you have to push a button to read the level).  And some of them don't give any indication of charge level at all.  This one has four blue glowing circles.  When it's charging, the blue lights pulse to indicate that it is charging and the lights stay on steady to show the charge state (one steady light means 25%, two means 50%, three means 75% and four means it's done).  This is nice for taking the guesswork out of it.  These lights also give you a quick indicator whether it's turned on or not.  The power button is recessed and a little tough to activate, so these lights let you know right away whether it's on.* This also includes a small white LED flashlight.  That's a nice feature for some, but I really don't have a use for it.I've used other PowerGen products in the past, so I'm confident in the product's reputation and quality and I believe that the company stands behind their products.8400mAh is a lot of charging time to carry around.  If it's just for one person, it will keep you charged up for a couple of days.  Or if it's for a family on a trip, you can pass it around and charge everyone up (or even charge two devices at once).  I highly recommend this charger.I was provided this charger for review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0073F92OK" id="B0073F92OK-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-04-23:</strong> I've been using this PowerGen 8400mAh Power Bank for several weeks now and I have to say that I absolutely love it!My main usage for this device is to run a Clear wireless hotspot as well as keeping other mobile devices charged up when they start to run low.  The interface is extremely easy to use and it's also easy to know how much power this device has left before it will need another charge.When it comes to the Clear hotspot, it runs great using this PowerGen battery pack and it will go for hours with no problem at all.  This lets me setup a wireless access point when I'm at the range making videos and running other tests with our sound metering equipment.The PowerGen also works great for charging up some of the other devices that charge through a USB port (which more and more are doing these days).  The only device I've found that just won't charge is my Asus Transformer Prime tablet; but, the battery in that tablet runs forever anyway - so it isn't a huge deal.Overall, I highly recommend this battery pack if you need a portable power solution for your electronics while away from home!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0073F92OK" id="B0073F92OK-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-09:</strong> I know 5 months is not long but in technology and electronics it's almost a lifetime.  This external power supply charges via a micro USB port and has (1) 0.6Amp and (1) 2.0Amp USB power out port.  So you can charge the iPhone, Android, Tablet, or other higher demand device while charging a BT earpiece or other smaller power demand device.  This ext power supply can charge my Nexus 5 3 times (plus a little more) without having to recharge.  It also has an LED flashlight bulb which is pretty useful actually. It comes with a 6&#34; USB cable and a 2' cable (if I remember correctly).  It easily fits in your pocket and is slightly bigger than a deck of cards.

It's small (about 3.75" x 2.4" x 0.7") and fairly lightweight (7 ounces), and with 8400 mAh of reserve power (the equivalent of about 3-4 rechargeable 1.2V NiMH AA batteries), it should recharge just about any small mobile device.When I received the battery pack, three of the four charge indicator lights were on, signifying a 50-75% charge. I plugged it into an electrical outlet, and about two hours later, it was fully charged. The product description indicates that a full charge can be restored to a drained battery pack in 9-10 hours with the included 5.3V/1A AC adapter. I also tried recharging the battery pack with a PowerGen Dual Port USB 2.1A 10W AC Travel Charger. I didn't time the recharging with the PowerGen AC adapter, but with 10 watts of power, it should reduce the charging time by as much as 50%.I've tested the battery pack with several mobile devices that we have, including a Kindle Fire, Kindle 3 (aka Kindle Keyboard), iPhone 4, and a Samsung Stratosphere cellphone, and it worked as advertised to extend the battery life. I did not attempt to quantify exactly how much extension of battery life it provided, but with 8400 mAh of power, it should be significant, even with the higher power consumption of devices like the Kindle Fire.The battery pack kit contained two cables (identical except for the length) and five different plug types, including an Apple plug, a micro USB plug, and two others that I didn't recognize (there were two of the micro USB plugs). As far as I know, you could recharge two devices simultaneously, since the battery pack has two ports.A nice extra feature of the battery pack is a built-in LED flashlight. The power button is flush with the case and requires two presses, so there's little chance of accidentally turning it on and depleting the battery.One minor complaint: The battery pack has two output ports - one for 5.3V/2000mA and one for 5.3V/600mA. The port next to the flashlight is labeled 0.6A and the other port is labeled 2A, but the labels are very hard to read. (It's much easier to read if you look on the side of the case, where the labels are easier to read below their respective ports.)Just a reminder: Any rechargeable battery loses some of its charge every day, so if you keep this or any other battery pack in your purse or backpack or briefcase, you need to take it out occasionally and recharge it.The bottom line: A very handy, indispensable little gadget for anyone on the go whose cellphone or other small electronic devices run out of battery power and an AC or vehicle charger is not available.Note: The seller offered to send me a PowerGen Duo-Power External Battery Pack 8400mAh to test and review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0073F92OK" id="B0073F92OK-review23" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-06:</strong> haven't used it much.

Since my wife does not own an iPhone I wanted an charger that I could also use for her Motorola phone.  I had not heard of PowerGen but based on the reviews I decided to purchase it.The PowerGen Duo-Power comes with outlet plug to connect to the USB cable to charge the device.  It also includes and iPhone connector as well as other connectors and two USB cables with two different lengths.  Several other brands do not include the outlet plug or cables which is a nice plus.As others have written, the device can be used right out-of-the-box since it is already charged 3/4 of the way (3 out of the 4 charging circles are lit).  I tested it out and was charging my iPhone 4S and older 3GS at the same time with no issue; very easy to use.  I does include a flashlight which I may or may not use but is there just in case.  Click the on button twice to turn on the flashlight and again to turn off.The day I received the battery pack, my wife's phone needed charging but we going out.  One of the included connector tips fit her phone and I used one of the the short USB cable and her phone began charging.  With the compact size and short cable it fit in her purse without a problem and no long long cable to get tangled.  Her phone has a sliding keyboard so when responding to a text, she just kept the PowerGen under her phone and was able to compose and send her text while still charging the phone.  After about two to three hours we disconnected the phone and there was still three charging circle displayed on the PowerGen.There was a storage case shown on Amazon's website that was out-of-stock but I found a small storage case at Target (cannot find it online to include link) in the luggage area near travel supplies.  It is a zippered, semi-hard shell, case with a corded hand strap for around $13. It has an elastic band on one half that secures the battery pack and an elastic net on the other half of the case to hold all the accessories.  The case measures aproximately 5 1/2 inches long by 2 inches high and 3 1/2 inches wide.I can honestly recommend this product to anyone looking for a compact battery charger that includes the necessary accessories and also suggest checking your local Target for the case I found.  Pictures of the case were recently added to the PowerGen pictures.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0073F92OK" id="B0073F92OK-review31" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-04:</strong> This product has saved me on several occasions.

I don't think I've ever met a battery pack I didn't like.  At 8400 mAh, it is middle of the road in portability and power.  It's larger than the 5200 mAh cousins and smaller/more lightweight than the 10000 mAh battery packs.I prefer the 8400 mAh battery packs because they have enough juice to charge up my Kindle Fire from critically low to full charge with enough juice left over for another partial charge.  At the same time, it's not large or too heavy to comfortably carry in my purse.  Most ladies will agree that every ounce counts.  I don't even like heavy key rings.According to the manufacturer, this battery pack has the capacity to charge the following:- iPhone 4: 3-4 full charges- iPad 2: 80% of one full charge- iPad 3: 40% of one full chargeSOME HIGHLIGHTSThe following are features that are not universally included with all brands of battery packs:1)  PowerGen comes with two charging cords: 7 inches and 27 inches.  Not all chargers give us a choice.  The cords come with six adapters (Playstation Portable, Nokia, mini-USB, TWO micro-USB, iPhone/iPad).  Two micro-USB adapters are necessary, believe it or not.  It is the most used adapter and I bent one on a battery pack from a different maker (which did not supply me with a spare).2)  If I lose the charging cord, I can still charge my battery pack.  The battery pack uses a standard micro-USB connection.  Yes, some battery packs use a proprietary cord.  I'm thankful this does not.3)  PowerGen comes with a USB wall adapter, so we can plug this into an outlet.  Some brands only come with a USB cord for charging.4)  PowerGen comes with two USB ports (0.6 Amps and 2 Amps) for charging your devices.  Yes, you can charge two devices at once!Other features PowerGen and all my batteries have include a handy LED light, power indicators, and automatic shut-off when not connected to devices.  They are always sleek and attractive.  PowerGen is no exception.The 8400 mAh Mobile Juice Pack is sufficient for Kindle Fire, Kindle 3G, and smartphone owners.  If you have an iPad, I'd recommend a 10000 mAh or higher battery.This product was provided for review by EnerMall.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0073F92OK" id="B0073F92OK-review33" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-03:</strong> In today's technological age we are a slave to electrical devices.  One of the most important attribute to portable units are their battery life which has been a limiting factor and can cause a lot of frustration when one is running out of juice.  The Powergen and many other portable batteries were made to alleviate such problem.  This is a review based on my opinion and findings.  I have already full charge and discharge the battery 5 times before fully testing it out.Pros:Size & Durability - Being roughly a size of a full deck of a bridge playing card.  It is very small and portable for its rated capacity.  It is pretty dense, solid, and feels of high quality in the hand.  The polish will attract finger prints but they are easily wiped off with a shirt.Input/Output - Two convenient USB outputs rated at 0.6amp for cells phone and 2.0amp for tablets.  Micro USB input rated up to 1.5amp for charging which takes about 8 hours to fully recharge using the included wall adapter.  It is not recommended to charge via a PC, 0.5amp is way too slow.LED Light - Double click the on button and you'll get a small led emitting light.  This may come in handy when you are looking through your bag trying to locate a USB cord.  By no means it is used for night walking.Accessories - It is nice how this item comes with a 1amp USB wall charger.  A lot of cell phone adapters including Apple and Sony PSP.  The micro USB input used to recharge the unit is extremely useful since it is easily replaceable.  I notice how many other customers complain of a DC (round jack with center pin) wall adapter.Customer Service - EnerMall had provided the best Amazon seller customer service I have ever gotten.  They provide very courtesy, prompt, and extremely helpful support.  The battery also comes with a 1 year warranty.Cons:Rated Capacity - Even though it is rated at 8400mAh it can only be used to recharge your device to approximately 5500-6000mAh total.  In other words it can recharge my HTC Evo 3D 1800mAh phone from 0-100% about three times.  If it is feasible, I recommend turning off your phone or tablet during charging to fully maximize the Powergen's capacity.  It is approximately 65-70% efficient since the rest of its juice is required to run itself.  Remember it converts a 3.7v battery to 5v and by using a 2amp USB output it will get a little warm but nothing to be alarm about.  Just keep that concept in mind and don't expect anything near 8400mAh to be fully ultilized for charging purposes.Price Increase - It seems like these batteries are getting popular and are becoming quick selling gadgets.  The increased in demand has also caused them to inflate a little.  This trend is seem with other Amazon sellers as well (i.e. Anker, Incredicharge, New Trent, etc...)Conclusion:  For the price, this battery is extremely convenient considering you don't have to worry about finding an outlet at the airport or dead battery on a short camping trip.  You really can't go wrong with this extra security.Disclosure:  This battery was provided as a sample for review purposes.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0073F92OK" id="B0073F92OK-review34" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-13:</strong> The Powergen 8400mAh  is big enough to fully charge your iPad2 and still has more power to charge most of your smartphones.  It is also one of the  smallest juice packs I have  in terms of capacity to its physical size ratio, making it a very portable gadget that you can just throw in into your bag.  It can charge two devices at the same time woth the two USB slots.  One slot is rated 2.1 Amp for the iPads and tablets, and the other one is for smaller devices like cell phones, etc.Most connectors that you will need are included in the box; iPad/iPod connector, PSP, Blackberry, Samsung, Nokia phones, micro USBs, and more.  Nope, it doesn't have Nintendos.  It even has a tiny ice cube wall outlet charger similar to the iPod's.  The cool thing about it is that you can also use it to charge your gadgets directly to a 120V outlet; it is rated 1A.The flashlight is a very nifty bonus.  You just press the power button twice to turn it on and to turn it off.  It is easy to tell how much more juice is remaining by pressing the power button once.  The 4 LED lights represent approximately 25 per cent of capacity per light.Disclaimer: I received the Powergen 8400mAh as a complimentary review item from the distributor.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0073F92OK" id="B0073F92OK-review35" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-24:</strong> This PowerGen Mobile Juice Pack 8400mAh External Battery Pack is a great way to recharge my iPhone 4S, (I've actually been able to recharge it about 4 times when it's low but not completely run down.) my Kindle Fire and my iTouch. This type of battery pack is so useful when you're traveling and not near an outlet for long periods of time or even at home during a power outage. I can remember a time a year or two ago when our electric company was working on some power lines and my office phone which is VOIP was out for hours. Of course, that would be the day when I forgot to recharge my cell phone and had lots of business related phone calls to make. I ended up driving around with my phone plugged into the car charger for over an hour to recharge it. If I'd only had one of these battery packs!This product was provided to me by the manufacturer for an impartial review. It comes with a 7-piece interconnect system that has enough sizes for most devices, certainly everything I have around here. It measures 3 3/4 inches x 2 3/8 inches x 3/4 inches, a nice compact size for the amount of power and fits easily into a pocket, purse or briefcase. It has four little blue lights on the top that indicate how much power it has left: 100%, 75%, 50% and 25%. There is an input jack and a 1A Adapter that will fully charge it in about 9 to 10 hours. You could also use a 10W Adapter like the one that comes with an iPad and that will take about 5 to 6 hours.It has two output ports: .6A and 2A. The 2A is great for charging a tablet such as the Kindle Fire or iPad. The .6A was fine for charging my iPhone. You can also charge 2 phones or other devices at a time. This is such a useful product for peace of mined when I'm away from home and lessens the concern about power outages which we occasionally have in this area. Two thumbs up for a great product.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0073F92OK" id="B0073F92OK-review36" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-06-23:</strong> This PowerGen Mobile Juice Pack external battery has a lot of power - and then some.  I took this on an overnight trip with a friend of mine - we had an iPhone and an Android SmartPhone.  Both of these devices drain power quickly, especially when using them like we were for directions, web surfing and other tasks that drain the battery.  I had charged this external battery the night before I left, and it lasted throughout our entire trip, most often charging both phones at the same time.  I was amazed.  It charged both our phones at least twice during this 36 hour trip.This battery pack is well constructed - it is heavy and durable.  The shell is a shiny black plastic composite of some type. It has a micro USB charging port on one side to charge the battery pack.  On the top are dual USB output ports so you can charge more than one device.  The on indicator lights and power left lights consist of four blue LED rings on the face of the battery pack.  Presumably one of the two USB output ports has a higher power output rating than the other, but my friend and I switched off using both ports and we had no problem charging our devices.I've been very pleased with the performance of the external battery pack - I'm considering buying another for backup on longer trips.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0073F92OK" id="B0073F92OK-review37" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-11:</strong> I bought this to charge my HTC EVO 4G LTE when i;m away from my car or an outlet since the batteru isn't removeable.

Each of these devices requires a 5 Volt DC charge supply, so this 5 Volt power pack seemed like the best option.Some of the directions and specifications can be a bit confusing as the instructions are a translation.  However, I find that the translation is fairly easy to understand if you just take a little extra time.One of the things you need to consider right up front is how large a battery pack you need and what charge rate you require.  The size of the battery pack affects how much of a charge you can put on a device and how often before it is depleted.  The charge rate affects how long it takes to replace the charge on your device and whether it will charge at all!  A perfect example is the Apple IPAD requires a 2 Amp Charge rate!!!  If you plug it into a 600ma charger, it will essentially NOT CHARGE!  This battery pack is large enough to repower my cell phone many times, my IPOD 3 times, and is large enough to put a 40% charge back on my IPAD 3.The second thing you need to know is that whatever the charge time is using your normal charger, that is how long it is going to take with an external battery pack!  There are NO shortcuts here.  So, if it takes 5 to 6 hours to charge your IPAD from a 40% charge to a 100% charge state using a charger, that is how long it is going to take using an external battery pack that is sized large enough for the purpose.This battery pack has 2 separate charging ports, a 600ma hour port and a 2A hour port.  That works well for my cell phone which uses a 600ma charger and also for my IPAD and my IPOD which both use a 2A charger.As many folks have commented on, this battery pack comes with a cable that has multiple tips that can be changed out to fit multiple devices.  The Battery pack itself uses a micro USB port to charge it with (one of the supplied tips).  My cell phone uses a small narrow barrel charger (one in the parts bag) and my IPOD and IPAD use the standard APPLE connector (also supplied in the parts bag).  The unit also comes with a 1A charger, but I prefer using the 2A charger that the company sells separately (it has a 2A and a 600ma charge port, just like on this battery).  The battery recharges MUCH faster using the 2A charger.One thing to note, when you go to charger the battery the charge indicator lights will come on and will remain on during the charging cycle.  The number of lights that are on indicate the level of charge.  KEEP charging the battery for at least an hour after the 4th light comes on since it comes on when the battery is between 75 and 100% of charge!!Recharging all of my devices worked well.  You need to remember though that this battery will NOT fully charge an IPAD 3 from less than 60% of charge!  It will replace 40% of the battery capability (the battery in the IPAD is MUCH larger than the capacity of this charging battery) from whatever point you connect it.  So, if you are at 40% it will recharge it to 80%.  If you are at 10 % it will recharge it to 50%.  One other option that you have is to just plug in this battery pack while you are using your IPAD and use the capacity of it before you use up the capacity of your IPAD.IMPORTANT NOTE:  You MUST press the battery status button once you connect the battery pack to your device to start the charging cycle!!!!!I have used this battery extensively on all of the above devices and it works exactly as it should!  It has never heated up on me and that is a real plus.  This battery pack definitely extends the useful time of your devices and is great to have when there is no option for using regular AC power to recharge your device.I would highly recommend this unit.  The reason that the device earns four stars instead of 5 stars is because of the number of loose parts for the cable and it does not have a storage bag to put them into.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0073F92OK" id="B0073F92OK-review39" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-10:</strong> I'm using it mainly to charge my Samsung Galaxy SIII which guzzles juice like it's the 70s.It works pretty much as intended, but the main flaw is that it charges my phone very slowly.In an hour it only increased the charge by about 10%.It has a white led which you can use as a flashlight, which is a nice touch, although it's not very strong, so you cannot really use it as a flashlight replacement.Another problem is that it does not come with the new type of iPhone/iPad connector, so you need to get an adapter.It does not come with a wall charger either, so you either charge it from a computer or you need to get an adapter.Overall okay, but the slow charging is annoying.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0073F92OK" id="B0073F92OK-review40" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-11:</strong> Had high hopes for this one.

But then, hours later when I went to try and turn it on to plug another device, the lights would not turn on at all. When I pushed the power button no lights turned on, even the little flashlight thing didn't work anymore. Tried charging it again and the lights indicated a charge, but after unplugging and trying to power it on again, nothing happened. It was just dead.

Even if you have access to the wall/AC jack, sometime you don't feel like carrying those AC adapters. Generally speaking, I think most people can use some extra juice on their devices. And this battery pack works well to provide additional power well and compatible with most devices. This product also has a decent built-in LED flashlight (double click the power button to operate the LED flashlight).I was curious on why the two ports have two different amperage rating and after a bit of research, here's what I think the reason is:Q: Can I blow up my device if I plug it to the wrong port (e.g. take a phone with 500mA requirement/wall charger and we plug it into the 2000mA)?A: No. You can plug any USB device into any USB cable and into any USB port, and nothing will blow up -- and in fact, using a more powerful charger should speed up battery charging.Q: So if you can't blew your device, why not make both USB port 2000mA (vs 2000mA and 600mA)?A: Some older devices (mainly pre-2007) will not take high-amperage USB (e.g. 2000mA), so you might need to use the lower amperage option to make the charging work (though as mentioned above plugging it into the 2000mA won't blow up the device)This PowerGen battery pack is compatible with most devices but it doesn't hurt to check the compatibility list before you buy.Compatible with:- Apple iPhone 4s,4,3Gs,3G,2G/iPod Touch/iPad/iPad 2/iPod Nano,shuffle,classic- Amazon Kindle Fire, and all other kindles- Blackberry Curve/Storm 9530/Storm 2 9550 9520/Tour 9630 Style 9670 Bold 9650 9700 9780/Torch 9800- Google Nexus One/Nexus S- HTC Sensation XE XL/Thunderbolt/Flyer/EVO 3D- LG Optimus,2x,V,S,T/Quantum/Vortex- Motorola Atrix/Bionic/Droid Razr,X,X2,2,3,Pro,R2D2/Xoom/Triumph- Nokia N900/N8/N97/C6/C3- Samsung Galaxy S 2/Epic 4G/ Galaxy Nexus- Sony Experia /X1/X10/X8/Arc/Neo/Play/MiniNot Compatible with:- Galaxy Tab series- Asus TransformerHere's what you would expect to get when using this battery pack.You can opt for higher/lower mAh battery rating if you want more/less juice.- 80% of iPad 2 Battery life- 400% of 4G 4S 3G 3Gs iPhone Battery life- 40% of iPad 3 Battery life- 150% of Kindle Fire Battery life- 10 hours iPad 2 movie playing time- 40 hours iPhone internet time- 70 hours iPhone audio timeOverall, this PowerGen Duo-Power External Battery Pack 8400mAh is a very solid product.

Rather than repeat all of the features that I described that both units have in common, let me focus on what makes this product different.1. This is larger and measures 3 3/4" x 2 3/8" x 3/4". However, this is not bulky and more than compact enough to bring when you travel.2. This has two output ports: .6A and 2A. The 2A is great for charging an iPad. I charged an iPad from 80% to 100% in the same time it takes when plugged into an AC outlet, and I barely made a dent in this unit's power supply.3. The 5200 has a large power button on the top that makes it easy to operate the flashlight. This unit has a much smaller power button located to the right of the micro USB, but it's still pretty easy to use.Bottom line: This is a good unit for regular charging of an iPad, and also where you need a longer power supply than what is provided by the 5200. Except for the differences I mentioned, both units work the same, come with the same cables and adaptors, and are effective.Disclosure: The manufacturer sent me this product to review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0073F92OK" id="B0073F92OK-review45" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-26:</strong> Holds about 2-3 full charges for my iPhone, which is more than enough for long haul flights across the Pacific or Atlantic.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0073F92OK" id="B0073F92OK-review46" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-28:</strong> I just received this unit and my first impression is very favorable! It looks great with a sleek, polished black plastic body with white accents and blue lights to indicate charge level. It is rough 3/4" shorter than an iPhone 4s and roughly twice as thick. It weights roughly the same as an iPhone 4s, maybe just a little more.The unit arrived with about a 3/4ths charge, I plugged in my phone and within a couple of minutes the battery had risen from 88 to 93%. The flashlight works great with a simple double-tap of the power button to turn it on or off. I had expected some low quality connectors and adapters based off past experience with similar products from a different brand, but the connectors that came with the PowerGen have a nice solid, tight fit. It comes with an iPhone connector, two micro-USB, one mini-USB, a nokia and a PSP connector. There is also a small 6" and a longer 18" USB cord that both work with any of the connectors.I'll update this review after I've used the device more and if I have any problems with it, but right now I'm very glad that I selected this item over other similar devices that I compared prior to purchasing!All in all I am very impressedUpdate 7/20/2013After "heavy" usage over the last week (charge iPhone daily and iPad once, recharged the power pack twice) the power pack will now only take a 50% charge, regardless of the power source (USB, car charger, wall outlet). This being the first significant, repeated usage of the power pack I'm a bit disappointed to say the least. Prior to this I'd used it a dozen times or so and usually only to charge my phone once or twice a week tops. I'm going to contact PowerGen and hope to get a replacement. I'll update this review with further details related to the customer service and if I'm able to get it replaced or not.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0073F92OK" id="B0073F92OK-review47" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-05:</strong> A bit expensive, but worth it.

It's really not a big deal when I'm home and can charge it easily. But when I travel or camp, I'm always torn with "using it" and "depleting the battery so much that it's dead when I NEED it". Having this device will give me peace of mind for certain.It arrived today in perfect condition with a partial charge (which is great so you can use it immediately out of the box). Right away I read the flyer and looked over all the different connectors. I was happy to see so many different ones-this will work with my husband's Android phone too. The flyer was obviously translated from some other language-many grammatical mistakes and poor wording. But, luckily, it doesn't take an advanced degree to figure out how to plug the pieces into the ports in which they fit. The directions are just a backup. Had it up and running in just minutes.My iPhone 4 quickly recognized it and started charging. In about an hour it went from 60% to 94%. Neither the phone or charger are hot/heating up (which was my main concern). What I really like is that this charger has either a short cord or a long cord you can use to connect the device. I don't personally like the idea of the snap on battery units-seems like you're just asking for it to crack off and either break your device or get a plastic remnant jammed in there permanently. It might be a little awkward to be talking on the phone while it's charging (unless you use the long cord). But, at least you will be talking on the phone and not cussing at one with a dead battery.The size of the unit is great. It is about the weight of a pack of cards. I like the shiny surface and it feels like it is made of substantial material (not plastic or junky). I really like the indicator lights so you know just where you are in its battery life. The LED level indicator lights each represent 25%. After 1 hour of charging my iPhone, it's still at a level three and hasn't drained enough to drop a level. I also like that you can power off the unit so it holds it's juice longer. The flashlight-well that's just an added bonus!Having TWO USB ports is pretty cool. When two of us travel, we can both be charging instead of arguing about who gets the port. The directions imply (because of poor wording) that the first output is 0.6A for mobile phones and the other one is 2A for iPads. But, you can  use the 2A port for phones too. So which is which doesn't really matter. BUT, I'll probably mark the 0.6A port with a permanent marker dot or something so I can easily see it. Using the 2A port will drain the battery quicker according to the directions (but it will also charge your device faster). For example, on 0.6A it will take 120 minutes to fully charge my phone but on 2A the directions say it will take only 80 minutes.The amount of power this little baby stores is really impressive. It can power the flashlight for 380 hours on level 4 (fully charged). The fact it can charge 2 devices at once is great. The size of it and the fact its smaller than your wallet is good. I'd like to get a little case or something for it so it won't get scratched in my purse and to hold all the connectors I'll need. I've already recommended this to my friend who has an older HTC phone (we tried it out last night and it worked)with an unfortunate battery that won't even hold it's charge for a day. Having this device with me when I'm away from an electrical outlet will definitely give me peace of mind and confidence.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B0073F92OK', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B0073F92OK', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B008D6QVR4</h2>    <p class="price"> $B008D6QVR4</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008D6QVR4" id="B008D6QVR4-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-23:</strong> Bought this case for my wife and it fits the AT&T S3 perfectly.

I spent a lot of time enjoying videos on my now-defunct Galaxy S 2, so when I looked for the One SV, I was sad to see it missing the kickstand I'd seen come from the factory of other HTC phones. This case effectively solves the problem.The best and worst part of this hard case is the hybrid nature. It has a rubbery inner sleeve with a harder outer layer that clamps around both it and the phone. The outer layer keeps things mostly secure, but the rubber can still slip or give if pushed. Still, the kickstand leaves the speaker(s) free so voice and video continue to sound great as they normally do for this phone. Not enough negatives to knock it down further, but I personally felt it was enough to keep it from getting a perfect score.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00B7A9Z0S', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00B7A9Z0S', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00DBEK0TI</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00DBEK0TI</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DBEK0TI" id="B00DBEK0TI-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-29:</strong> This is a interesting twist on a kick stand case design. Rather than the typical folding legs, the kick stand is shaped like a tower, with the base of the tower serving as the kick stand. That's more visually interesting than a conventional fold-out leg.The case is made of plastic, but feels pretty sturdy. I have the blue metallic, and the color is dark and uniform throughout. It's actually closer to a black than a blue. The tower is a dark gray metallic shade that blends well with the dark case body. The tower is raised on the case but all the edges are smooth so it doesn't case any problem when holding the phone and, in fact, allows for a better grip on the case.Zero problems with fitting it on an iPhone. Holds the phone securely with no wiggling.The only issue I have is that the kick stand is not as sturdy as I would have hoped, especially around the hinge area. I've not had any problem with it so far, but it's not something that will withstand a lot of punishment. A metal stand with a metal hinge would have been better.[Sample provided for review]</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DBEK0TI" id="B00DBEK0TI-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-29:</strong> This cherry red snap-on case has one of the most unique designs I've seen for a smartphone case.  The back has a raised image of the Eiffel Tower, the lower portion of which snaps free from the case and acts as an easel to hold up the phone.  This position is great for FaceTime, games, showing photographs, and using the speaker phone.The color of the case is awesome -- a pearlized cherry red.  But the execution of the easel leaves something to be desired.  First, the Eiffel Tower and easel are raised, like bas relief, and the phone cannot rest flat on a surface when the easel is not is use.  Also, the plastic of the easel fits into an open hole in the back, something that's great for storage but which is rough against the back of the phone.  Although it hasn't scratched my iPhone, I'm worried that it will.  Last, I have had problems with the legs of the easel popping out while I'm talking on the phone.  I have to be very careful to make sure they are firmly snapped in place.If you use your iPhone 5 a lot for FaceTime or use the speakerphone while you move about, then this case might be exactly what you need.  For me, however, the design flaws outweigh the convenience.

It is really very eye-catching.  Even before I open the case up to use the stand people are impressed by it, but when I show them the easel they never fail to be wowed.  -When I first got the case I wondered how durable it might be.  The stand takes a little time to loosen up.  I even chipped a nail the second or third time I tried to open the easel.  But now it works great.  This isn't designed for putting a lot of pressure on it, but for the weight of the phone it is terrific.  Before I got this case, I used to prop my phone up all the time while using it on speakerphone.  Now I have a case that is as attractive as it is functional.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DBEK0TI" id="B00DBEK0TI-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-30:</strong> I was provided an Amplim Eiffel iPhone 5 Case (Blue Metallic Color) for testing and review and was asked only to give my honest review, so this is what I found.What You Should Know Before You Buy:&#9830; Thin, stylish case that looks good and doesn't add much bulk.&#9830; Solid plastic case that offers primarily scratch protection to the body of the phone.&#9830; Perfect, tight fit.&#9830; All buttons and ports are easily accessible.&#9830; The stand looks cool, but isn't very sturdy and is set-up for for portrait viewing of your phone.  More "form over function".&#9830; No screen protection with no raised bezel around the screen.&#9830; No internal cushion so minimal impact protection.Detailed Review:&#9830; Background - I have a Black iPhone 5 that I keep in an Incipio Dual PRO Case (Incipio Dual PRO for iPhone 5 - Retail Packaging - Obsidian Black/ Obsidian Black).  The Incipio is a great blend of protection and size.  It has a silicone internal shell for cushion covered by a hard outer shell.  It adds some bulk, but not a crazy amount like an Otterbox.  When reviewing a case, I always think of my Incipio case for my comparisons.&#9830; Look and Installation - The product came in a clear hanging display box with minimal product information on it. Inside the box was only the case encased in a plastic holder that slid out of the box. The back of the blue metallic colored case has a raised up image of the Eiffel Tower that looks pretty cool and is tightly molded into the case.  The bottom half of the Eiffel Tower insert tilts out and acts as a phone stand.  The case is solid and slightly flexible making installation pretty easy.  Once on, the case fit perfectly.  It wrapped around the back and the sides, but did not extend past the screen at all, maintaining a fairly thin look, but providing no screen protection.  Once the case is on, it looks nice and adds only a little bit of bulk while having a fairly solid build.&#9830; Use and Performance - Once the case was installed, the case part worked as intended.  The top and bottom are open with the case wrapping around the corners to hold the case on.  There are also holes for access to the side buttons and a hole for the camera.  All buttons and ports were easily accessible.  The case is strong and offers a lot of scratch protection, but that is about it.  Since it doesn't have any kind of cushion with it being direct case to phone contact, you shouldn't expect much in the way of major drop or impact protection.  Also with the case only covering the sides and not extending past the screen at all, you really don't have any screen protection either.  The protection is fine as long as that is what you are looking for.  The bottom half of the Eiffel Tower stand piece tilts out and supports the phone in a Portrait (Tall) view.  It looks good, but is a little too weak to support much pressing on the phone.  It flexes quite a bit.  It also isn't built to support the phone in a Landscape (Wide, Horizontal) view.  The very bottom of the stand legs pop off and can give you a little better tilt when supporting the phone sideways, but then you run the risk of losing this little piece of the stand.  The case is good, but the stand could use some improvement.Conclusion:Overall, this is a nice case that provides scratch protection to the body.  It is not intended to provide major drop or impact protection and it is not intended to provide screen protection.  The Eiffel Tower stand design on the back looks really cool and will most likely be a discussion point with your friends but the stand function is only OK because it is a little too flexible for my liking and only really supports Portrait viewing.  The stand to me seems like more "form over function".  If you are looking for major damage protection covering the entire phone or a really strong stand, you should look elsewhere.  If you are looking for a cool case with some unique features that provides some basic iPhone protection, this case is worth a look.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DBEK0TI" id="B00DBEK0TI-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-14:</strong> As you probably already know with these kind of cases you can't expect Griffen or Otterbox protection on your phone, those cases are bulky and that's why they protect the phones so well. This case is not to be compared to those because it isn't in the same category as them. These cases are more lightweight and offer minor protection. This case specifically will get you protection on the back and on the left and right sides, but on the front, and top and bottom of the phone you can expect minimal protection to no protection at all. The reason as to why this case got 4 stars is because it offers less protection than most of the lightweight ones, it doesn't protect the top or bottom which is a drawback for such a beautifully built case. The kickstand will definitely come in hand for a plethora of people though. It is pretty sturdy, with time it might become weaker, but as of testing this it has held up well. The colors and details on this case are awesome, they really give your iPhone a uniqueness that no other case can provide. It seems like a souvenir that you would be able to buy in Paris, and I can definitely recommend this to you if you don't really have a concern for much protection on the phone. I rate this product 4 stars out of 5 stars!I hope this review has helped you out!Note that I was provided this product for testing and evaluation as well as for a completely honest & unbiased review, the words stated above are my own.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DBEK0TI" id="B00DBEK0TI-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-19:</strong> This is such a great idea I don't know why someone hasn't thought of it before. At least, this is the first case that I've seen with a kickstand. I can't remember how many times I wish I could stand my phone up instead of putting it against a book or something.The case itself is light and fits well. I like it that the buttons are exposed and easy to press. I've mentioned this before but I think the manufacturer should sell this to Parisian or French souvenir shops.The only suggestion I would make to improve this is to make the joint a ball joint or a circular joint so that the case can be stood up sideways as well.Overall, a simple cover that looks good and is functional. Totally awesome!

It's an interesting concept to have a kickstand built into an iPhone case, and the fact that it's designed to look like the Eiffel Tower (hence the name) is a nice touch. It works well, but you have to be careful and gentle with the stand, as it can easily snap off if you snag it on something.The bright red coloring is attractive, and the case is very sturdy. It snaps onto the iPhone easily, and the positioning of the holes for the controls align as they should. It provides a good level of scuff and scratch protection for the body of the phone. The kickstand on the back is recessed into the case, and it snaps out to provide a portrait display stand. For watching something on the iPhone without having to hold it, it works well.The only real drawback is that it's not that difficult to snag the stand on the edge of your pocket if that's where you carry your phone. If you're not careful, you can snap off the stand without trying. You'd still have a case, but the main benefit of this particular case is then lost. If I were going to have this case around on a regular basis, I'd probably reserve it for times when I was planning to display something that would benefit from the kickstand. Using it as an everyday case might be courting trouble with the stand snapping off.Disclosure:Obtained From: ManufacturerPayment: Free</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00DBEK0TI', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00DBEK0TI', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00DPIK2IO</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00DPIK2IO</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DPIK2IO" id="B00DPIK2IO-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-16:</strong> I had to trim some excess plastic from a small spot but otherwise it fits great and looks original.
