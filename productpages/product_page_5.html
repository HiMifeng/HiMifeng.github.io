It is the best screen protector I've ever used! I buy a lot of iphone4s products because I'm crazy about my phone! I go overboard on cases, protectors, and accessories in general. After I applied this to my phone, I got one for my boyfriend, bestfriend, sisters, brother, and parents! They all love it. It's so much cleaner-looking than the regular protectors that are shiny and get greasy looking. Also, my makeup doesn't stick to this as much.

It was so blurry compared to the original retina display that I felt like I was using the original iPhone, not the 4S. I wouldn't recommend using this screen cover if screen resolution is important to you. Instead, you should use the "Acase(TM) Apple iPhone 4 4S AcaseView Screen Protector Film Clear (Invisible) for iPhone 4 4S AT&T; and Verizon and Sprint (3 Pack + 3 Bonus Back Films)" that is also sold on Amazon.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003VPT5U2" id="B003VPT5U2-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-01-28:</strong> I have had several iPhones for a few years, and I believe this product to be the best screen protector I have yet used. Itis easy to apply, with no bubbling upon application. It also has been extremely scratch-proof, as attested by my use for thepast several months carrying my phone in my pocket with other objects, and not marring the screen at all.All in all, it has exceeded my expectations in every way! It is easy to view the screen in bright daylight, and very little blurring due to the matte finish.

This company sent me an email after my purchase thanking me for purchasing their product.

It does everythiing it says its suppose to do!! The best thing is the reduction of fingerprints. I hate fingerprints on my phone and with this screen protector you can't see them, you can see a little oil from your fingers which washes away easily but no actual fingerprints!!! Plus it's an anti-glare too. I have tried several protectors and I have never found ones that work so great! I also realy like that it goes on so smoothly and there's no cutting or trimming, it fits perfectly, and the tags that you use to pull the cover apart with come right off with no stickiness or residue! I truly cannot say enough about this protector, its by far the best. I highly recommend it, you won't regret it!!!!!!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003VPT5U2" id="B003VPT5U2-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-07:</strong> I have always used Zagg products int eh past.  However, after getting one for my Iphone 4 and having the edges peel I decided it was time to look elsewhere.  This product received decent reviews so I went with them, and as a bonus I got 2 protectors!  The application is a pain in the tail (even with the online tutorial.  I put the first one on and it was horrifically covered in air and dust bubbles.  I don't know what had happened.  I was in the bathroom with the shower on and I had washed my hands etc.  I decided to use the second after re-cleaning the phone and waiting 5 minutes for steam.  Same result as the first.  The cover looked terrible, simply terrible.  It was so bad I immediately went and ordered another brand and paid next day shipping so I wouldn't have to use this product another moment.  I have applied many screen protectors, all with success, but not in this case.  I would not buy again and would not recommend.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003VPT5U2" id="B003VPT5U2-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-21:</strong> I bought this because I like the Matte / anti-glare feature.  It works great for that purpose.  I however, have recently come to not like the anti-glare feature as much as when you look at the screen it's not the true clarity of the screen.  It looks almost strange like there are multi-colored dots all over the screen when there is a white backdrop. I feel that it tends to hurt my eyes when I look at the screen sometimes with the multi-colored dots.  I know it's just a side effect of the anti glare but I don't like to live with the side effect any longer.  However , if you don't mind it the anti-glare feature works great and helps drastically when outdoors in the sun.  So it's all about personal preference.  The quality of the protector though is great!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003VPT5U2" id="B003VPT5U2-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-11-25:</strong> Normally I do not take time to do this, but this is an exceptional product. After persevering for a while I have perfected the installation of this. Go into your bathroom, turn on the shower on hot to get steam. Then ignore the instructions and pull off the top protective wrap first. Pull off the bottom cover and position it on the iPhone (which you already cleaned with a paper towel and a spritz of windex). Take some Scotch tape, fold one end of it 1/8 inch over and stick that tape on the top of the screen cover as a handle with some tape hanging out over the side of the phone. You put the little flap towards the center so when you are done you can pull the tape off the protector from the inside out. Now you can ust that tape as a handle and easily lift up the screen protector as many times as you like using another piece of tape to take out whatever dust there is from either the screen or the protector. Reposition the tape handle to get bubbles and dust out wherever you see them. I was able to get a perfect, (and I mean perfect) install of this by just being patient. Zero bubbles. Using it with an Incipio Ngp Case, which pops right on and does not lift this protector. The protector has almost no adhesive. Do not be put off by that, and you will see that its a huge plus as you can reposition until you get it right. This is an amazing product, I could not be happier. Here is the link for the Incipio case that works flawlessly with these protectors: [...]</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003VPT5U2" id="B003VPT5U2-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-03-14:</strong> This screen protector comes with 2 in a package, as well as a cleaning cloth and a little card for application (to help avoid & smooth out air bubbles).  It was fairly easy to put on, had help with one and did one by myself.  I'm not sure how much it will protect the screen if the phone is dropped, but hopefully, I won't have to find out.  I will be ordering more!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003VPT5U2" id="B003VPT5U2-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-15:</strong> I have always liked mediadevils products...This protector worked like I wanted and I had no issues with it...I would buy from them again</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003VPT5U2" id="B003VPT5U2-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-01-25:</strong> It works. I like the matte finish to knock off the glare. Still leaves finger prints, but it's not as obvious as it would be without a protector. Pretty easy to apply. Just make sure the top is aligned to the front camera and receiver as perfectly as you can, because if it's off a little, it will only get worse as you get to the home button.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003VPT5U2" id="B003VPT5U2-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-01-25:</strong> the PhoneDevil matte screen protector does protect the screen, yet once again I am disappointed. the protector is seriously sub-par on durability. I have used so many different screen protectors on my iPhone 4S now I don't know where to turn. It's as is every Tom, Dick, and Harry are now producing screen protectors and none of them really know what they are up to.Pros - it does protectCons - after a VERY short time, the protector itself was very marred and scratched. I am not that bad to my phone, not sure what the deal is - I am very disappointed.UPDATE:- VERY shortly following my review, the founder of the company gave me a call and asked me about the difficulty I am having with the product. I have increased my review by one star simply due to the level of customer service and have agreed to give it another shot. I will update as soon as I receive and have a chance to try out once again.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003VPT5U2" id="B003VPT5U2-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-31:</strong> I just received these matte screen protectors yesterday and applied one to my iPhone 4S.  After seeing a friend of mine who had a Zagg branded matte protector and bragged about not having to wipe off fingerprints, I decided to try one out for myself.  I'm not a fan of Zagg products (had one on a Palm Pre years ago and it turned yellow on me) so I ordered the PhoneDevil version instead since it's the highest rated on Amazon.  After many years of owning smartphones I've become a pro at installing screen protectors, getting this one on with no bubbles was a cakewalk (clear scotch tape is your best friend).  All of the holes lined up well, the cuts seem very clean, no weird edges.As far as the look the matte protector goes there is definitely some "pixellation-like" screen distortion as documented in the product description.  Not that it makes the screen unreadable, but it is more than noticeable if you are used to having a clear protector or none at all.  For me, this is not a bad thing as it is a tradeoff.  Fingerprints do not smudge up my screen anymore and glare from indoor lighting is no longer an issue.  After a few hours of using my iPhone with this protector on, I've gone from a middle-of-the-road reaction to loving it, and here's why : it makes the screen look and feel like electronic paper.  It has a very neat texture and the "graininess" of the matte finish gives the screen a paper-like look.  This probably won't work for everybody, but I find it very enjoyable to use.Overall very happy and pleasantly surprised by this product.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003VPT5U2" id="B003VPT5U2-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-07-24:</strong> I have tried every type of screen protector for my iPhone and even went naked for a while because the ones I used in the past ended up peeling off or getting dust underneath AFTER a week.  I wanted that extra protection on my phone as well as something that would help with the glare on the screen when outside so I did some researching and I can to either the SGP or PhoneDevil.  Now I have used SGP before so I was taking a chance when I ordered this and I am greatly surprised!  This screen protector is perfect if you are looking for one that will reduce SOME glare and stop from messy fingerprints.  You will see the actually protector on the screen but that's a side effect of wanting one that will prevent glare and fingerprints.  If you want one that you will not see, I recommend looking at the crystal clear version.  This package comes with 2 screen protectors, a QUALITY microfiber cloth, an installation card, and instructions.  My recommendation is follow the direction in the video on PhoneDevils website and it will be much easy to install.  Came out perfect on my screen and I wish I had bought this one sooner!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003VPT5U2" id="B003VPT5U2-review19" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-07-01:</strong> Very happy with the feel of it and it looks pretty good.

The protector has a nice matte finish that doesn't pick up fingerprints or oil while adding a nice feel to your iPhone. I am very happy with this product. I would recommend you wipe your screen down with a clean hand towel or washcloth wetted with a small amount of rubbing alcohol; this seems to get you the cleanest possible surface. So, wipe down with alcohol and then polish with the included microfiber cloth, then smooth the protector on with the included card and presto, no bubbles.

It was great at first but then over the last few weeks, the fingerprints got harder and harder to wipe off. When I first got it, fingerprints would wipe off pretty easily but I guess after time, you're also wiping the oleophobic coating off also. I loved the clarity but couldn't deal with the fingerprints anymore. So I read the reviews for the PhoneDevil Matte Clear sreen protector and decided to give it a shot. For the price, what could I lose.I got the package in 2 days - Amazon Prime :) and was a little nervous about all that I read about matte screens and how they ruin the great retina display. Installation was very easy. I've installed screen protectors many times so I think I have the hang of it. Using the tape trick to grab little dust particles is always helpful. After the install there were zero bubbles and it was a perfect fit. After about 1 week of use, I've gotten use to the matte coating. It does take some time but I actually like the look of it. It just looks clean. It does take away a little bit of the display brightness but it's hard to explain. I don't mind it at all. You can still see fingerprints but they aren't as obvious. For any of you that have a clear protector or don't have one at all know how the fingerprints can be pretty nasty. With the PhoneDevil matte protector, those fingerprints don't show up the same way. That's also a bit hard to explain. You should really just try it out especially if the fingerprints kill you everyday. But do keep in mind that the matte display will take some getting used to or you'll either love it or hate it. I for one used to hate it, but love it now since I don't see the fingerprints and also no more glare!! I loved it so much that I bought a matte protector for my iPad 2!! Looks great on that also!!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003VPT5U2" id="B003VPT5U2-review29" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-04-06:</strong> Like other reviewers, I am experienced in installing screen protectors on 5 iphones and an ipad.

I prefer my iPhone without them but I apply the matte variety because I use my iPhone in the Magellan car cradle for GPS purposes and I hate the glare coming off the screen.  It's also really nice to not have to deal with cleaning off the screen constantly because of all the fingerprints that are left behind.  I don't like gross, smudgy screens!  I've tried the cheapies that run you a few bucks and come in packs, and all I can say is - you get what you pay for.  I agree with the excellent reviews out here for this product -- it goes on super easy, minimal air bubbles that can be quickly and efficiently squeezed out using the tools they give you, and it applies very smoothly on the screen.  I'm so used to fighting screen protector application and having to go through a few before I get it right, and I had this one on my iPhone in a matter of minutes - first shot - and was very pleased with the outcome!

Mostly 3gs's and a couple of 4s's.I've tried a number of screen protectors - Even the highly rated Zagg.Phone Devil - Be advised that there IS a learning curve to putting these guys on.  Getting them on strait and bubble-free DOES take a little learning.That said - Phone Devil is BY FAR the #1 screen protector.  I have installed about 10 of them, the last 5 or so PERFECTLY.  I won't buy anything else.The major "trick" to getting these guys on bubble-free is to make sure your device is VERY CLEAN when you apply it.  I recommend a specialized cleaner - I use "iKlear" myself.  Then, it's a matter of putting the top on VERY CAREFULLY to get it aligned perfectly.  Then gently pull the bottom sheet off as you use the card to bring it down to the bottom.  Don't worry about a few bubbles.  This is NORMAL, UNLESS the bubbles have a speck in them.  That would be dust and you have to start over as you will NEVER get that bubble out.  Again, I stress - CLEAN screen upon application and CLEAN HANDS - Do NOT touch the sticky side of the Phone Devil.  Also, work in a dust free environment as much as possible.The little bubbles left at this point can be removed with the card.  BE PATIENT - this step takes a LOT of work pulling the strait-edge over the bubble to slowly get it out the side of the screen.After that - LET THE DEVICE SIT for a couple of hours before you put on any other protective case.  This allows the sticky side to "set" - Also, super small bubbles may disappear on their own after a couple of days.Once again I say - Once you get the "knack" of putting these on - Phone Devil is THE #1 screen protector to buy.  That's MY opinion.- Ron Donofero*Edit*  We're now on almost ALL 4s iPhones.  I just installed Phone Devil on my Daughter and Wife's iPhones.  I have a few more on order to install for friends.  NOTE - Installing these things perfectly takes PATIENCE - and you may need to use more than one per phone if you make a mistake (usually that means the work environment isn't sufficiently clean!).  That said, this is the BEST screen protector on the market.  I re-iterate on my installation suggestions:1.  CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN - Make sure the iPhone glass is SUPER clean.  I use iKlear myself.  Be sure to spray some on your fingers as well.  Clean the iPhone screen using iKlear sprayed onto a micro-fiber cloth - rub the cloth thoroughly over the iphone.2.  Wait about 5 minutes for the iKlear to evaporate off the surface.  Use the DRY micro-fiber cloth that came with Phone Devil to clean off the screen.3.  Install the protector using the method I describe in my original post.  Alignment is CRUCIAL - try not to touch the glue-side with your fingers, but get that baby on STRAIGHT - the oval speaker and Camera hole at the top are good for aligning purposes.4.  PATIENCE - PERSISTENCE - Persistently use the card to remove bubbles.  Mainly from the edge.  Do this while the adhesive dries for at least an hour (unless you have a bubble free install - most unlikely).5.  WAIT WAIT WAIT - Your screen looks GREAT at this point.  But if you put external phone protectors on now, you risk the edges pulling up and creating bubbles.  Give the protector at least an hour to "cure" - THEN put on your other impact protection.  More than an hour would be much better.I'm being very specific, which may SCARE some people - Do NOT be afraid.  It's easier than it may sound.  A bit of patience and persistence WILL pay off.  These are the BEST screen protectors on the market - and despite my lengthy instructions, are probably the easiest to install.- Ron Donofero</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003VPT5U2" id="B003VPT5U2-review42" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-02:</strong> I used these for my 3GS.

I decided to give this MediaDevil a try based on mostly positive reviews. I knew that even the best protectors aren't going to be easy to apply and that if you mess up once, the protector is trashed and unusable, which has happened to me with some other brand protectors.It really is a bit tricky to apply the protector very accurately. One has to be patient and apply it with great precision to make it worthwhile and that's always the problem with products such as these. That being said, I gave this one a go and I'm very, very happy with the results. I was able to apply the MagicScreen aligned perfectly at the first go on my new white iPhone 4S without any air bubbles or dust getting underneath.I can honestly say that this is the first screen protector I've tried that looks and feels better than without the protector at all. The screen is just as clear but without the glare and is just as responsive to the touch and actually feels smoother than the naked screen. I've used the protector for two weeks now and there is nary a smudge on it when before without the protector I've had to wipe the screen at least a few times per day to remove the smudges which, as another reviewer pointed out, is rather disgusting to look at.I highly recommend this product to anyone who has an iPhone 4/4S. After trying this out for a few weeks I decided to order more for my wife's iPhone 4S as well and have been heartily recommending it to other friends who recently got the 4S. I really can't ask for more from a screen protector. One just has to be very attentive and careful when applying it. But once you have it on there properly you'll totally forget it exists and not have to worry about fingerprints, smudges and scratches again.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003VPT5U2" id="B003VPT5U2-review50" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-09-14:</strong> Let me start by saying that I'm lucking they include 2 screen protectors with this order because I royally botched the first one.

More convenient that way.-Touchscreen: Not as responsive nor as user-friendly and intuitive as the iPhone, but definitely usable, stylus (which is provided), and finger-wise. Sharp, bright colors, with an auto-adjust function that works amazingly well, even in bright sunlight. Slightly recessed, so it does collect dust and other debris (which I found surprisingly annoying, since even lint easily picks up from my pocket), but overall, very attractive and usable.-Windows Mobile 6.1: Though there are still some bugs, a marked improvement over the last version.  The one really annoying aspect of the system is still the slow loading time, and the main nagging thing I noted is that there's a HUGE lag after text messaging, after the message informing you that the text was sent.  The system freezes for a good 5-10 seconds, and won't let you do anything during that time frame.  Mostly just annoying, though certainly not a detractor, especially if you don't text a whole lot.-The keyboard: Spacious, despite the compactness, and slightly curved, with an assisted spring mechanism that feel very, very solid.  The one qualm I have is that they keys are nearly flush with the tray, and the top row can be difficult to press, since it's nearly flush beneath the screen.  Other than that, with some use, it's easy to get used to, and doesn't add bulk or awkward feeling to the phone, like some full QWERTY keyboards. The keys are also backlit, which is a nice touch, especially in shadowed or darkened areas.-The keys: There's plenty of softkeys and shortcuts available, and they're very well-suited for the phone.  There's an optical joystick (passing your finger over the surface allows you to scroll without physically pressing the top/bottom keys, or the screen), which also serves as an "OK" key.  I really liked that addition to the phone, since I'm not a big trackball fan, and the sensitivity is customizable, since a too sensitive setting can sometimes lead to wrong commands. There's a dedicated panel key, which is somewhat like a home-screen key, since it takes you to the main panel selection every time. There are also dedicated phone keys, a toggle on the side for volume, and a power/sleep button on the top.  They don't detract from the phone, and the only sticking point is that they're sometimes a bit stiff to press.  Other than that, it's a nice, somewhat comforting feeling to have dedicated keys available, unlike the iPhone.-The panels: These have been touted as, and are, really, the main attraction of the phone. They're are an interesting, very positive feature, since they're customizable (you can even move them around, though this has to be done through choosing a panel and editing it, instead of just dragging it across the screen, which would have been much more intuitive), and varied, and give the Windows system a more personal feel. They can be a bit laggy, but they're fun and functional (the fish panel is just amusing, with the ability of the fish to change color, follow the touch, or swim away if pressed), though I've yet to find a use for the Google page, since it always defaults to Internet Explorer, which I don't utilize.-Internet browsing: Pretty snappy and speedy, even on the Edge network.  The area in which I live doesn't support the 3G bands on this particular phone (I have the overseas Xi, while the U.S. will ship the Xia), though bigger cities with the 1900mHz towers do.  I don't use Internet Explorer, since it's still one of the most useless and dated mobile browsers out there.  The phone is shipped with Opera Mobile 9.5 installed, which works similarly to Safari on the iPhone, though thankfully the cut and paste options are available, unlike the iPhone.  (Trust me, after you've given up that option, and then come back to it, you'll really notice the difference.  Why Apple hasn't picked up on that yet, I'll never know...) There is also the option of downloading Skyfire, which works very well, sometimes faster than Opera.  Both platforms support Flash, and display the full-page layout, like you'd see on your PC.  Either way, pretty enjoyable experience there.-Text/Multimedia Messaging: Windows finally incorporated the threaded conversation for text messaging, much like the iPhone did, creating a more "IM" feel to conversations, and making it much easier to keep track of specific conversations.  It lags a bit, as mentioned prior, but a great improvement, without a doubt. It also does Multimedia messaging, and for that alone, in some ways, it is worth more than the iPhone, since Apple still refuses to include that basic function.-Camera/Video/Music: The camera is 3.2 MP, a very decent camera, especially considering the phone size.  It includes a flash, and can be adjusted for various speeds, colors, effects, etc.  There is also a video-camera, which records up to 30fps, though only 24fps, I believe, for the American version.  Why the difference, I couldn't say.  The music player is easy to access (it has it's own panel), and there is also a Sony FM radio included, which is a nice touch, and easy to use, though only with the headphones included, since they act as an antennae, apparently.  Still, very decent media package.-Construction: I have the silver finish, which is really just stunning.  It's very has a very durable, solid feel to it, though can be somewhat slippery, and feels very comfortable in the hand.  The size in my opinion is perfect, compact and sleek, and though this means smaller screen size and somewhat cramped keys, it's really my favorite aspect of the phone.  Has the old, comfortable handset feel of a Nokia candybar phone, actually. Sony really put a lot of thought and effort into it, and it shows.-Other features:  The 3.5mm headphone jack is WONDERFUL.  I had a Sony a few years back, and the one sticking point that kept me from using it as a full-time MP3 player was the fact that I was supposed to use Sony's headphones.  The fact that Sony has branched out, and incorporated the headphone jack, along with the capabilities for a Micro SD card slot (located on the side, when you remove the back cover), really shows that they're creating a platform which is more friendly to users who branch between companies. (Sony usually has their own M2 storage card, which is more pricey than the Micro SD.) Whether it lasts or not depends on their continued association with HTC, I suppose, who designed and helped create the physical phone. I suspect that if they next phone doesn't run Windows Mobile (which has been rumored), those features might disappear. Oh well.  The fact that they're included on the Xperia is really a very nice, convenient touch. The phone also connected with the network very easily, loaded all the information, and formatted the phone, without any heavy programming from me, which was awesome.Overall?  Fantastic phone, with very reliable software, convenient system, sleek and sturdy construction, speedy network connections (even overseas), and plenty of opportunities for personal tweaks and modifications, given the open platform from Windows.  I'd love to give it five stars, instead of the four, but the price was ridiculous, especially considering that it's really just another Windows Mobile smartphone, albeit better-looking and more personal than some others.  Still, it's without a doubt my favorite phone to date, when combining the ease of use and construction appeal.  Well worth buying, if you can burn the money.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001HSMHGO" id="B001HSMHGO-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2009-06-17:</strong> I got this as a replacement to my ATT Tilt. I also have a Sony W880i which I really like. I picked this one up for slightly below $600. While the build quality on this phone is fantastic compared to the ATT Tilt, in all other respects it is almost identical to the Tilt, albeit with a much better screen.I also have an itouch, and I have to say the itouch multimedia capabilities really blows my Xperia out of the water! I am mentioning the itouch here since I guess that is what the iphone must be like as well.The problem here is the Windows mobile OS which has a terrible touch screen interface. Also, my phone requires rebooting on a daily basis especially if I browse the web.Overall there is nothing wrong with this phone. If you're looking for a great Windows Mobile phone this is probably the best. However, with other smart phone choices such as Blackberry, Nokia and iphone I am not sure the OS here holds up to the competition. This phone like my Tilt has great stats on paper, but the implementation is what really matters and that is where Microsoft has let the product down.Just to be clear, I am not a Sony or MSFT basher. I love most of my sony products - and I own a lot of them, but this isn't really worth it to me and I would not recommend this to anyone who is willing to look at a non MSFT Smartphone OS.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001HSMHGO" id="B001HSMHGO-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2008-12-08:</strong> Easy to Google for benchmarks and details, as with the Tilt, this is another HTC/Qualcomm device with well-documented, inferior multimedia capabilities compared to other (Samsung, LG, Toshiba, Apple, Nokia) devices.  Current Qualcomm cpus have been well-documented to be slower than even circa 2002-2003 PocketPC devices when it comes to multimedia.  It's unfortunate a class-action law suite hasn't panned out.Even with the poorly received CLIE NX/UX keyboards, Sony hasn't improved their design.It also doesn't help that this device was delivered with cracks in the casing so the whole first-batch of the US launch was recalled.  Now what was a Nov 28, 2008 launch has been "back-ordered" until January, 2009.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001HSMHGO" id="B001HSMHGO-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-05-31:</strong> Here is a review of the Xperia X1. I have owned the X1, HTC Touch Pro2, HTC HD2, Nokia E90, Nokia E72, Nokia N95 and Apple iPhone. Other than the iPhone, I really hate this phone.1) Build Quality - the plastic on this phone peeled off everywhere! The finishing on this phone is very susceptible to friction. The plastic chrome will peel off. The paint on the metal battery cover will scratch or peel off. The internal housing will crack. It's like the device had an earthquake and cracked itself. I didn't even sit on the device or drop it on anything. There is no way to prevent the plastic from cracking and peeling. All of this happened within 6 months.The keyboard will also loose sensitivity. Over time, you will have to press on the keys harder and harder when you want to type something. The keyboard will only satisfy you for a year. And on top of that, the keyboard sucks. Don't even think about speed typing on this bad boy.2) Efficiency - the phone is very inefficient. The terrible feedback on the keyboard forces me to use the virtual keyboard on the phone. On top of that, the screen is so small that using the virtual keyboard is a nightmare. This prevents me from being efficient with contact management and note taking. In deterred me from actually using the calendar and responding to text messages and emails. Unlike on the E72, I was not motivated to be organized with the software.The phone is also very, very slow. Even with the latest firmware, it is very slow. This made me abhor using this phone for any reason. Don't even think about installing software that runs in the background, because it will eat your battery and retard your phone. The only way to make the device run at decent speeds is to minimize the software and the ROM.3) Battery - the battery life is terrible. It only lasts 12-15 hours on standby without 3G enabled.4) Camera -  the camera doesn't beat the N95, but it's alright. The camera software is sluggish and is very uncomfortable to use. The camera has bad auto focus and weak flash LED.5) Multimedia - the speakers on the phone is very weak so don't even bother watching movies or listening to music. Since this is a touch screen device, the screen isn't big enough for me to enjoy videos or web-browsing.The sluggishness of this device also applied to it's Wi-Fi. That's why I avoided web-browsing altogether. It was just plain terrible. In fact, I prefer the Nokia E90 or Nokia E72 for web-browsing (they are non touch screen phones).6) Phone - the call quality and loudness was at least better than my Nokia E72. However, the X1 speakerphone can't even compare to the E72 speakerphone. Please recall that phones usually have two separate speakers: the speakerphone/loudspeaker and the normal speaker. Well, the X1 has a very bad speakerphone/loudspeaker.8) Internet - the internet is slow, the screen is small, and the CPU needs an update. This should conclude everything.9) Price - at 800 U.S. dollars, it was an expensive piece of junk. But now that it is sold for 400 dollars brand new, it's a little more forgiving.10) Something to consider - regardless of all of the cons I have provided, I enjoyed using the phone because it was highly customizable. Unfortunately, it lacked everything I expected from what was advertised: an awesome keyboard, perfect build quality, fast processor. I tried to make the best of it by customizing it with software and 'tricks' and that alleviated some of the pain. Also, so many people complemented on the beauty of my X1.11) History on X1: When the X1 first came out, all of the reviewers gave the phone high marks for it's amazing build quality. Within a year, everyone noticed that its cosmetic and physical condition deteriorated greatly. The phone reviewers returned the X1 to the 'lenders' before they got the chance to witness the true nature of this phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B001HSMHGO', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B001HSMHGO', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B005OLN18S</h2>    <p class="price"> $B005OLN18S</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005OLN18S" id="B005OLN18S-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-28:</strong> Great case and great fit it just wasn't my style.

It fits snugly, all the buttons are accessible, and it even comes with a screen protector - that's a lot better than some $30+ cases I've tried! It's a good product, however, it is just about the cheapest case you can get.The clear casing looks and feels a little cheap (but maybe the black, white, etc. colors look a little better). It also seems like this case will provide only the minimal amount of protection from scrapes and minor falls. But really, from a cost perspective, this case s a great deal. You can easily find more expensive cases that are equivalent to this case.So, if you just want an inexpensive, basic case, then this one is definitely the right choice. If you want one that looks, feels, and protects more, then you'll have to shell out a bit more money elsewhere.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AR8Z0J6" id="B00AR8Z0J6-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-14:</strong> This case is clear which allows you to display the Apple logo as well as to showcase the beauty of the iPhone 5 itself.

None of those concerns materialized.  The screen protector was easy to install (no bubbles at all) and it fit perfectly with all cut outs fitting perfectly.  The case itself is made of clear hard plastic.  It fit iPhone 5 great, it snapped on snugly and showcases my wife's white iPhone in a clean and attractive way.  the sides of the case extend sufficiently above the screen glass to provide protection if the iPhone is placed face down on a surface.  Overall, this is a nice iPhone protection kit and a very good value.To install the screen protector without bubbles, I cleaned the screen of the iPhone of fingerprints and dust very well.  I removed protective film 1 from the screen protector, and, while holding the protector by its sides, I put it under running water to make the sticky side wet.  Then, I aligned the bottom of the screen protector with the bottom of the phone making sure it fits properly around the button.  Then, while making sure the edges of the protector run parallel to the edges of the screen, I started lowering the protector onto the screen trying to have as few bubbles as possible and ensuring that any bubbles are closer to the edges than to the middle.  Once the protector was applied, I squeezed the remaining water and bubbles from under the protector with the included soft card and a paper towel.  At this point all bubbles were gone, and I removed the protective film 2.  I use this method with all screen protectors of this type and it always works very well for me.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AR8Z0J6" id="B00AR8Z0J6-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-28:</strong> I don't really think three stars is a bad thing on a product like this. That's almost kind of what the AmazonBasics line seems to aim for. It's a really basic product without a lot of fuss or frills that just gets its job done.In this case, it's just a little clear plastic case that fits the iPhone 5 (and will presumably fit the 5S, based on how Apple normally handles its updates) very very well. It gets on there well enough and it's thin enough that it pretty much just feels like holding the phone with no case at all.This is basically good for you if you really want to maintain the look and feel of the original iPhone 5. It'll protect from general scuffing and scratching, but it doesn't have the extra cushioning that could help a phone survive an impact. Still, if you purchased a phone insurance policy and you don't have to worry much about it, or you're just good at not breaking your electronics, this is nice because it lets the device look good instead of taking over.The case itself does seem like it's going to tend to accumulate some little scratches. Of course, it's cheap enough that you can replace it without being heartbroken, so that's not such a big deal.You would also be able to easily pair this with a completely different screen protector if you wanted different features from that (like matte to reduce glare or the privacy ones).The price is extremely good. It fits and holds onto the phone extremely well. For people who aren't too worried about breaking their phone entirely by dropping it or something, it's really very good.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AR8Z0J6" id="B00AR8Z0J6-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-15:</strong> This phone case is super cheap. I mean that in both ways -- a) it's priced low (under five bucks right now) and b) it's about the most basic phone case you can get.It's a thin shell of clear polycarbonate that clips onto your phone. Combined with the included screen protector film (separate piece), it provides decent scratch protection.To me, scratches and other superficial stuff are much less critical than component / screen damage and cracks due to dropping the phone. A hard plastic case like this may offer some protection, but I'd rather use a material with more give. TPU cases are very nice, as are theSPIGEN SGP SGP10088 Slim Armor Case for iPhone 5 - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Metal Slate, which are a little more stylish than the generic appearance of most TPU material cases.Honestly, I'd rather use no case at all than this one.

Don't expect a great deal of drop protection, but as for scratches and small scuffs and dings, this should be helpful.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AR8Z0J6" id="B00AR8Z0J6-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-28:</strong> This Amazonbasics "Protective Cover for the iPhone 5" is a very basic case and as actually a fairly good value for what you get, but it seems somewhat counter intuitive to use a "value case" on a very expensive and somewhat delicate iPhone 5.

By now I've learned how to apply these types of screen protectors without getting bubbles.The deal is outstanding, a very good offer considering it includes shipping.  The case is more durable than the old one, I think because it's made of a better composite.I'm not sure I'd recommend this case to many because those with an iPhone 5 usually will want a rubberized and more expensive case.

Made of hard plastic, it offers decent protection and it comes with a plastic screen cover. I may be a little jaded, but my higher priced Spiegen case (which was also a freebie through Vine) offers more cushioning by comparison and has a few add'l features. However, given its price this may be just the right case if you need a case and don't want to blow the budget. Given the current price of the iPhone5, buying a case to protect it is a smart move and I see nothing negative about this case.

My wife and I have tried a number of cases for our iPhones and this simple solution hits all the right bullet points:-- The case doesn't add unnecessary bulk (it's a form-fitting clear plastic shell that snaps onto the back and sides of the iPhone 5)-- It comes with a screen protector that doesn't reduce the touchscreen functionality or hurt readability-- It's cheap (iPhone cases are meant to absorb damage when you drop the phone so sooner or later they ALL break and you'll need to buy a replacement case ... so don't pay more than you have to)-- It preserves the "look" of the iPhone 5 (this doesn't matter to many people but some people like the iPhone to look like an iPhone even when it's in a case, and this case does just that)If the key talking points I've mentioned above sound good to you then I'd strongly recommend this case. The only thing this case isn't good for is EXTREME rugged protection: If you plan to take your phone fishing and might drop it in the lake or if you frequently drive over phones with your car then this is not the case for you.

And it's clear so your phone looks like... the PHONE. Boom, SOLD!Ok, so, there are some character flaws. The plastic is cheap! Like, splintery cheap. As in, if you drop the phone on a hard textury surface (street), you may put a nice ding on the case. You might even cause the plastic to have a nice sharp scratch splinter that scrapes the crap out of you. Yeah, it hurts.  It draws blood. Ouch. As in,"Ouch! WTF was that??" Did I mention it's only $5? I did? oh. But did I mention that the case comes with a SCREEN PROTECTOR!?? No?  IT DOES!!!!!!!!!! $5. Yeah. Buy one, no buy ten!There is another flaw that should be mentioned: it DOESN'T protect the top and the bottom of the phone. Your phone will get scratches there because there's no plastic covering there. Now if this was a $6 case it might have that bit of plastic on the tops and bottom, but nope.

The "color options" boxes change more than just the color, they change the type of cover you get.  While most of the covers are made of TPU, the flexible, tough material that most iPhone cases are made from, others are "back covers."  Back covers are made of crystal clear, but brittle, plastic.  They're called back covers because they don't cover the top or bottom edge of the phone, just the sides and back.The crystal clear plastic certainly allows the beauty of the iPhone to be more on display.  The cover is extra thin and as close to invisible as a case can be.  But I wouldn't trust this case to protect my phone on impact with a sidewalk.  Also, the clear plastic scratches easily.  I think this is a good option if all you want is protection from everyday scuffs and scratches.I agree with other reviewers that find screen protectors frustrating.  I put them aside and count on the raised ridges of the case to protect the screen.  This case only provides raised ridges on the sides, not on all four edges like full cases do.Attractive clear plastic or tough TPU?  My big gripe is that Amazon makes the choice confusing by putting their "back covers" on the same page as their full cover TPU cases.

My wife was looking for a replacement for her low end iPhone 5 case and I thought ten bucks was worth gambling on this case from Amazon Basics. This package comes with a clear acrylic hard case and a screen protector. Also included is the little cardboard squeegee that you can use to work out the air bubbles following application.The case itself is your standard middle of the road acrylic. It scratches relatively easy and mine was scuffed straight out of the box. This was irritating but at less than half the price of a typical iPhone case I can't complain too much. It fits snuggly around the iPhone 5 and all buttons are easily accessible. It's lightweight and provides enough clearance where your actual iPhone won't touch any surfaces you would set/drop it on. It's reasonably sturdy, but I would expect a major drop from above the 5 foot range on to a solid surface would probably crack it. This is just a theory I have no intention of testing.The screen protector is a toss-up. I have Ghost Armor on my iPhone 5, which is the comparison I will be drawing. For those who aren't aware, Ghost Armor is that mall kiosk where they put "military grade" coating on all the surfaces of your phone. Depending on the options you select, it ranges from around twenty to sixty bucks. I feel like the Amazon screen protector is a better fit for the phone. My phone has a slightly wider, unprotected, edge around the screen protector than the Amazon protector. I haven't had any issues with mine becoming scratched in that unprotected part, I just thought that it was interesting. The Ghost armor is clearly more durable and thicker. The difference is extremely evident just by feeling the two. The Ghost armor feels a bit rubbery (it's supposedly "self-healing") and the Amazon protector is just like a glossy sticker. Will they both protect against scratches? Yes. Can the Amazon version withstand a machete strike from a Navy Seal? I doubt it, but (regardless of what they'd have you believe) I doubt my Ghost Armor can either...The only other aspect I have to add is that the Amazon protector seems to be peeling up from the top corner already which is disappointing. At the end of the day this is probably the best iPhone 5 case you will get for ten bucks or less. It does the job and doesn't hide the aesthetics of the phone. If you're on a budget and need something to protect your iPhone, I can recommend this product from Amazon Basics. However, there are better cases and ways to protect your iPhone 5 if you're willing to spend a little extra cash.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AR8Z0J6" id="B00AR8Z0J6-review31" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-01:</strong> I like the look of this case and it is pretty durable.

I typically switch phones monthly, amongst all the high end smart phones. I like to try different ones, and have had every high end Samsung phone, GS2, GS3, GS4, Note 2, etc. and also the HTC one, LG Optimus G pro, Nexus 4 etc. also, all my house TVs are Samsung smart Tv's and I often like to project my phone videos and pics onto the 55" TV in the den. (much like Samsung phones)I use a galaxy note 8.0 tablet for car and home etc.I typically switch phones b/c I don't believe there was one phone that had exactly what I want...although each had "some" good stuff to add.Now, I believe that a phone is a computer..with phone abilities. I'm not alone in this. I'm NOT the guy who says all phones nowadays work fine, and there is no need for improvement or speed increases. I run 2 companies, have a child, and have a hobby competing in dance events on weekends. I often use my camera for video, pics, and watch videos on my phone. I am not a gamer kid. I rely on my phone to be fast, effective, and the software should make it easy for me to operate a business and be dependable with the ability to jot things down quickly, send emails and share stuff often. And I should be able to communicate...AND NOT RUN OUT OF BATTERY too soon.So, here goes my take on the G2. (I'm on Tmobile)I have used the G2 for about 4 weeks now. I try out almost every feature and see if it's useful for my purposes. I consider it a better phone than the Galaxy S4, and by preference better than the HTC One. I do consider the HTC one to be an amazing phone of all my choices. Great job HTC.Screen:The screen size is huge relative to the size of the phone itself. I think all phones should be this way. I felt like we should be carrying almost all screen without the extra bulk...and the G2 finally provided that. The extra border is useless to me, and just makes for a bigger device in my pocket and hand, with unusable area. The screen is beautiful. Daylight viewing is much better than all other phones accept the HTC One. I can see this thing clearly in very bright outdoor situations, I can't say that about Samsung GS4. The screen is a pleasurable experience. 5.2 inches doesn't bother me. I'm average size. I could have been just as happy with 5" with no border. Either works. I will say that the Official quick window case makes me like the phone 10x more. The case is super thin, but adds function and protection. The china knockoff cases are too thick for me.I feel that 5" and 5.2" are acceptable screen sizes. I was happy with the HTC One (4.7") but watching videos were just too small for my taste.BRIGHT WHITES: I prefer this. And LG hits it right. I enjoy that part of apple devices actually. Clean and bright. LG has that for me.Build Quality:I give it a 10/10 for a plastic phone. Super sturdy and feels solid in the hand. No creeks and cracks like the cheap Galaxy S4. Samsung gave plastic phones a bad name. LG makes it's plastic phones with quality feel. Now, I do not care for the plastic material in terms of being a little slippery. I use the quickwindow case, but wish they would have used a Nexus material for the back cover. Not a deal breaker, but a wish. Not a huge issue for me.Speakers:Not so good. Do the job, but not the best. This is the one area they could have made better, but I assume they ran out of money and had to pick which options mean the most to consumers. Me, I always use Bluetooth (LG HBS730) and don't use the speakers much. I used the HTC one speakers, on occasion, and found they were nice, but not worth the extra " in height to the phone. My preference. I wouldn't want them the extra height.Phone quality:Phone works great. Bluetooth works great. No issues with hearing people with our without Bluetooth. Speaker calls are acceptable when needed.Quick Charging:This phone charges ridiculously fast. They don't tout this feature near enough. I can be at 15%, and plug it in for 20 minutes, and be at 40% with the LG 2A charger (or any 2 amp charger including my car charger). WOW. Now THAT IS a USEFUL feature! A 3,000mAh battery plus quick charging. Much better than HTC and Samsung I used.Battery life:Best of any phone I have used. With a full 1080p screen, and never using "battery saver" this phone has a great battery life. A full 4+ hours better than the GS4, and ridiculously longer than the HTC One. I sync 4 email accounts every 15 minutes and listen to music throughout the day.Lag:No lag. Very quick. Much like the HTC One (which I consider the HTC phone to be very nice in that area)Buttons on the back of the phone:LG placed the buttons (volume and Power) on the back of the phone. They said its more natural than the standard way with buttons on the side: My take? BRILLIANT. It's very nice to not have ANY buttons on the side of the phone, and my grip on the fold is much better holding it the way they recommend. It won't slip out of my hand AT ALL. Very good feature. I hope they keep it with all their future phones. I use the Knock on feature mostly, so I rarely use the back buttons but this was a good move IMHO. If Samsung or Apple would have done this, people would consider it brilliant. It is a good habit and functional.Knock on feature:Great feature. No need for a power button. Works great for me. One secret is when the phone is on, and in an app etc, just tap at the top area twice near the notification bar, to turn it off. (sometimes in an app a double tap activates the app stuff). This alleviates that in that situation.A worthy feature worth keeping. I find myself trying to do that with my Samsung galaxy note 8.0 tablet.LED Light:Love it, works great. Glad they included it for notifications when phone is off. I use it often.Camera:I won't go into a lot of detail here, but I think it's the best camera I have used. Optical image stabilization is a great feature, and the rest of the features are similar to Samsung in terms of modes. I'll let the camera review blogs cover this. I like it and consider it premium. Pics and video are truly amazing on this screen.USB OTG:I like the ability to plug a flash drive into the phone and have access to it to move files or watch movies or whatever. Every phone should have these drivers in their software. And most high end androids do. Apple doesn't. Cables are $3 on Amazon. Use it for business and transferring files quickly.Software:I have used phone software extensively from everyone accept Sony. HTC, Samsung and Nexus etc.Here is my take on using the software for business and pleasure. I like it. Thoroughly.Here is why.Quickmemo: works great. For both screen saves etc. I actually use it a lot. I never really used the Samsung "memo" feature. I prefer Quickmemo being in the notification bar with wifi, Bluetooth etc. I turn it on when I am on the phone and need to jot something down. It quickly saves to my notebook and I'm happy (similar to galaxy note 2,3 notebook without the pen). HTC doesn't have this option for business, and Samsung is lacking (maybe not the note 3 I don't know)VUtalk:Meh. I guess in the rare occasion I had someone with an LG phone I was chatting with, it may be useful. Can't say I use it. It's whatever.Browser:I like the browser viewing experience when on the web. I consider it nice like the HTC One...which I considered the best. Smooth transitions, quick, and not jagged or laggy. Almost up to par with Apple in smoothness. Now, I am a big fan of "whiter whites" and this is where I think the LG shines (along with the HTC One). My one problem with the Galaxy S4, was dingy whites. It bugs me...although I like Samsungs darker blacks. My eyeballs need a bright white like Apple's.Keyboard:On par with HTC One, much better than the GS4 in terms of accuracy (for me anyway). I don't need swiftkey or swype anymore and I get to keep the numbers above the keypad.Basically I like the software adds. The stuff I don't use, I turn off. i appreciate the fact that when I get a text, it shows up in its own little window over any screen I am on. Very non intruding, yet lets me answer texts right then. Works the same when you get phone calls. VERY NICE feature.I appreciate the option to add themes from the stock launcher. (see OG pro themes for freebies on XDA)I also appreciate that I can change the app draw icon size to large. Very nice feature other phones do not have.Lastly, I am amazed and saddened at how the price of this phone has dropped so soon. It's still an amazing phone and I consider the best (note 3 as well)...but without the marketing hype, people don't buy it as much. Which is silly to me.That's it for now, will update when I have time and think of other useful things.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F2SGBXK" id="B00F2SGBXK-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-17:</strong> Pros-1.

It is a fragile fingerprint magnet if you don&#8217;t use a cover.Having used the LG G2 as my primary phone for the last 2 months and a half I think it is enough time to write a fairly competent review of my experience. My experience with the device has been very pleasant. I love the phone, but as with any other electronic device it has its pros and its cons. I will explain with more detail each of the above pros and cons below.Pros (continuation)1. Probably the single most important thing a smart phone needs to have is good performance. In this aspect this phone certainly delivers. It is fast, very fast. It will handle pretty much anything that you can throw at it. I currently have 1 live wallpaper running behind three home screens that have a total of 4 widgets. It still runs flawlessly. The transitions and animations are smooth and lag free. My previous phone was a Galaxy S3 and even though that phone was no slouch you can definitely tell the difference between the S3 and G2. I have seen the biggest improvement in the browser. The G2 is noticeably faster opening tabs and loading pages. It is also smoother when zooming in and out of web pages. As far as games are concerned I have not run many graphic intensive games. I do play a lot of Temple Run (my favorite game) and it runs with no problems.2. Battery life is often times the biggest weakness that a smart phone can have. That is not the case with the G2. Battery life is simply outstanding. I find it almost impossible to drain the battery with normal use in one day. For example, having use the phone for 14 hours today listening to podcasts and music, talking for about an hour, sending over 50 text messages and watching Netflix the battery is still at 60% before going to sleep. By the way, the screen brightness was at 75%. I absolutely hated having to always have to dim the screen in the S3 to have the battery last me a whole day. The only thing that takes a considerably amount of battery is the GPS. An hour using the GPS with full brightness will use about 25% of the battery. Not a big deal if you have a car charger though. Speaking of charging, this phone charges from 0-100% in two hours. Not bad at all for such a big battery.3. One of the most advertised aspects of this phone is its big beautiful display. There is no denying it is gorgeous. Absolutely great if you want to watch videos and pictures. Reading on the phone is comfortable. Colors are considerably toned down from the AMOLED displays on Samsung phones. The pixel count in the display is through the roof making texts incredibly sharp. I have not had any problems with burn in or flickering on the screen. Nothing more to say here, the screen is awesome.4. The camera of the phone is excellent by cell phone standards. There is no way it is going to replace a DSLR camera but it can replace a regular point and shoot. I have not used my regular point and shoot camera in the last two years. The LG G2 takes excellent pictures during the day and decent pictures at night. The pictures come out looking much better at night if you use the &#8220;night&#8221; mode on the camera app. But that can be a hassle when you are trying to take a picture quickly. LG has marketed OIS capabilities of the camera. Honestly, I see this having the biggest difference when I am taking videos. The videos definitely look less shaky than the ones in my S3. When it comes to taking pictures however I don&#8217;t think it really does much though. If I am not careful I still get the occasional blurry picture.5. The phone comes with 32 GB of memory. You can only use about 24 GB out of the box. After installing all my apps, music, taking a ton of picture and videos I still have 12 GB left. The storage is not a problem in my opinion. It is a good thing the base configuration of the phone comes with 32 GB and not 16 GB.6. I got used to the buttons being on the back of the phone after a few hours. It just becomes second nature after that. I actually find the position really comfortable now. I laugh whenever somebody tries to turn on my phone and they spend half a minute trying to figure out how to turn it on. If you are hesitating on this phone because of the back buttons DON'T. They are really no big deal. You might actually like it after a while. Even if you still don't like the buttons on the back you can always use the knock knock feature. That way you don't even have to use them if you don't want to.Cons (continuation)1. The bad thing that comes with having such a big phone is that it makes it pretty difficult to use with one hand. It can get annoying when you are driving and trying to change a song quickly on the phone. I have small hands for a guy but they are not exactly tiny either. The phone itself is pretty thin and it definitely packs the biggest screen possible with the space it has. The borders are very small. Just keep in mind it is still a huge phone, not much smaller than the Samsung Galaxy Note 2. That is great for watching movies but a real pain in the behind if you like using the phone with one hand.2. Having use the G2 the last few months you can definitely tell that the LG software team is not up to par with its hardware. I have experienced a few bugs while using the phone. None of them a huge deal but annoying nonetheless. For example, the knock knock feature should be more like knock knock knock knock. You definitely have to tap more than once to get it to work at times. Also when the knock knock feature is On and I am going to put the phone in my pocket or lay it on a table the phone turns On for no apparent reason. The problem goes away if I turn the knock feature off. But by far the most annoying bug I have had has been with the messenger application. I have had to completely turn the notifications for text messages off. The phone will not turn off the screen if I have the notifications On. It happens with every single text message application on the market which makes me think it is a bug in the operating system itself and how it is handling these notifications.3. This phone has no removable battery or micro SD slot. Not that big of a deal for me but I know many people care about it. It might be a problem in a couple of years if the battery starts giving me any problems and I need to replace it. By that time I figure I have gotten a new phone though.4. I have tried the quick remote feature a few times now. It works with all my TVs and DVDs on my house. The set up was simple enough. The problem is that it just doesn&#8217;t have nearly enough range and you have to point exactly straight at the device you are trying to operate. Often times it doesn&#8217;t receive the command and you have to press it again, again, and again. Very irritating. It is definitely a feature I see using in case of emergency only if I ever lose or break the other remote controls. It is a real shame though because I can see how useful it is to have all your remotes in one.5. When you first get the phone it comes with the LG stock launcher. It is not bad but it is not nearly as good as some other launchers you see on the Play Store. The Nova Prime launcher has less clutter while having more features and customizations. There are no swipe shortcuts in the LG launcher, which is one of the reasons I like Nova Prime so much. The LG launcher is very similar to the Samsung Touchwiz in a lot of ways. When you swipe down the notification panel it has toggles for rotation, wifi, data, Bluetooth, GPS, airplane mode, quick remote, NFC and more. It also has volume and a brightness slide bar so you can adjust them. All of these features in the notification area are very useful but it would be very nice if you could have the option to take them away. You can&#8217;t take them away which makes the notification feel cramped and cluttered.6. The final problem with the phone is that just like with a lot of phones a protective case is a must. The phone is fragile and it will definitely break if you drop it. Not only that, it is also fingerprint magnet. I had my phone two days before deciding it was a mistake to have it without a cover. The phone looks disgusting without a case. You can see the fingerprints from a mile away. The phone feels slippery without a case too. I ended up purchasing the Incipio Dual Pro case. It gives the phone a much better grip and minimizes fingerprints. It also offers very good protection while keeping the phone pretty slim. I highly recommend it.In conclusion, do I recommend this phone? I sure do. Overall, the phone is a fantastic devise. It is fast, has a nice screen and it takes good pictures and videos. The battery lasts all day which is a big plus in my opinion. Unfortunately I cannot it give 5 out of 5 because of all the cons I mentioned above. The biggest problem being the software bugs it has. To be fair though I don&#8217;t think there is a single phone in the market that is worth 5 out of 5 stars. There just isn&#8217;t. There is a lot of pretty impressive competition but you will always find fault with a product if you really want to look at it with an objective view. I really hope this review helped you decide whether this phone is right for you. If you are in the market for a new phone keep an open mind and go to the store to try different phones. There are other options besides Apple and Samsung phones and the LG G2 is certainly worthy competition.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F2SGBXK" id="B00F2SGBXK-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-12:</strong> I chose this phone after deciding to switch to AT&T from Sprint. It is an excellent overall phone with an awesome, bright, clear screen that is large but simultaneously does not make the phone seem huge. I love the &#34;knock on&#34; feature which allows me to turn on the phone without touching any buttons. Additionally it has a feature that detects when you are looking at the phone so that it will not go to sleep while you are reading, etc. It is very fast and I have no complaints so far. AT&T's service is leaps and bounds better than Sprint's in my area which also makes it much easier to enjoy this great phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F2SGBXK" id="B00F2SGBXK-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-18:</strong> Very good. Better than s4 by a mile. Must buy super phone. Faster more powerful than s4. Also awesome buttons on bottom.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F2SGBXK" id="B00F2SGBXK-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-24:</strong> I've been using cell phones since the early 1990s, and smartphones for several years. Samsung, Apple, HTC and others certainly make excellent phones. I know. I've owned and used the iPhone 4s and iPhone 5, Samsung's S2, S3 and S4, and the HTC Amaze. This phone, however, the LG G2, is simply the best I've ever used. The screen is large with a gorgeous, brilliant display. The phone is very fast thanks to the Snapdragon quad-core processor. The battery is not removable, but it's a Li-Po 3000 mAh battery with the prodigious capacity to supply about 17 hours of talk time. I've been using the phone on and off all day and still have about 80% of the power left.  There is no SD card slot. The phone's design is probably too slim and tight to accommodate a card, but it comes with 32 Gigs of internal memory, about 27 of which are available to the user. I've loaded literally thousands of songs, and about 60 video clips along with over 200 hundred photos and I still have seven gigs left. If I want more storage I can always use an external stick. I paid full price for the phone and it was still almost $200 less than the 32 gig iPhone, which also has a fixed battery and no SD card slot.The software LG stuffed into the phone is well thought-out. I hated the problems inherent in the iPhone's small virtual keyboards and the various links and points that had to be poked or drawn with great care to perform simple functions. I also hated the fact that when I spoke on the phone, my ear would inadvertently trigger the address book and sometimes cut off the conversation. No such problem on the G2. The keyboards are actually large enough to use and the helpful guessing at words as you type is very clever and very useful. There are so many things that LG has done with the software, and so many things I've yet to learn, that I can't comment further except to state that there's nothing I've seen in their pamphlets or propaganda that isn't the product of a profoundly wise and practical design team.Finally, there's the sound. None of the "professional" reviews of the LG G2 I've read or seen have delved into it, but the sound through ear buds is utterly superb. The HTC One comes close, but I think the LG G2 has the edge. One or two reviewers commented on the sound of the speakers. Well, the iPhone and Samsung speakers are just as mediocre, but anyone who listens to his or her cell phone speakers for the thrill of the experience is no audiophile. I listen through ear buds when I exercise and when I walk, and what I hear on the G2 is utterly astounding. At home I coupled the G2 with a cheap blue tooth speaker and was so impressed I bought the Bose SoundLink Mini. I listened to both the HTC One, with its excellent "Beats" audio and the G2, and to be frank preferred the G2, at least for classical music. I felt as if I were standing next the Steinway as the marvelous Yuja Wang played Rachmaninoff, or as if I were in the middle of the combo during a Jazz performance. Rock or pop may sound better on the HTC One, although I'm certain the G2 could also deliver anything the aficionados of Pop or Rock would want.I like the LG G2 very much and would recommend it to anyone. To me, it's simply the best value there is in cell phones today.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00F2SGBXK', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00F2SGBXK', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B004X4LN7S</h2>    <p class="price"> $B004X4LN7S</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004X4LN7S" id="B004X4LN7S-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-10:</strong> My daughter love this colorful cover, with very good grip and I think that the phone can be really protected with it</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004X4LN7S" id="B004X4LN7S-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-27:</strong> The skin is great, fits perfect and the texture is really nice...But this Cbus guys are something else!At first I don't recived my skin, This Ups guys just stock it as &#34;not found direction&#34; or something like...And when I thought I wasted my money ...

I currently own 11 cases for my AT&T; iPhone 4. That's right, 11. And that's not counting the ones I've returned. I have been so unhappy with some from the beginning that I returned them. That being said, you could say I'm somewhat of an iPhone case connoisseur. I've tried all different kinds and I'm familiar with most of them...from the Otterbox to this. There are pros and cons to thin cases. For a while I used the Otterbox Commuter (which I did like, for the most part) and then I went to the Griffin Outfit Ice. Those are my top two cases for protection, with the Outfit Ice being my favorite (it has a great feel to it and it's not too thick, but it offers solid protection).But lately I've been more interested in showing off and enjoying the sleekness and sexiness of my iPhone. Enter this case. I always use a screen protector on the front of my phone to protect it from scratches (I use Best Skins Ever because I've found them to be the best quality AND the cheapest...can't beat that). That being said, I like this case a lot. It's plastic and thin...doesn't add much bulk to the phone. It doesn't feel cheap, in my opinion. I've spent 20-30 bucks on cases that felt much cheaper than this one. I want a few different colors now, and for the price I think I can afford to splurge for a few more. Maybe I'll round my collection off at about 15.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00575TN42" id="B00575TN42-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-30:</strong> Great pens for my ipad and iPod.The price was very affordable and it came in nice colors.Overall great.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00575TN42" id="B00575TN42-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-24:</strong> Great price and the stylus pen do what it suppose to do works on my iPad and iPhone keep it clean of finger prints</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00575TN42" id="B00575TN42-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-19:</strong> Haven't really gotten to put the stylus to use but the aqua color is perfect.

This is frustrating. My tiny fingered wife can't figure out the attraction for these.These are very light and handle like a pen, so are very comfortable.  I keep one at work and one at home and one when I lose one, which will probably happen before I wear these out.There is a bit of learning curve to using these, to get a feel for the amount and duration of a press.  You will get a lot more fluid with practice, if you have this issue. This really has speeded up my typing on my smartphone, especially all the error correction going away.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00575TN42" id="B00575TN42-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-07-23:</strong> I am happy with the quality of the pens however the color description was off.

I tried them on 4 products.  It worked great on the Apple iPod Touch v2 and v4, as well as on the Kindle Fire v1.  However, it did not work well with the Blackberry Storm 2 smart phone.  The problem is that the Blackberry Storm 2 has a click screen, and these stylus pens are not strong enough to easily click on the screen, instead of just tapping like on the other devices I tried them on.For the price, I highly recommend these, but only if you don't have a click screen device, like the Blackberry Storm 2.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00575TN42" id="B00575TN42-review75" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-30:</strong> These were cheap and I got cheap. One worked for a day now, I  did drop it, guess by chance it landed on the black tip,  may have punctured it so the device wouldn't respond to it afterwards. I took out the second one and it's working for now, they are wide tipped so, if you are looking for precise use, this is not for you.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00575TN42" id="B00575TN42-review76" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-21:</strong> These work great.

I had read some reviews that said the rubber tips wear down which i guess can be expected, its just the timing as to how long it will take, I use one for My Fire, one for my pad and I have an extra just in case, LOL. They need to find someway to attach it to your item you use it for, it came with some thingy that I have still not figured out what its to do cause its so long and the velcro seems missed placed, not pictures so not sure how to use it, so I dont at the moment, I keep my Fire one in the case it clips inside, but my pad, it just sits on top and I just have to keep an eye for it.

It's pretty simple to install, and I was surprised to find a keyboard cover included, I don't really like it though, it gets rid of the clicky feel of the keyboard so I think I press it when I don't and it also gets rid of the backlight of the buttons. I'll only put it on when I'm not using the computer so it prevents debris from getting under they keyboard.

Despite all the reviews in Youtube from different companies. The phone works great, its incredible fast and it is the last phone with the freedom you need to add extra memory since the new HTC models doesn't have the micro SD slot and not removable battery (or back cover).This phone comes already unlocked from the provider and you don't have to introduce an unlocking code. It comes on its original box (AT&T;), it's brand new but the only issue is that phone doesn't come with earphones. It's not big issue at all, bur it would be great if HTC could include the earphones with microphone.The battery duration might be an issue, so I recommend to buy:- Anker External Battery Pack- Hyperion AT&T; HTC Vivid 4G 2 x Battery + ChargerFor less than $400 USD this is an excellent choice for an android phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006W95VHU" id="B006W95VHU-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-06-18:</strong> Outstanding smartphone.

I picked it because I got a good deal on it, and the reviews were promising.  From a total novice user, I have to say that it is an excellent phone, easy to use with a nice big screen and a fantastic camera.The phone usage is intuitive, and I didn't have any problems getting it set-up.  It connected to the 4G network immediately, and I got it connected to my home WiFi with only a few steps.  It comes loaded with quite a few Apps--I don't know how standard all of these are, since my experience is limited, but there is certainly enough here for me to play with for awhile.The camera is great; it takes better pictures than my Canon PowerShot. The lowlight setting is really amazing, and it is impressive what great night pictures the camera takes.The only problem I have had with the "HTC Vivid" is the battery.  It runs through its battery surprisingly quick.  It barely holds a charge for a single day, and needs to be re-charged as often as possible. I also think some of the button positioning is odd.  The external volume switch is right where you hold the phone during a normal phone call, so I am constantly accidentally muting my phone. That just takes some practice and getting used to though.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B006W95VHU', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B006W95VHU', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00AEK5V5K</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00AEK5V5K</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AEK5V5K" id="B00AEK5V5K-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-11:</strong> It's a good product and especially for people with small hands but the camera is disappointing, the rest of the phone is great though&#60; I bought it for a friend</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AEK5V5K" id="B00AEK5V5K-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-19:</strong> GREAT phone very fast and does all the stuff its big brother does with a form factor that fits in your pocket.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AEK5V5K" id="B00AEK5V5K-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-19:</strong> I bought this as an intro smart phone for my mom.

It sports a smaller 4&#8221; screen with a resolution of 480x800 and is an entry-level phone compared to the more pricy and feature-packed S3.  This phone does not support 4G, which is curious since the S3 does.  It supports 2G and 3G, as long as it works well with your carrier.And this is the part of the review where I state a friendly warning.  The vendor selling this phone states the phone is compatible with GSM carriers, such as AT&T; and T-Mobile.  This may not be entirely true.I purchased this phone while setting up service with T-Mobile here in the US.  I wanted an unlocked phone that my wife could use with our new service.  The vendor sent us a Samsung S3 Mini &#8220;Orange&#8221; phone that originated in Europe and had European firmware installed on it.  While the phone worked fine and upgraded itself properly, we were never able to get any speeds more than 2G with a data speed of about 100Kbps, which is painfully slow.  The smartphone was unable to host any smooth streaming media due to this slow bandwidth.I then learned that the phone does not support the US T-Mobile 3G transmission frequencies.  It will work with T-Mobile, but only at 2G speeds.  If you live in the US and plan to use this phone with T-Mobile as your carrier, expect only to use 2G service.  This may be fine for some people.  If it is, this phone is worth considering.The charger is an international charger that comes with a North American adapter.  The phone comes with a pair of headphones and a battery.  It does not come with an SD card, case, or protective cover, as is typical with cell phones in general.We were able to return the phone and get our money back from Amazon.  Amazon is very good about returns.  While this phone didn&#8217;t work for us and it was advertised to work with AT&T; and T-Mobile, in fairness to the vendor who sold it, they also do say that &#8220;not all carrier features may be supported.&#8221;  You're best to take this into consideration before purchasing this phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00AEK5V5K', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00AEK5V5K', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B002S4Z2NQ</h2>    <p class="price"> $B002S4Z2NQ</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B002S4Z2NQ" id="B002S4Z2NQ-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-20:</strong> Great gadget to have especially for car stereos that doesnt have a port for an auxiliary cable.

It technically 'works'.  It lets you choose any station - I tried several station setpoints with no "real" stations within a few clicks, so I know I wasn't just getting interference.  No matter what it sounded pretty bad to me - as in, much worse quality than the radio.  The lows were the worst, and the sound faded in and out.  I'd rather put up with dull radio selection and commercials than deal with the distortion in this item.  I'm no audio connoisseur/snob, either.  I just like music, and it's super distracting when it sounds off.It comes with a remote that I didn't try out (wasn't expecting the remote).  This product might be OK for certain types of music but I tried a variety of songs from dubstep to bluegrass and was dissatisfied.The sound is still poor, but it is NO DIFFERENT from a name-brand "iTrip" I compared it to.  Reality is, I don't think any FM transmitter can deliver good sound.  At least this one is cheap and works (albeit slowly) as a charger.  I do not use it for listening to music - I got a tape adapter that sounds much better.This thing works fairly well for voice-only podcast lectures, and for charging my phone.  I'm OK with that.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B002S4Z2NQ" id="B002S4Z2NQ-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-07-06:</strong> I have tried the wired FM transmitters and I must say that this one is awesome to be wireless.

I live in the Chicago area, and the radio stations here play nothing but the same crappy pop/hip-pop/classic rock over and over. I can't bear to listen to it. My cable with dock plug that came with my aftermarket radio that attaches to my iPhone doesn't work anymore...I think a wire inside the cable cracked, so I needed a cheap way to get my music off my iPhone thru my car stereo again.  I figured I'd try an FM modulator since they're relatively cheap and easy to use. This unit can be powered just by the iPhone itself, but I found that using the included charging cable while playing music GREATLY improves the signal strength that it emits, allowing your music to sound much clearer with much less static.  There aren't many empty radio frequencies around Chicago for use with an FM transmitter, but it does an acceptable job. I'm sure if you live in an area away from a large city it would work even better. There are websites that you can punch your zip code into and they'll return a list of the best or most "empty" frequencies for you to try.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B002S4Z2NQ" id="B002S4Z2NQ-review21" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-28:</strong> I knew this would be ify at best... the FM transmitters may work great in the sticks.. but around big cities (SF Bay area) it's impossible to find a station that doesn't bleed into the reception on every turn.incredible price, fast shipping, quality product, would order again from this vendor.

I have only had a little static once and that was going by a big radio antenna.  Also, when plugged in the transmitter charges your iphone.  You dont have to have the transmitter plugged in to your AC outlet in order for the transmitter to work which I find convenient.FYI, if you have an Otter box the transmitter wont fit properly and you will have to make some modifications to your otter box with a file.

The remote is alright, more of a novelty, you have to aim it right at the FM transmitter/iPod, not sure which as neither seem to have an IR port</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B002S4Z2NQ" id="B002S4Z2NQ-review27" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-20:</strong> I gave this to my daughter for use in the car and so far working as expected.

Good news is it's so cheap that I may not even bother with the whole returns process because I'd much rather not have to frustrate myself to drive to the local UPS store to mail something for five dollars in returns.  So buyer beware, do not buy through amazon prime. Their return policy requires you to actually return it rather than them shipping out a new one or returning the money.  I will recommend that you buy it from a 3rd party vendor that has a tendency to send out a new one or refund it.  I don't even understand as what will Amazon's warehouse even do with a device that doesn't even work.Now as to why it's so bad or atleast the one that I received is that even next to any fm receiving device I'll get 80% static in noise.  Now curiously enough if I place my hand or any body part on the device the signal will clear up and work perfectly fine as if I was some kind of huge antennae.  Once I lose contact however the signal degrades again (I actually have the same issue with a very old fm radio that doesn't have an antennae hooked up and if I touched any part of it the signal would become crystal clear).  Now I actually did get it to work ONCE but then when I put my iPhone down it would just cause static again.  Now at first I assumed it was my phone's cell signal causing an interference (it never hurts to be careful) so I turned it on airplane mode and tried it again, no luck. Also even with the whole touching the device &#34;solution&#34; didn't perfectly always work.  Out of the whole broadcasting range I was able to find only a couple stations that actually worked (slight exaggeration).  Also of those my device had to be set to one broadcasting frequency higher than what my car or other fm radios were set to which is quite peculiar as if I set it to the actual frequency it would stop working altogether.The remote that came with the device also did not work.  I assumed the batteries were dead and having some of those circular ones lying around I tried replacing it and it still did not work.  But that probably wasn't even the case in the first place since it did come with a plastic insertion that separated the device from the battery when packaged.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B002S4Z2NQ" id="B002S4Z2NQ-review29" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-20:</strong> I discovered these little cylinder-shaped FM transmitters a couple of years ago when they were available for two bucks each from Hong Kong.  While I've since found the Coby transmitter to be the most reliable and stable for transmitting tunes from my iPod Touch through my car radio, I keep a couple of these miniature cylinders for special occasions.  Here are pros and cons:PROS:1.  These are the ONLY, truly "wiresless" transmitters.  All of the others require use of a potentially problematic wire, whether the car has a special input, or receptacle, for a 3.5mm audio cable or, in the absence of such an input, the transmitter must be wired to a charger in the cigarette lighter or to a 3.5mm audio receptacle in the device that's plugged into a cigarette lighter.  The pictured transmitter uses and requires NO wires whatsoever.  (The chargers that are "bundled" with some of these tiny devices are bogus--a way of justifying the price.)2.  In some cases, this transmitter is the ONY viable option, especially if you have your Nano attached to a wristband  on your left band and use it as a wristwatch.3.  When functioning properly, these small transmitters are capable of pulling in a loud and non-distorted signal with no gratuitous background noise.4.  There's never a danger of leaving one in your car's cigarette lighter, where it has the capacity of draining your car's battery by morning.5.  One of these little transmitters can be used to transmit wirelessly to a stereo receiver in your home as efficiently as to a car radio.CONS:1.  Quality control of these small transmitters can be highly variable. The "good" ones have a frequency-changing button on each side of the read-out window; the potentially problematic ones have the frequency buttons piled one on top of the other on the right side of the read-out window.2. They're tiny and frequently not accessible when you need them. Best not to regard even a good one as a long-term solution.3.  Though they don't drain a car's battery, they do lessen the playing time of your iPod or player.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B002S4Z2NQ" id="B002S4Z2NQ-review30" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-06:</strong> I have had this product for about a month. So far I have had no problems with this product at all. It plugs and plays with my iPod with absolutely no problems. The range of frequencies is great. It can go from around 87 all the way to 107. So you can always find an available station. There tends to be some static no matter what station you are on, but if you play your music loud enough you never hear it. Also the charging cord works great, I never have to worry about losing battery power on my iPod. I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a simple FM transmitter for their iPod.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B002S4Z2NQ" id="B002S4Z2NQ-review31" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-24:</strong> I bought this because I am tired of fighting with the wire attached to my Aux in on my head unit when it is attached to my iPhone 4. I really wanted to get aGriffin Technology BlueTrip AUX for iPhone and Smartphonesbut it is a bit pricey. So I opted to try this.To be honest, this unit is a disgrace to my Bose system.The sound quality was not that great, with a lot of static coming through. This is somewhat masked when you are playing music, but if you are attempting to play an audio book or maybe something orchestral you are going to be annoyed. And the bass is majorly lacking when using this unit.The connection did not seem to be consistent. The audio would come through at what seemed to be clear but very frequently static would take over. Especially if you move the phone around.I tried this with many different stations with the same results.This unit will NOT transmit phone call audio to your speakers, which isn't a problem for me, but I wanted to test it so I could let you know if that's what you were planning to accomplish with this unit.THIS IS A BIGGIE AND WHY I GAVE THIS UNIT A LOW RATING:If you do not transmit any audio through this unit for about 15 seconds, it will disengage the connection between itself and the station you are tuned into and screeching loud static will play through without warning until you happen to play something to re-engage the connection.If you don't understand what I mean, let me put it this way... You plug the unit into your iPhone, tune into the station you have set on the transmitter, and the connection is made between the unit and station. Now that the connection is made you hear silence (pending you have a good connection). Now you need to find a song to play. Well you better hurry up and play it within 15 seconds because if you don't the transmitter will go into standby and static will come blaring through your speakers. Quite alarming!Volume control on the iPhone is disabled when the transmitter is connected. Some may think that you don't need volume controls on the iPhone because you can just use the head unit's volume. The problem is, the volume being transmitted seems to have been set low from this device. Even with my head unit volume turned all the way up, it is does not come close to the loudness of a CD, the Radio, or the Aux connection in my car.I really wanted to like this because of all the good reviews and the concept was pretty neat. Plus I HATE wires everywhere! But this thing is useless.I am not an audiophile nor am I picky, but you really cant enjoy music or audio books with this device.I may have to suck it up and go for the Griffin. Either that or I'll just deal with the wired connection, but I will not deal with this.ALSO! Since the price was so good I happened to buy 2 of these transmitters because a buddy of mines CD Player broke in his car with no Aux input. That being said, I received 2 completely different units odd enough. And the one wasn't meant for and did not work with an iPhone 4. The second one was packaged much nicer and it said right on the packaging that it did work with the iPhone 4. The button placement was also different on the 2 units.That being said, if you do decide to purchase this device, this is one of those Amazon orders where 'you never know what your gonna get'. So good luck!Hope this helps!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B002S4Z2NQ" id="B002S4Z2NQ-review32" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-04:</strong> This FM Transmitter does not have the best signal, but it is generally enough to overpower background stations from transmitting.

If you have a tape player in your car like me and want to listen to music from your phone or MP3 player, I definitely recommend using a cassette adapter instead of this dinky thing.

Phone designers spend time and effort making their products beautiful and sleek, then we slap cases the size of a phone book on them.  I never understood that.  This case comes straight from Google, and it looks like it.  Honestly, upon quick glance, it doesn't even look like the phone has a case.  It looks like a part of the phone, beautiful and simple.  It fits securely and works with my screen protector.  All of the ports are still perfectly accessible.  Qi wireless charging works just fine.  And it really doesn't add too much bulk, I actually kind of like the substantial but not over-the-top feel it provides.  And the finish is the same as the Nexus 5 itself - it's that velvety, matte black plastic.  I'm not sure how much protection it will provide, but it has to be better than nothing.  Minus one star because the buttons are indeed hard to push, but I can get over that.  Overall, it's worth the extra money!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GY203DC" id="B00GY203DC-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-02:</strong> I am not sure why this unit is labeled as "Adopted" (what does that even mean?), as it's the exact same product you can buy for $35 at Google Play. Just got mine and it's awesome. Perfect fit and finish (buttons are a little harder to press, but it's not a big deal like some claim). This appears, and is packaged in, perfect Google OEM product. This must be the newer version with wider volume/power buttons (Google that and you can read on it). Works, looks and feels perfect. Finally, I can settle on a case!UPDATE: just checked Google Play and this case is now the exact same price as on Amazon ($26.24). Google is having a 25% off sale, so I guess Amazon matched it :-)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GY203DC" id="B00GY203DC-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-24:</strong> The bumper is made of good material and is very solid.

The only thing I dislike about this screen protector is that it was pretty hard to apply on without getting lint and dust in it. I had to re-align the screen protector a few times since the cut-out for the front facing camera and ear speaker did fit well, but the cut-out for the home button didn't align straight enough so it's a bit off but not that big of a deal. Another little issue is there is a little bubble around the edge of the home button, the instructions say those kinds of bubbles do go away in a few days but it did not, again not a huge deal. This is though, the best screen protector I've used for my iPhone 4 so far, it doesn't leave residue, it's barely noticeable, and hopefully the scratch resistance lives up to it's name. Overall it's a pretty nice screen protector for the price. I think all screen protector companies need to focus more on finding out a way to prevent dust and lint from sticking to the screen protector while applying them, or just find an easier way to add them on quicker. I recommend this.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006JB6XH8" id="B006JB6XH8-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-17:</strong> good product the instructions were in back of the cardboard case which were pretty difficult to understand. however it does the job.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006JB6XH8" id="B006JB6XH8-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-01:</strong> Great product.

The protector is a little smaller than the screen and the home button cutout doesn't line up perfect. The upside is that this allows my case to go on without pushing on the screen protector causing bubbles, which my last different brand protector did. When putting on the screen protector the bubbles were very easy to push out and looks great. The protector does show finger prints and smudges so if this bothers you I suggest getting a Matte protector instead of clear. Fast shipping with Prime.Update: Using these screen protectors for a while now and they have showed great quality. My wife dropped her iphone front screen down in a parking lot and the screen protector absorbed all the shock. When she showed me it actually looked like she cracked the screen in two different areas. When I peeled off the screen protector the "cracks" were actually marks on the screen protector. This showed me that if it weren't for it the iphone screen would have been cracked in those spots. So it saved the screen but I did have to use another Membrane out of the pack to have a clear screen again, which is definitely better than a new screen.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006JB6XH8" id="B006JB6XH8-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-01:</strong> Bought these for my husband and they are easy to install...

I can't read anything on the phone screen for very long with this on - particularly black text on white screens - because of all the blue-ish distortion it adds.  The retina display is drastically reduced with this (again - less clear than a 3GS with a matte protector).  It's cheap for a reason.It is cut VERY closely to the phone's dimensions - so it is quite a task to get it on...and per apple, it is not supposed to cover the area next to the front-facing camera (it's a sensor or something).Too cheap to bother returning...but I spent an hour putting it on & getting the dust out...only to dislike it.

At this price, there is not much else I have tried that even approaches the quality. I have had some screen protectors (invisishield, etc.) that were 15 each, and offered a lesser experience than these.I cleaned the glass, laid it on the edge carefully (actually just inside the edge) and smoothed it out with a C/Card. Practically perfect fit with just a smidgen of space at the very edge. Well done design aspect IMO.After installation on three iPhones, we each had a bubble free, smooth cover for our phones. The look is flat, as in no sheen and thus, nothing annoying reflecting of the surface as you use it for face time, or reading something.Additionally, and this makes such a difference to me, the touch through qualities are great. It reacts more directly with my finger and seems more akin to using the phone without a screen protector on there.Good work Aduro.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006JB6XH8" id="B006JB6XH8-review38" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-11:</strong> excellent product, good packing, and spare protectors for later use or to resell them to your friends! both sides are preaty good, front and back, no complaints at all</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006JB6XH8" id="B006JB6XH8-review39" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-07:</strong> These are some of the best screen protectors I've ever used.

Toward the end of this review I have a tip that my be useful. What you like in screen protector will depend on your preference, so I wrote about my experience.The protector itself offers a clean image without a matte and/or darkened finish, and for me, does not interfere with the touch-screen interface. The anti-glare aspect gives it a glistening or crystalized effect at times, but not to where it blocks visibility. Oil and residue tend to show fairly easily, but it also wipes off easily. The fit around home button, camera, etc is about 95% accurate, but this usually the case with generic protectors. Applying them can be frustrating, but I don't necessarily think it is a product defect, just the nature of living in a world with dust.Tip: I have a method that works for me, but not claiming that it trumps others. First, make sure fans, a/c, etc are all off. When wiping the bare screen before application, I do it slowly b/c I've noticed rapid or intense wiping builds up static electricity. After that I get a handheld vacuum and place it near the phone. When I'm ready to apply the protector, I turn the vacuum on and keep it running until I am satisfied the protector placement. I still get a bubble or two, but they are usually unobtrusive and away from the screen.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006JB6XH8" id="B006JB6XH8-review48" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-03:</strong> I received this pack of Membrane protectors for my iPhone, and I can say that I am satisfied!

At times I find myself missing the sleek glossy look of a standard screen protector. However, Matte screens have their advantages. They don't fingerprint nearly as easily, nor do they reflect the sun as much. The result is a screen that doesn't have to be wiped as often and that doesn't cause as much strain on your eyes in sunny conditions. As far as this particular screen saver goes it's acceptable. The screen protector fit my iPhone 4s very well. Application was fairly easy, although not fool-proof. I have yet to find a screen protector that doesn't bubble. Overall, it's a pretty standard matte screen protector that I was satisfied with.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006JB6XH8" id="B006JB6XH8-review64" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-26:</strong> Nice, thick, membrane and I have been using it for a couple of weeks.

Yes, there's certainly cheaper product but you get what you pay for and what ends up happening later is either frustration of the product failing to protect your screen (it is, after all, what you bought it for right?) or that it's yet another piece of pvc film that attracts scratches like fleas to a dog. The Aduro screen certainly isn't scratchproof but it's thick and durable. What I liked most was that they supplied you with 3 screen protectors, a chamois for cleaning the screen prior to adhesion and well marked tabs. Precision wasn't my forte so and of course if you're in a dusty environment no matter how quick at the draw you are after cleaning the screen there's a decent chance something tiny will land on the screen in between time when you remove the protector and apply the film. For this, keep some scotch tape handy for the clean up job. Use a piece to slowly remove the film and another piece of tape to peel the little bugger off.I'll be upgrading my iPhone soon and have bookmarked this product as I'll be doing this exercise all over again.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006JB6XH8" id="B006JB6XH8-review70" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-15:</strong> If your thinking of buying this item...

I loved these screen protectors so much, I just bought 3 more packages to stock up. Anyone familiar with applying a screen protector understands the agony that can often be associated with such an effort. Typically, you are trying to avoid bubbles under the screen. Another problem is that some protectors are too stiff while others are not stiff enough. This results in misalignment when applying or even more bubbles.  Also, some screen protectors cannot be easily adjusted during the application process.  The Arduro protectors remarkably resolve all these issues.The Arduro Membrane protectors apply very easily.  They are just stiff enough that during application bubbles are easily avoided from the onset.  If air bubbles do result, they aare easily worked out.  Screen protectors not stiff enough tend to have more issues with air bubbles. During application, the screen protector can easily be removed and readjusted if you misaligned during application.  However, once done, the screen protector is incredibly secure with no "edge liftoff" often associated with other types.  The adhesive is truly remarkable.The screen protectors were a perfect fit and crystal clear; very high quality. And like Arduro says, they are trylu ultra clear except for any smudges that may result from your thumb during use.  These are easily wiped off.Seriously, don't spend more when you do not have to.  These protectors are great.  Just understand that these protectors are not the matte type and some reflection, especially outdoors, will happen.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006JB6XH8" id="B006JB6XH8-review85" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-15:</strong> This thing once it's on looks beautiful but I have to admit that it took two tries before I could get this item on, not because of the bubbles but because of the number tabs, you need to use to unpeeled and need to handle to put it on your phone, came apart.

This was fairly easy to put on. I was actually able to remove it and adjust my placement without completely ruining the edges or adhesive. It adheres well to my phone around the home button and earpiece/camera - a problem that I've had with the much more expensive Zagg screen protectors. Aside from a few tiny bubbles (my own fault for not cleaning the screen well enough) you can hardly tell it's there. The included sheet for the back of the phone might not be necessary if you have a case, but my case has a tendency to collect dust and dirt from my pocket which has already scratched the back of my phone, so I decided it was best to use it anyway. Just make sure you THOROUGHLY clean the front and back before you put this on. Spend more time on this than you think you need to because every speck of dust will cause a bubble.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006JB6XH8" id="B006JB6XH8-review91" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-22:</strong> I got this three-pack together with theAduro Shell Holster Combo Case for Apple iPhone 5 with Kick-Stand & Belt Clip (At&t;, Verizon, T-Mobile & Sprint)and it seems ok in my inexpert opinion.  It is however a pain to apply as it can't be lined up with the edge of the iPhone - it's about a millimeter smaller all around.  I'm not really sure why this is as the Aduro's own shell doesn't cover the outer edge of the screen or anything?  Anyway it makes it tricky to apply the protector perfectly, and I wound up with a slight overlap at the front receiver opening.  It's not terribly difficult to reset the protector but there's only so much time I want to spend fiddling with it!!!  It's AMAZINGLY easy to trap dust and lint under the protector...As far as clarity goes, the (matte) protector cuts down on glare but makes the iPhone's graphics very slightly cloudy - though not enough to interfere with visibility.  It does pick up fingerprints, but I feel more comfortable wiping them off the protector than the actual screen...  Anyway I guess I can't complain too much for the price.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006JB6XH8" id="B006JB6XH8-review92" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-14:</strong> The only problem is to install it without bubbles and that the membrane shows all the fingerprints and it is a bit hard to clean</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006JB6XH8" id="B006JB6XH8-review93" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-15:</strong> These have served me well.

These are very easy to apply, they work great on my Verizon iPhone 4S & my daughter's iPhone 4. You just need to be in a bright, dust free room, keep the phone off during application & it's very easy, I highly recommend these!*Update* I accidentally reviewed these thinking they were the Tech Armor Screen Protectors. These were not good. It came with a cheap cloth that couldn't remove dust from anything and a cheap cardboard squeegee. They do line up with my iPhone 4S but unless you want to pay Best Buy or another retailer to put them on, avoid these. I thought they would feel different as well, they didn't.

I installed two of these and the secret seems to be peeling the back just a little and starting the application from the top of the phone and peeling back slowly while sticking the cover on. This cover seems to be cut just right so that it fits and lines up when your phone is in a silicone case because the edges of the case do not make this peel at all.The only issue I have is with the bottom of this cover just below the home button. On both covers the very bottom does not adhere well at all. It's only been a couple of weeks and already there is dust from my pocket that is starting to collect in this area. I even carry the phone upside down in my pocket so that the bottom is upwards, in order to limit the amount of dust that will no doubt build up.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006JB6XH8" id="B006JB6XH8-review105" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-24:</strong> Great screen protector.....I think.....I'll never know.

While that works fine, it just feels a little weird and loose, even though it's not.The sound is fantastic. The voices you hear are loud and clear, and people tell me that headset sounds good on their end.The only real drawback is portability.There's an inline switchbox with controls for volume, mute and a button for call answer/end. It would be nice if these controls could be on the headset itself instead of inline on the wire. The added bulk makes it difficult to just wrap this headset up and stuff it in your pocket. In jacket weather this shouldn't be a problem. But if you're not wearing a jacket, carrying this around is a little cumbersome. I keep it in my laptop bag but if I don't have that with me there's just not a good way to bring this headset with you.That aside, this is a terrific headset with great sound, no bluetooth-is-scrambling-my-brain worries, and a great price.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004F98U8Q" id="B004F98U8Q-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-01-30:</strong> I can barely hear the in-call volume on my HTC Android.

Well, someone who uses Skype on their iPhone that is who! I bought an awesome Plantronics blutooth headset only to find that if you are using Skype for iphone it does not work! Works great on the iphone if you are using the regular phone though. For skype at my desktop I use the similar boom type plantronics model but because it has a 2.5mm plug I need to use and adapter and when I tried that with 2 different adapters and the earphone sound comes through but the mic does not (tried 2 different adapters!) so you can hear fine but the people on the other end can hear you only through the mic on your phone. In a horribly embarrassing moment I learned that muting the mic did not mean all of my coworkers on the other end of a conference call could not hear me yelling at my dog LOL!Anyway- forsome reason all of 3.5mm headsets that they are still making have the mic on the cord and because I tend to talk while I am doing other things people hear my hair or clothes or whatever brushing up agains the mic so FINALLY found one that had a boom mic AND a 3.5mm jack so I would not need an adapter! Wooohoo! Liberated from my desktop during phone calls finally!Since I used the desktop version of this mic I was already used to the earpiece. I won't lie- it took awhile. It is not uncomfortable in terms of fit (bluetooth one was) but it feels wierd and like it will fall out at any moment. After using it for sometime I have gotten comfortable that it will say in and when I am sitting at my desk I will often find I left it in my ear after ending the call ages ago!Bluetooth can be a great solution but it has its drawbacks (battery, connection quality etc) so I am baffled as to why everyone is leaving the wired ones behind. This is goofy looking for sure but I am not one to walk around the grocery store with this or any other headset on. When I am home or in my car and want to be hands free with a good connection I like a wired solution! If Skype for iphone had worked with bluetooth I would have settled for it since I had already bought it but until it does smartphone users who rely on voip will need this!The annoying thing is that there are lots of headsets out there that say 'works with iphone' and in reality they are 2.5mm plug heasets that come with an adapte. The MX505 also comes in a 2.5mm plug version and inexplicably has the same model number so I had little confidence that I could pick the right listing on amazon and get the right headset from the 3rd party sellers so I bought mine on ebay where the seller confirmed he would send the 3.5mm version so pay attention when you buy!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004F98U8Q" id="B004F98U8Q-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-14:</strong> 'Nuff said.

I found this wired 3.5mm Plantronics MX505 WindSmart Boom Headset and love it. It is very light weight, sits securely on my ear and can be worn for long periods of time. This particular headset secures gently underneath the ear which I really like because over-the-ear headsets make my ears ache. I have unusually small ears so every Bluetooth I've tried won't sit properly and just falls right off. I've had a lot of success with the wired Plantronics headsets in the past and this one is just as good as my previous sets. The sound is crystal clear with no noise or echoing. This set does come with a replacement boom.NOTE: I did buy the 2.5mm to 3.5mm converter when I purchased this headset but found I did not need it as the jack is 3.5mm.

Perhaps these are from an Apple OEM supplier but bypassing the Apple sales channel?  I say this to distinguish this set from another set that I received directly from Hong Kong from another seller (for about a couple bucks) and that looked almost like OEM.  That set, however, had completely unacceptable earphone sound quality - trash bin unacceptable.  The lesson here is to be careful from whom you buy.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GJLUMLQ" id="B00GJLUMLQ-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-06-01:</strong> Me and My Family live on Amazon we always buying gifts and the basic necessities here on Amazon.I am in love with this apple headset, it is quality, fashionable and a basic staple to our society.I recently purchase 20 or so from BAYSHINE TRADING and all of them were fake. However amazon helped me in an A-Z claim as the items were not OEM Original.Overall i am a major fan of this product and bought from here because it is $10 cheaper than amazons.

It was exactly as advertised and still sealed in the Apple plastic wrapping. I decided to go that route because it seemed the reviews of the OEM product was all over the place, some good some bad, leading me to think that the OEM version either had bad quality control, or some of the vendors were not shipping the product as advertised. (I wish more reviewers would actually say which vendor they are getting their product from since I think that makes a big difference) Anyway, the earphone and mic work exactly like the original Apple, since it is. I would have liked to have got a free case, but getting a real Apple vs OEM was worth the sacrifice.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GJLUMLQ" id="B00GJLUMLQ-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-17:</strong> Really love how you can talk on the phone while listening to music and never have to take the earphones out.

I received these (I ordered 2 pairs) within about 3 days of my order which was the first day of the delivery estimate window, didn't have to wait too long at all.Immediately upon receipt I noticed I did not receive the black "heavy duty canvas pouch" - but I didn't want it anyway.As for the earphones themselves...they were "packaged" like an OEM Apple product but once you get your hands on them they don't feel like an OEM Apple product.  The wires are thinner and more flexible and just feel cheaper. The area where the wires come out both sides of the button weren't reinforced like Apple's are. The button was bowed out in the center which makes the button's construction look very cheap and like it wouldn't be long before it falls apart.  The worst problem of all was that neither pair worked properly, at least on iPhone 4S.  They sound and feel normal when you plug them in but once you get on the phone the person on the other end hears only a very loud humming tone and it's too loud to even hear me.  I gave the other pair of earphones to the other person and I had the same problem with those as well. All the reviews on these things were great so maybe it was just the ones from this particular seller that are having issues.In short, all these things are good for is listening to music, but if I just wanted to do that I would have purchased a better set of actual headphones, without worrying about getting a microphone on them.  I'm not comfortable calling these "OEM" as described in the product's TITLE.When confronting the seller with the problem they were very very quick to respond and resolve the issue 100% to my satisfaction. Part of their response was that they "had some issues with one of their suppliers and were working with them to resolve the issue." This raised some flags for me because they made it sounds like these earphones are just cheap imitations like so many others you see on the web, but they are supposed to be OEM products.  So even though my issues are resolved and were resolved quickly, that still doesn't change the fact that they listed these as "OEM" when they probably were not...so I have to warn future buyers.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GJLUMLQ" id="B00GJLUMLQ-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-05:</strong> for the price i jumped up and down with a feelilng of accomplishment,,, i truly saved a buck... good product good price.. i am very happy</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GJLUMLQ" id="B00GJLUMLQ-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-08:</strong> OKAY SO FIRST OF ALL  THE MICROPHONE DONT WORK 2ND THE VOLUME THING DOSE NOT WORK ONE OF THE EARPHONES DOSE NOT WORK DONT BUT THIS CRAP SAVE UR 7 DLLS ITS NOT OEM SO SO MAD &#62;:(</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GJLUMLQ" id="B00GJLUMLQ-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-06:</strong> They are all a piece of junk.

Despite this they do the job and no one would know the difference. The only thing I will say is that the microphone doesn't work.

After receiving mine, I inspected them closely and tried them out. Everything seems to indicate that these are OEM. About the only difference I saw was in the packaging and also the color or the in-line remote. These came in a plastic bag with a sticker on it. Of course the OEM Apple product came inside the box with a simple clear plastic wrap around it. The second difference was the color of the inside part of the remote. These were just white whereas the OEM ones I had were a light grey. I've uploaded a picture so people can compare. With regards to the function and the look  and feel, they are exactly like the OEM units. So perhaps these are not from Apple, but they appear to be made by the same folks who are making them for Apple, which seems close enough. Bottom line is that for the price, it's a great deal.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GJLUMLQ" id="B00GJLUMLQ-review45" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-27:</strong> I ordered these headphones after mine were lost/stolen. i received them in three business days, which is good. i have had them for two days now. the packaging was cheap though, but i cant complain because shipping was free. no boxes were included in my package, the headphones, and case were just in a plastic package, but nothing seems to be damaged, headphones sound GREAT! but the case is another story. it is not the case shown in the description, its kinda ghetto, but its still of good quality.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GJLUMLQ" id="B00GJLUMLQ-review46" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-28:</strong> Once again--great product for price.

It does double the tablet's thickness (maybe 2.5x times the thickness), but it's ok since holding a bare tablet can cramp up your hands, so having a thicker tablet to hold on to will relieve some of the stress.  The texture is great, only if it's remains clean and free from dust, clean it often so that the exterior doesnt become too slick.  A wet sponge (you can take off the cover from the tablet of course) will keep the surface from collecting too much dust and particles.  I treat it like a table tennis rubber paddle (see care for ping pong paddles) to make it last and feel tacky for years of non-slip use.  All the cut-outs line up and I would recommend this to anyone that uses their tablet a lot.  I would also mention that this tablet is too thick to be placed into a docking station.  So be mindful of that.  I'm not a guy that love accessories, but this one is a must-have.  The thickness is good enough that you can put this face-down on a table and it will keep the screen from being scratched up, so you dont need a screen protector shield (I'm not a fan of them).  If anything, I'm a purist when it comes to keeping the tablet as raw as possible, so if I need to sell it, it will feel as if it came out of the box unused.  This is one of the best cases to use.  Easy to clean (since you can just take it off and just hand-wash in the sink and let it air-dry).  The black doesnt stay black if you carry it around and you have a dusty environment it's a magnet for dust, I would get a different color.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008ZYL4J4" id="B008ZYL4J4-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-01:</strong> I was sent a Galaxy tab case instead of the one i ordered for my galaxy Note 10.1.

There are just so many good things about this phone and the Windows Phone 8 OS that it is tough to know where to start. I suppose I should start out by stating that I am somewhat of a Windows "fanboy" for lack of a better word. I am all in when it comes to Microsoft products owning the Xbox 360, Surface RT tablet, Windows 8 Pro laptop and of course Windows Phone. That being said I do try to rate products fairly but I wanted you the reader to know that there may be some bias in my review.I have owned several Windows Phones over the past few years. The Samsung Focus, Focus 2, HTC Titan, Lumia 900 and now the Lumia 920. I have thoroughly enjoyed each of the phones but the 920 certainly stands out as to what I feel is finally a true competitor to the Iphones and Samsungs of the world.This phone has some serious specs and can hold its own against its rivals when it comes to pure processing power. Everything is super smooth on this phone. Apps launch quickly, the internet is super speedy thanks to the LTE and the camera snaps pic after pic without a stutter. I finally feel that my phone isn't preventing me from doing anything that I want to do with it. I am very impressed with the power and speed of the 920.SCREEN: The screen is just gorgeous. It has a super high resolution which makes everything look soooo good. Text is easy to read and pictures just come to life (corny but true!) The screen also has a super sensitive mode where you can actually wear winter gloves and still control the phone as normal. It is pretty amazing the first time I tried this. You can also shut this off so you have complete control as to whether to use it or not.CAMERA: If you like to take pictures with your phone then this really is the phone for you. Nokia has done some amazing things with their camera technology here. The image stabilization for photos and videos is second to none. I have pretty shaky hands but all my pics and vids come out super smooth with this phone. The night time is where the camera tech really shines. Whether you are indoors or outdoors with poor to almost no light this camera still takes really bright and clear pics! It really is a must have feature if you like to take pics. The camera on this phone has replaced my need for a separate point and shoot camera. No joke. It is that good. If I were to critique the camera in any way it would be to say that the pics sometimes come out a little "soft" when taking pics during the day. Nokia has already stated that they plan a soon to be released update that allows for sharper pics so that negative could very well vanish in the near future.SOUND: I have never really been impressed with the sound quality of any phone I have ever had as far as playing music through the speakers without headphones. It is no different for me with the 920. The stereo speakers are ok but I wouldn't recommend listening to music without headphones. Once you do hook up your favorite pair of headphones the sound is much improved. Nokia uses Dolby Headphone technology and the sound the phone produces while using earbuds is impressive. The volume isn't the loudest but definitely loud enough to easily block out any outside noises. Also, no earbuds come with the phone.CALL QUALITY: So far I have no complaints with the call quality. When I ask people how I sound they say everything sounds good. I can also hear them easily and clearly through the earpiece. I am not a huge phone user on my phone (doh!) but so far I have had a very pleasant experience on calls.BATTERY LIFE: So far I am getting better than expected battery life. I thought with LTE I would be burning through a charge in 4 or 5 hours but so far I am easily making it through an entire work day with moderate use. I can take the phone off the charger at 5:30 AM and when I go to bed at around 10 or 11 at night I still have about 15-25 percent left. To me that is more than adequate. The battery does seem to get a bit warm when playing games or really pushing the LTE but I think that is pretty normal for these powerful phones.WIRELESS CHARGING: I purchased my 920 through an ATT store which was running a promotion for a free wireless charger. The 920 has that ability built right into the phone! It is pretty darn useful too. I keep the charging plate right on my nightstand and when I am done reading in bed I just place it on the pad and it starts to charge. No need to fumble with cords.BUILD QUALITY: This is one SOLID phone. I don't plan on dropping it but I would have to say that I would worry more about what I drop this on then the phone itself. This actually leads to what may be a downside for some people. The phone, compared to other phones, is a little heavier. I don't find it to be an issue and in fact like the strong feel of the phone but go to the store and check it out because some have noted that it bothered them.APPS: The Lumia 920 comes with Nokia Drive which is a really nice navigation app that easily compares to the paid version out there. I have used it a bunch of times and it has worked flawlessly every time. You also get a Microsoft Office suite which includes PowerPoint, Word, Excel and One Note. While I don't see myself creating complex spreadsheets on a phone it certainly is nice to be able to open and edit if I need to.OK, it looks like I rambled on way too long. I hope you found some useful info in my review. If you have any specific questions you want answers to just leave a comment and I will try to answer them all.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A2V7BA4" id="B00A2V7BA4-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-14:</strong> _________________________________________A not-so-serious review first:Lumia 920 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> iPHone 532GB ---------------------------------------------32GB$99------------------------------------------------$299Master Maps-------------------------------------Mess-up MapsOffline GPS---------------------------------------iLostPublic transit guide for global traveler ------iLonely and secretly flirt with SiriPureView Camera-------------------------------PurpleView CameraClear lowlight photos---------------------------My party photos are drunker(fuzzier) than yoursAnti-scratch--------------------------------------Full-ScratchSurvives a fall-----------------------------------The poor pretty thing!Gets the job done-------------------------------What job?Good for normal people-----------------------Good for Apple worshipersNokia: "Sorry, we will update"-----------------Apple: "You're holding it wrong!"Clear view under direct sunlight--------------Is my phone on?4.5" viewing asset-------------------------------Squint retinallyWireless charger--------------------------------Where is my this-year's-special cable?Touchscreen wearing gloves-----------------Cut a hole on gloveA more serious review follows:Having used the phone for a while now, I'd like to provide a more objective assessment. I give ratings below first, followed by detailed explanations.  The rating numbers are on a scale of 10.  A score of "10" means it is not only the best but also has no apparent need to improve, and a score less than "10" just means there is room to improve but does not necessarily mean another product is better. The numbers in the parentheses are for iPhone 5 as a reference.RATINGS-------------  Lumia 920 (vs. iPhone 5)Call Quality --------------------10 (8)  Uncompromising call quality from Nokia, a true phone companyInstant Messaging------------10 (10)  Big improvement over WP7; group messaging and MMSE-Mail-----------------------------9 (7) WP8 has the best enterprise-ready e-mail clientSkype and VoIP calls----------9 (7)  International VoIP calls a reality with on WP8Contact Management---------9 (6)  WP8's multi-contact aggregator and integrator the bestEntertainment-----------------10 (10)  Too much already, what more could you wantSocial Networking--------------9 (8)  Facebook integration is an edgeWeb browsing------------------9 (8)  IE10 is outstandingShopping------------------------7 (9)  Comes from Apple's apps edgeNavigation-----------------------8 (5)  Apple's first Maps is actually impressive, but see discussionsProductivity---------------------6 (3)  Not there yet, but at least WP8 can do some workScreen--------------------------10 (8) Lumia 920 has the best looking screen consumers have ever seenCamera--------------------------9 (7)  In its own leagueBuild quality-------------------10 (8) You might have trouble to say goodbye to Lumia 920 two years laterThermal performance---------8 (8)  CompetitiveBattery life----------------------5 (5)  All need improvement badly in this areaOS reliability--------------------9.9 (9.5)  WP8 never even freezes, much less crashesOS fluency----------------------9.5 (9)  Ice-skating with WP8, and floor dancing with iOS, I much prefer the formerOS flexibility/customization---8 (8)  Android is the kingOS refinement------------------7.5 (9.5)  Microsoft is still no Apple on refined detailsOS apps ecosystem-----------6 (9.5)  iOS rules for nowCurrent Fashion Index--------0 (11)To ease your reading, I'll put the conclusion first before the detailed sections.CONCLUSION:  Laying aside the nitpicking, I am in love with my Lumia. There are so many great phones today that it has become a problem to choose one. But the top WP8 phone is the choice by both my brain and my heart. If I were a bit geekier, I might have gone with Android; and if I didn't have to work I might have gone with iPhone. But this is my phone. It's for a practical man with a taste.  I hesitated when Lumia 800 came out, knowing that it would be incompatible with WP8. Now Lumia 920 is such an attractive package. I don't think I'll change my phone anytime soon, although I do hope that there would be some nice updates from both Microsoft and Nokia to make this phone even better.1. CALL QUALITYIt is a phone after all. The call quality of Lumia 920 is absolutely top-notch. The voice is so clear it puts my landline cordless phone to shame. Nokia knows how to make phones. They are the true phone company. The HAAC microphones (Rich Recording Mic) are not your ordinary microphones on cell phones. A different league. The speakerphone is pretty good too, quite loud and clear. In fact I once had a conference call using the speakerphone with several people on my side, and it worked out fine.2. E-MAILOverall, WP8 has the best mobile e-mail. Windows Phone has an inherent advantage in e-mail, especially work e-mails. Apple does not own a popular e-mail service, and can only support third-party e-mails. Android enjoys the excellent Gmail, but Gmail does not have a strong foothold in the workplace.WP8 has deep integration of Exchange, Office 365's Outlook e-mail, Hotmail and Live Mail on Windows Phone.  WP8 further has excellent integration with the popular Gmail and Yahoo Mail.  All this results in an e-mail client that is more capable and efficient than other platforms. To name a few, contact management, contact synchronization, message management, message synchronization, file management, attachment management, folder management, conversation thread management, and e-mail search, are significantly better on Windows Phone e-mail. The difference is far deeper than appearance.  If you handle e-mails with some degree of sophistication, you will appreciate the difference.I travel with both my iPad and Windows Phone. Unless I am using my computer, I usually reach out for the Windows Phone for e-mails instead of the iPad, despite the fact that the e-mails on iPad have so much better readability. This wasn't the case before when I used an iPhone. To just read a recent e-mail, the iPad is an obvious choice. But you don't just read a recent e-mail. Work e-mails have history and threads, and they need to be searchable, and fully synchronized with your computer, and that's where the Windows Phone shines.For example, if you just read or deleted an e-mail on you phone, you want the status to synchronize with the server and other devices, otherwise you end up paying attention to the same e-mail too many times or having to delete the same e-mail multiple times. For another example, if you need to search to find an older e-mail which is not stored on your phone (due to memory conservation, mobile devices do not download and keep a copy of every e-mail in the past), you want your mobile e-mail to give you an opportunity to search e-mails on the server. WP8 does these perfectly.I also like the fact that Windows Phone has a separate live tile with a customized icon for each e-mail account. I don't like the idea of mixing my work e-mail and personal e-mail in the same box, or even under the same icon. I need a clean definition of territories. Of course, if you intend to combine e-mails, you can do that as well on WP8. Flexibility.3. SKYPE AND NON-CELLULAR SERVICE DEPENDENT PHONE CALLSSkype, owned by Microsoft now, is an important function on WP. Microsoft also makes a Skype app for iOS, but the app is still not nearly as good as the integrated Skype on the Windows Phone.If you use Skype Pro and/or Skype Out, you can actually make phone calls anywhere in the world as long as you have Wi-Fi or cellular data connection. I'm not talking about Skype-to-Skype calls. I'm talking about calling real phone numbers. (This works only with Skype Pro; the free Skype account can only make online Skype calls). No cellular phone connection is required with Skype Pro on Windows Phone.Take an international trip you will understand what I'm saying. Being able to call home and work at international airports *without* a SIM card for the local service is a major convenience. Even if you already have got a local SIM card, using Skype Pro on Windows Phone to make calls on the 3G/4G data service is still a great convenience because it costs only two cents a minute, less than 1/20 of the cost for international calls made on a regular cell phone.  It also works other way around. You can make international calls from the US using Skype Pro on your Windows Phone for two cents a minute.Cheap international calls anywhere on your cell phone (and enjoying the integrated phone contacts) - I hope this concept registers with you.4. CONTACT MANAGEMENTThe People Hub on the Windows Phone deserves a separate mentioning. This is by and large the best contact management on a cell phone (WebOS users might have an issue with the statement). It automatically integrates all the contacts from different sources (e-mails, Skype and Facebook) and provides the best accessibility and connectivity on a mobile device.This significantly betters iOS, which has a pretty address book and good editing capabilities, but very little beyond that. When it comes to multi-source contacts integration, accessibility and connectivity, the People Hub on WP is much superior to iOS's contact management.For example, iOS address book has links to internal phone numbers and e-mail addresses, but basically that's it. It does not have active links to external phone numbers (e.g.,contacts pulled from e-mail accounts), Skype contacts, and Facebook friends, etc.. In the People Hub, all these have active links, meaning that they provide a single click connection.In addition, People Hub pulls contacts from Skype, which iOS does not do at all.  If you use Skype, especially Skype Pro, you'd suffer a disconnection on iOS.Both address books link contact addresses to maps, but the Apple maps is essentially dysfunctional in this respect. Apple hasn't really spent time to make sure this function actually works (they have been focused on making the thing look pretty). It doesn't work most of the time.  Unless you have entered the contact address in a particular manner, clicking the address will result in a "not found" on the maps. The People Hub works perfectly with maps.Under the hood,  this is actually a search algorithm issue, not a user interface issue. Like Google,  Microsoft knows search. It shows.5. PRODUCTIVITYWindows Phone 8 wins this important area hands down, not because it is so good, but because others are so bad. The major thing is the Office App and OneNote App, and their integration with the excellent and generous (but underrated) SkyDrive. This allows Windows Phone to do the most essential things for productivity. WP8 further integrates Office 365 and SkyDrive perfectly. If you or your company subscribe to Office 365 and use the cloud versions of the OneNote, Office, Outlook, TeamSite and SharePoint, the productivity is boosted to a whole new level. The iPhone and Android simply cannot provide that kind of productivity. Even if you don't use Office 365, getting the Windows Live and Skydrive would already be the best productive user experience because of the integration with the Web version of Office.I hear people say that they can use an Office-emulating app to do some work on the iPhone (or Android). But no. For serious work, it simply doesn't work. You open a document (Word or PowerPoint, for example), do a slight editing, thinking that you have saved a bit time working on your smart phone, but only to later discover (or be told by an upset colleague) that you changed the subtle aspects of the formatting and styling of the document. That doesn't work for me, nor for anyone I work with. Work environment cannot allow this. The fundamental difference is that the Office App on WP8 and Office Web version have complete compatibility with the traditional Office, while other apps don't. They are built on different foundations. Microsoft's mobile renditions of Office may lack many features of the full Office, but they are completely compatible with it, and that's extremely important. When it comes to work documents, compatibility is more important than feature set.Overall, if documents and e-mails are just different ways of casual "instant messaging" to you, the iPhone is fine. But if documents and e-mails are a work tool to you, Windows Phone is the way to go.6. NAVIGATIONFirst of all, for those who miss Bing Maps, your Windows Phone still has it. It's only two taps away: tap the Bing search button (hardware button on the right side at the bottom), and then tap the "Local Scout" button (on the left side of the three on the search page).In addition to Bing Maps, Nokia offers a set of navigation apps including Nokia Maps, Nokia Drive, Transit, and City Lens. They together offer excellent navigation, better than Bing Maps alone, and also better than what iOS has to offer.Apple's first map is actually impressive with good features and of course great looks. But as Google has said, doing maps is hard. It's years of exercise versus a morning makeup. Currently, Apple Maps does have a problem. The reports of Apple's terrible map performance are related to map data inaccuracy and map search algorithms. Those Apple fans who refute such reports by claiming that they haven't experienced any problems are missing the point. Unlike other software in which a test is usually universal, your map test results only have to do with the location you tried, and only proves that the map is OK in that one location. When there is a problem at another location, there is a problem. And Apple has a lot of such problems reported. The company acknowledges it. They're not fools.  I don't know how fast Apple can improve on that. Data and fundamental algorithms are far more than just doing some programming to add skins. They might need to shell out a billion dollars to buy up.Compared to the excellent Google Maps, Nokia's navigation solution is mixed. It's worse in some ways, but better in other ways. Google shines on map data, especially in the North America segment, no question about it. Google's superiority in search is also reflected in its maps. The app overall feels more mature and advanced, further boosted by is far greater user base (which they earned).But Nokia has several important things on its side. The segmented downloadable maps for off-line GPS is a unique and significant advantage for Nokia. The reliable integration with contact addresses (People Hub) is another. The multi-angle approach of Nokia's navigation app set suits user's particular need better. Nokia also has comparable map data (although arguably slightly inferior North America segment) and mature map algorithms.Nokia's navigation solution comes with several separate apps. In comparison, Google puts everything under Google Maps. I like Nokia's way of tasking.  The Nokia apps are meant to be connected (they need to work more on that). You start with one app, but may transit to another when you need it. If done right, Nokia's approach could directly put the user at the best leveraging angle depending on the actual situation, using a specific app with the most suited user interface to maximize the user experience. Some people complain about it either because of their unfamiliarity with this design or their dissatisfaction with the current execution. I hope Nokia doesn't change this good concept, but just keeps on perfecting the apps and improving the integration under this framework.An often overlooked but significant feature Nokia offers is downloadable maps segmented according to regions. Once downloaded to your phone's local storage, the maps are fully functional off-line even when you don't have any cellular network or WiFi access. That could be a matter of getting or not getting to the destination. If you don't think this is important, I don't know what is. Even when cellular network is present, the off-line GPS map means big savings on your data usage.With the downloaded maps, the navigation on Lumia 920 may replace standalone GPS units. It has vastly better user interface to start with.  Address search, which is probably the most frustrating thing on standalone GPS units, is far better on Nokia Drive. The overall user experience is superior despite its lack of a few features. But if you need a dedicated GPS unit constantly mounted in the car, that's a different story.If you happen to be at a place without a car (Americans, have you traveled to other places in the world? People don't always drive), try Nokia Transit, which provides detailed guide for public transportation of cities around the world.Nokia takes navigation seriously. They have had an excellent maps tradition and accumulated expertise with Symbian-based cell phones. Considering that they jumped on the WP ship only recently, I'm confident that they will make this whole thing even better in a quite fast pace.7. THE SCREENBoth Lumia 920 and iPhone 5 have gorgeous screens, but the Lumia is still better. The viewability under direct sunlight is noticeably better on Lumia 920. Both are extremely clear for text and webpage rendering, but Lumia 920 works much better in the portrait mode because of its greater viewing dimension.And Lumia 920 has touchscreen capability when you wear gloves. This may come handy in very cold winter outdoors. But for me, the usefulness is more than during the winter. To protect my hands from suffering  painful skin and split fingernails, I often need to wear a glove on my right hand while I'm doing air traveling. Lumia 920 is the only phone that I can use wearing a glove. It is not a gimmick at all.8. THE CAMERALumia 920 has the best cell phone camera on the market, leading by a significant margin, except for Nokia's own PureView 808 which is a different type of device.  I say this very objectively. Those who don't see the difference either didn't test it under right conditions, or simply can't tell the differences in photo quality. Lumia 920 is the only smartphone camera that can take decent concert (or party) photos and videos. Its lowlight performance is at least two ISO stops (that's 4 times) better than the iPhone 5.  This is primarily due to Nokia's unique pixel binning technology further combined with image stabilization. Neither Nokia nor Apple makes the camera sensors (Sony does), but the photo quality is not only about the sensor itself. Nokia has a tremendous technological and patent advantage in this area.By the way, stop comparing which camera has more megapixels. High MP is a trick used by camera makers to tax on consumer ignorance, and in most cases has very little correlation to picture quality. On cell phones in particular, there are several reasons why it's meaningless to pursue higher MP count. First, no tiny lens on a cell phone is capable of optically resolving pixel numbers beyond 5MP. I challenge you to find a scientific test to prove otherwise. Second, because of the very small sensor sizes, low light performance is a far bigger problem than the number of pixels. Third, you don't need more than 2MP on a cell phone. Generally, photos taken by smart phones are only used for screen viewing instead of making large prints. Even 2MP would be plenty. For web posting, a high-quality 1MP photo would look far better than a lousy 10MP photo.I'm not saying that a smaller pixel number is a good thing in itself. On the contrary, I'm just saying that for a given sensor technology, pixel density is the best sacrifice to make if the goal is to take better pictures with a cell phone camera sensor.  Most consumers don't realize that for any given sensor technology, an increase of pixel density comes at the expense of lowlight performance and dynamic range. (Many people intuitively reject this notion, reasoning that it does not make sense that lowlight performance and dynamic range would be affected by pixel density as you can always downsample. But to understand this, you must stop treating pixels as abstract geometrical concepts but actual engineered photosites with optically dead physical boundaries. That is a different topic though.)Every time when the sensor chip technology is improved, they usually have two options: (1) increase the lowlight performance and dynamic range by keeping the same pixel density, or (2) increase the pixel density (to get a greater MP count for a given sensor size) by holding back the real performance. Unfortunately they usually choose the latter because the MP count is a much more marketable gimmick.So instead of honest value, we now have the madness of smartphones reaching and going beyond 10MP with little meaningful result but unnecessarily bad lowlight performance, poor dynamic range, and a big waste of storage, data usage and processing time. Had they focused on real performances on 2-4MP sensors with a generous sensor size permissible on smartphones, we would have now had much more useful cameras on these gadgets.In this regard, Nokia is doing great in spite of (not because of) joining the megapixel race, again thanks to its pixel binning technology and image stabilization.9. BUILD QUALITYNokia 920 is a marvelous piece of engineering and manufacturing. Both Nokia 920 and iPhone 5 have a premium appearance, only very different flavors. But the Nokia is without question tougher. I say this not because Nokia is heavier. They use different materials. In choosing materials, these two companies have very different philosophies. Apple always goes after materials that enable extremely slim and light products, while Nokia has always been concerned of durability.If you are already conditioned to update your phone every year, you are an ideal Apple-kind person already. But still, hold your iPhone dearly and don't drop it. I have an iPad 3 that was accidentally dropped from a sofa sidetable to a hard floor head-down. I was completely shocked by the amount of damage it caused. I was expecting a dent on the edge or at worst a crack on the screen, but the whole thing was smashed like glass. That's when I discovered that the iPod 3 uses a glasslike material even for the frame, which looks great, but, just don't drop it.So you might actually need a case for your iPhone.  Lumia 920 does not need one. In fact, I can't imagine a case for Lumia 920 without ruining its gorgeous appearance.10. THE DESIGNThis is completely subjective. But I personally feel iPhone 5 is too youthful and delicate, and better in a hand of a teenager, while the Samsung Galaxy S3 too rounded and has no character. I love the overall masculine (but gentle and absolutely not rough) and squarely straight style of Lumia 920.  Go to YouTube to hear Marko Ahtisaari of Nokia articulating the design philosophy.11. THERMAL BEHAVIOR AND BATTERY LIFEThe Nokia 920 does not run hot, thankfully. This is one thing I was particularly worried after the bad experience with the Dell Venue Pro which had disgusting thermal performance and power management.Battery life is good, although not excellent, comparable to other top performers such as iPhone 5.  If there would be an improvement that could persuade me to change my phone again, it would be a new phone that could last at least a couple of busy days without recharging. I am not a heavy mobile user, but I'm out on a trip quite often.  The battery life of my cell phone is among the biggest mental burdens while traveling. Unfortunately, it looks like battery life is not what these companies are focusing on at this time.12. APPSiPhone wins by a large margin in terms of app number. Although a vast majority of apps are junk on both systems, there are some great apps on both; iOS just has more due to its sheer larger base. So it seems that most people will need to sacrifice a few apps by choosing Windows Phone platform for now. I'm missing quite a few useful apps on the Windows Phone, and make up the deficiency by using the iPad. Windows Phone also has some very good apps that are missing on iOS (in addition to Nokia apps and Microsoft apps), although not as critical.The most important app I miss on the Windows Phone is a decent PDF reader. Microsoft rushed out its own PDF reader, which works for basic reading but has some serious limitations. I hope Adobe or a third-party releases a better PDF reader on WP8 soon. This is a big pain point.However, none of these missing apps has the kind of importance comparable to that of navigation and productivity. To me, the choice is clear. I think it's misleading to do "bean counting" the small things of each system. You've got to have priority. If you need one function that has a dominating priority, then one million less useful "apps" would no longer matter.Despite the relative minor changes in appearance from WP7 to WP8, Windows Phone 8 has got a much better foundation in the program architecture than WP7.  With the Windows NT kernel and 90% source code compatibility with Windows RT, the app future looks good.13. FLUENCY AND EFFICIENCY OF THE OPERATING SYSTEMWindows Phone 8 on Lumia 920 beats iOS on iPhone 5 in terms of fluency and efficiency. WP has a hardware "Back" button in addition to the Home button, while iPhone has just a Home button. This has a significant impact on the flow of operation.  I know this is rather subjective, but one thing that particularly bothers me on the iOS is that it requires you to always go back to the home button. You can't directly go back to another place you have just visited. You always have to go back home and start from there again. I remember Steve Jobs proudly making a big point out of it. Theoretically, going back home and then to the last app takes only two steps, but problem is that when you have multiple pages of apps, it causes a bit of hesitation to locate an app.Both iOS's "double-clicking Home" and WP's "long-pressing back button" give you a nice quick list of the opened apps to simplify the selection of apps, but still the additional "Back" button functionality WP is very much appreciated.Another thing that impacts the efficiency is the management of installed apps. The iOS manages installed apps in a simplistic way with much emphasis on the appearance not the functionality. Windows Phone has a much more sophisticated way. The installed apps are directly and separately searchable, and are also automatically organized under alphabetical categories that can be quickly accessed through a single page grid (which itself is accessible by a single swipe). If you have less than 20 installed apps, you will see no difference. If you have about 20-50, the difference would start to show. With 50-100, it becomes apparent, and beyond 100, the difference would be huge. The more apps you install, the greater the difference would be. So power users will find this an advantage on Windows Phone.When you come to think of it, the above may be the reasons why the iOS is so intuitive for beginners, but less efficient for more experienced users. On user interfaces, these two things often conflict. I can see why many like the flow design of iOS, but I prefer WP8's flow much better.14.  CUSTOMIZATIONIt almost sounds silly that one of the biggest improvements WP8 has over WP7 is adding some smaller sized tiles. Hardly innovative, but it makes a big difference, largely speaking against the old design. I don't like those big tiles. I simply don't think any app deserves that much attention, especially in such a uniquely precious small room. I customized my start page to have all tiles in quarter size except for the phone button. Thank you, Microsoft, for allowing such basic freedom. My start space is now much more efficiently used and no longer a victim of the almost tyrant "less is more" so-called clean design philosophy.The level of customization further down is mostly on par with the iOS.  Android would still have an edge over both, but I think this is got to a very reasonable level already.But I do have one big complaint against Windows Phone:  With WP8, you still can't turn off that stupid screen auto-rotation. You simply can't so far. No user settings has that. No app that does that. Even unlocked phone can't do that. Forgive me to call auto-rotation feature stupid. But it is one of those tech-things that make no sense on a mobile phone, precisely because a mobile phone is just so, mobile. The problem is that these device designers fail to understand that the proper (or desired) orientation of the screen simply cannot be determined by an orientation sensor. The sensor determines the orientation using gravity and the earth as the reference, not your body. As a result, the sensor can only detect the phone's orientation itself, not its relative orientation to the user's body posture, which is what actually matters.  So it works properly only when you are standing straight, not when you are inclined or lie down. In fact, it always turns to the wrong orientation when you are inclined or lie down, so you have to fight it.In practice, the non-switchable autorotation causes much more annoyance than any utility. It is OK if they just use it as a gimmick to attract feature counters, but it is not OK to have it permanently implemented and cannot be turned off. It's simply stupid.I think the best solution is iPad 3's combination of autorotation plus a hardware-based button for a mechanical lock. It combines the best of both worlds. The iPhone has autorotation plus user manual options in the settings and apps, which is not as good as the iPad, but still much better than Windows Phone's autorotation only, whenever and wherever.The reason why I make this auto-rotation issue such a big deal is just to make a point, not because the thing itself is so life-threatening. I can live with the annoyance. But the failure or overlook of such issues after all these years is very telling of Microsoft.15.  REFINEMENT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEMWhen it comes to very fine details, Apple wins. WP8 has improved over WP7, but still no match to the iOS in its refinement of details. Company wise, and culture wise, Microsoft has not fully learned this art yet. Let me name a few:(1) The input mode is still a mess despite an excellent keyboard. Although typing new text is easy, accurately placing the cursor to edit text is virtually impossible. Also, you can't quickly do a "select all" to copy and paste a text.  It requires a painful maneuver to do so, many times more difficult than doing the same on iOS which gives you a selection in an automatically pop-up menu. Oh please, they struggled with this copy and paste thing from the very beginning and received a disproportionately great amount of criticisms, so you would think that they would have jumped all over it to not only improve it, but in fact over-improve it. Not at all. It's still a half cooked solution.(2) The network status indicators on the top of the screen don't stay. They disappear transiently. You have to touch the screen in a particular manner to bring them back. You can't change that in the settings. This is useless frivolous design. The indicators don't occupy extra space at all when they are displayed, and their disappearance does not result in any benefit. It just makes the system fussy and less certain. My basic assertion is that cell phone's network status is a constant user concern, and being able to glance at these essential indicators any time gives you peace of mind, and is a good part of the harmonious "handset environment". Having to always struggle for such a simple thing is nonsense especially when the sacrifice is made for no purpose.I think what happened at Microsoft was like this: One day, someone from Microsoft management shouted in a meeting: "Less is more! Less is more! Look at Apple, we need to learn from them!" And shortly after that, a Microsoft engineer came up with this idea of hiding the network status indicators...Microsoft has done the hard part of building a very promising mobile OS, it shouldn't be so difficult for them to do these very basic and simple things right. It is obviously not an engineering issue. It is a product management issue.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A2V7BA4" id="B00A2V7BA4-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-31:</strong> I love everything about this phone. It's amazing. Most of all: IT'S STABLE!I switched from Android after having 3 Android phones (DroidX, DroidX2 and Samsung Galaxy Nexus) and I couldn't be happier. Windows Phone is faster, has higher quality apps, and is far, far, far more stable and easy to use than any Android phone.There are some apps missing from the Store that I used on Android, but most already have 3rd party replacements or are scheduled to be released in 2012 (Like Spotify, Instagram, and Pandora for example). Instead, I have apps like Xbox Music, which I've found to be a fantastic replacement for Spotify. The app is cleaner, has a huge music library, and syncs instantly with my Windows 8 PC.I've found that Nokia Maps is REALLY great now that the Nokia Lumia 920 has received an update since it's release. Having free GPS on my phone was a requirement to switch and Nokia nailed it. I don't even miss Google Maps anymore.I still have common apps like Evernote, Glympse, Skype, and of course Angry Birds. I even have a third party Google Mapps app to find my Android friends on Latitude. So even popular Google services are available in some fashion. But between the apps and the Xbox games, the AWESOME battery life with LTE (I NEVER had that on Android!!!), Wireless Charging, and incredible camera: There is nothing about this phone not to enjoy.I can only point out that it's heavier than other smartphones as a negative. But when you're talking weight in Grams, "heavy" is negligible.Nokia adds incredible value to the Windows Phone platform and is surely the #1 choice for Windows Phone 8.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A2V7BA4" id="B00A2V7BA4-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-03:</strong> Windows 8 is really slick.  I know many people hate it, and I was one who delayed converting because of the reviews and bad experiences I read about.  I finally built a PC and bought a touchscreen for it, so I installed win8...and we love it.  I even upgraded two more PCs and use touchpads and regular mice with those, and it's amazing.  If you're scared off by the reviews, give it a try and some time to get acclimated...you won't regret it.I mention that because once you familiarize yourself with Win8, a Windows phone is a no-brainer.  I've used iOS and Android...of those two, I prefer Android.  But Windows8 is now my favorite.  The live tiles are cool, being able to customize your home screen, re-size tiles...all very slick.The camera on this phone is great.  Low-light pictures are really good.  No comparison to other smartphones.  In regular lighting, I think it's comparable to others, but not outstanding.  Haven't shot video yet, but I understand that is another area it can excel in.The size and weight were a big concern BEFORE I got the phone.  I had read the reviews and people, even those who liked the phone said the heft was a significant drawback.  I had used a GS3 previously, so I was concerned that I was going to a phone with a smaller screen but significantly more "weight".  I can tell you now that it's way overblown.  The size and weight are not significant at all.  It's definitely heavier but it doesn't feel disproportionately so.  It has a really good feel in your hand and the weight seems to contribute (positively) to that.It's very intuitive to operate and since it's Windows-based, you just plug it in to your PC and it opens like any other drive or device in explorer.  Drag and drop files between folders...very simple.The wireless charging is probably the coolest part of this phone.  You just set it on the plate and it charges.  I got a free wireless charger with the phone, so it's not even any extra cost right now.  Now that I've had this, I wonder why every phone doesn't make this standard!  So easy and cool.  I bought an extra charger to take to work!The one negative you may find, especially if you are a big app user, is that there is not the volume of apps available yet for windows.  I don't use a ton of them, and I was able to find either the same app or a comparable/better alternative for everything except for one.  I'm not typical, probably, so consider that before you jump in.  However, things like the Nokia Music app are free and you can download music for free to play on the device...you can set up your own mix or go with theirs, and then download to listen offline.  Update the list occasionally and you'll get a new mix.  And it's all free.All in all, I thought the GS3 was the best phone I had used when I got it last year.  It's still a great phone, but now having used the Windows based phone, I think Microsoft finally got this right.  The seamless integration between phone and PC is finally evident and I can't believe it was MSFT that did it...I am really impressed with this phone.UPDATE: Battery life is excellent (for a smartphone).  I can get through a day at work, with normal usage (mostly texting, checking email,listening to music on the commute) using only half the battery.  It seems like it really conserves battery when the screen is inactive during the night.  Much better than my Samsung android phones.  I used less than 5% of the battery overnight on the Lumia vs. 17%-20% minimum on the GS3 and Note.  Another thing that is nice is that on my GS3 I ran Avast mobile security but on the Win8 platform programs are all sandboxed so processes can't' hijack and run when another process is running, thus better security and no need to run additional software on the phone for security.  That's very nice to know as well, especially given the popularity of MSFT hacks and attacks.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A2V7BA4" id="B00A2V7BA4-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-11:</strong> The 920 is the pinacle of smartphones today. Speed, elegance, great design and awesome OS, all for a good price. I never really considered a Windows phone, but know I wanted to get away from my iPhone. I also wanted to get away from AT&T;, but unfortunately, they are the only carrier for this phone. After many calls, a store visit and failed attempts on the website, I finally got my order in and received my phones the next day.It seemed like every professional review of this phone commented on it's size and weight being to much. I think it's just fine and feels very solid in your hand. Microsoft has really produced a great experience with their OS. It's easy, intuitive and has features no other OS has. I particularly like the integration of my work email and Outlook.

Live Tile remains one of the best interface innovation on any platform, the addition of a smaller size of tile makes thing only better. Ability to change tile size of any app depending on user's priority is simply brilliant. Nokia Windows Phones come with access to Nokia's full suite of mapping apps, although they are now available to others also, Nokia stays on top of the game by providing other exclusive apps like Nokia Music, Cinematograph, Storage Manager etc. Offline mapping data is a godsend. Added capability of apps' to integrate to lock screen to quickly provide you with info you care about the most is also awesome. The added accessibility tools like changeable font size, UI zoom, high contrast mode(looks freaking gorgeous) makes the OS the best choice for people who needs any of them. The usual goodies are of course still there.Onto the device itself. The screen size is 4.5", which in my opinion is the perfect size, not too small, not too big. The high PPI screen is a joy to use. It retains 900's slightly squarer 15:9 aspect ratio, and the increased PPI makes it one of the best display in the market. The curved display's edge meets the rest of the body flawlessly, making the phone a joy to hold. The poly-carbonate's texture is simply luxurious. The material also means that color won't come off even if scratched. Nokia has used a new kind of coating on the logo, and the three capacitive keys that makes it really easy to see them even when the back-light is off. Slightly raised position of the keys is also a very welcome change, makes it very hard to accidentally hit them now. The camera is hands off the best phone-camera out there, nothing more to say there. Although the from camera is less than stellar. A few issues that still remain is that I want the headphone port at bottom and the micro-USB port on top of the device, it has it in opposite order, although to be fair every OEM is guilty of this offense, except only Apple is now putting headphone port at bottom. At least we get a camera button with windows phones. The phone is indeed a little heavy. 900 is my opinion had the perfect weight. While 920 has better ergonomics, I find it a little heavier than I would have like. But given the built quality, OIS camera, display quality, 32GB storage etc. being a little heavy is easy to forget.All in all, this is a WOW level of device.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A2V7BA4" id="B00A2V7BA4-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-04:</strong> I pre-ordered my cyan 920 so I've had it since launch. Like my Lumia 900, I'm not going to review the Windows Phone OS as much as I am going to focus on the hardware. In some cases, I am going to compare the 920 and 900.The good:- the display is smudge/fingerprint resistant;- the display resolution is a big improvement over the Lumia 900 (I believe it's slightly higher in pixel density over the iPhone 5);- the buttons and camera bezel/trim are scratch resistant;- the battery life is a significant improvement over the Lumia 900, but there is a caveat (see below);- the camera is a big improvement over the Lumia 900;- the wireless charging;The bad:- on a couple of occasions, the battery has mysteriously and rapidly drained itself. I don't know if this is a Windows Phone 8 bug or a Nokia firmware bug;- dust collects under the front facing camera;- the proximity sensor sometimes does not work (due to dust leaking in) so the screen stays dark during toast notifications or when trying to hang up a call. One fix is to blow air at the top of the phone where the front facing camera is;- there is a very, very, very tiny gap where the top of the display meets the chassis. I thought this was normal until I checked out my co-worker's red 920. His red 920 does not have this gap, however, the top of the chassis on his phone flexes and creaks when pressure is applied.Overall, I think the 920 is a good improvement over the 900. I'm a bit disappointed that flaws such as the dust getting behind the screen glass and the chassis creaks made it past testing and into production. Software issues can easily be fixed by software updates, but how do you fix hardware design flaws? Given that, I'm not sure I would recommend the 920.UPDATE - 2012-12-24I got tired of blowing compressed air daily to clear the proximity and front-facing camera and I contacted AT&T; to warranty it. Unfortunately, cyan is backordered.UPDATE - 2013-01-13I received my replacement 920 on Mon-Jan-7. While AT&T;'s warranty dept was nothing but accommodating, my original order was mysteriously cancelled. Luckily, I checked my order status daily; unfortunately, AT&T; didn't have a reason why my original order was cancelled.Anyway, I've had a week with the replacement 920 and so far, so good with the dust issue (there is no gap between the seal of the display and chassis). The biggest inconvenience was app and setting migration to the new unit. Windows Phone 8 has greatly improved the process over Windows Phone 7 -- it re-downloads all of your apps and it migrates most of the phone settings, but a lot of app settings and a few phone settings (i.e. tiles on homescreen) aren't migrated.The honeymoon is back and I've updated my rating.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A2V7BA4" id="B00A2V7BA4-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-23:</strong> UPDATE: I sure wish I had known this before giving up on Windows Phone 8...To soft reset the phone (just a restart without erasing any of the information on the phone): Press the Volume Down + Power keys at the same time for about 10 seconds.To hard reset the phone (deleting all the content and resetting the phone to like new status): Press the Volume Down + Power + Camera keys at the same time for at least 10 seconds.If the phone becomes stuck on the screen with two gears turning, follow the following instructions to successfully start the phone to the welcome screen:Normally, it takes only 30 minutes at most to hard reset it.

Success!______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Original Review:First, let me say that I am a huge Microsoft fanboy and I generally love their software and devices, even if there is a small glitch or deficiency. I have owned three different generations of Windows Phones over the course of nearly 2.5 years. I bought my first generation Windows Phone 7, the Samsung Focus, the week they came out. I never had any problems; it was rock solid, both hardware and software. My second Windows Phone 7.5, the HTC Titan, the week it came out. Again, I never experienced any problems; the hardware and software were without bugs, glitches, or defects.Needless to say, I was stoked to buy the Nokia 920. I followed all of the press events and unofficial leaks for months before its release. I bought three 920s the first day they were available (one for me, my Mom, and my Dad). Before I explain all of the problems, let me share some of the positives. The camera is superb. The screen is beautiful. The stereo speakers on the bottom are loud, clear, and the best I have ever heard on any cell phone. The call quality is superb on both speakerphone and earpiece. Nokia Music, Nokia City Lens and Nokia Drive are really unbelievable. Nokia Maps leave a bit to be desired, but they are better than iOS5. I truly wish these phones weren't ALL DEFECTIVE as I would really prefer to have kept it for the next year or two. As I describe in the following, the problems continue to mount on all four folks I know with the Nokia 920.The first week I had to exchange mine at the ATT store because it would not charge; although, later, I learned that the Nokia 920 is very finicky about getting a high amperage charge when its battery is very low. So, the first phone was not defective, and ATT store reps did not know to instruct me to use the OEM Nokia charger or a high amperage charger when the battery was very low. I also later found out that I could use a Belkin 2.1A car charger when the battery was very low; therefore, it was apparent the OEM charger is not necessary, but a high amperage charger is. That was the first return.In the second week, my Mom's phone began glitching when receiving text messages. Her phone would freeze and lock up with the text notification bar at the top of the screen. The fix was a soft reset, by holding the volume down + power button for a few seconds. But this happened several times and was not acceptable for a new phone. So we took hers back to the ATT store and exchanged it for another. This made phone #4 for us.Within a couple weeks I contacted Nokia Care to inform them that our phones were not outputting a sufficient volume and were not driving our external speakers around the house that we were familiar using with our other phones. We all purchased in-line headphone amplifiers to use so that we could get sufficient output. Luckily, an update released in December fixed this volume issue and we no longer needed our $30 worth of headphone amplifiers.About 25 days after purchasing, my second phone began having problems playing video podcasts. It was stuttering during playback. I contacted Nokia Care and they suggested I hard reset the phone, which deletes everything and returns the phone to like new status. When I reset the phone through the option under settings, reset your phone, it became stuck on the Nokia logo splash screen. I called ATT to get help and they said to soft reset the phone. It then rebooted and became stuck on two gears turning (boot splash screen). I called ATT back and they advised that the phone was "defective" and I needed to return it for warranty replacement. I had to pay $15 to get overnight shipping for the replacement. This was now my 3rd phone and #6 for the three of us in the family.Now just day before yesterday, I began experiencing the video playback stuttering with video podcasts. I tried deleting and unsubscribing the podcasts, then re-subscribing and re-downloading them. Unfortunately, the phone still stuttered during playback. I contacted Nokia Care and they advised me to soft reset the phone. It still stuttered. They then asked me to hard reset it; unfortunately, this would be the fourth time I had to set this phone back up from scratch. Although Windows Phone 8 does have backup and restore functionality, it is limited and does not restore the application data, login information for applications, podcast subscriptions, or the layout and setup of the live tile start screen. On reboot from the hard reset, the phone stuck on the gears turning splash screen (just like the last phone) and stayed there for nearly 15 minutes. I was still on the line with Nokia Care. They advised I do a soft reset. Again, it stuck on the gears turning screen for another 10 minutes. They then advised me to send my phone in for troubleshooting and warranty repair. They said that it could take up to 10 days for me to get a phone back in return. This was inexcusable considering the problems I had already experienced. I spent around an hour with Nokia Care with no resolution.I then called ATT again and was fortunate enough to get Jill who put me on hold as she contacted a supervisor. Upon my insistence she offered me the option to get an HTC 8X which I refused. She asked what I wanted and I said an Android phone. Today I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 out for delivery and I really hope to have a positive experience with it as it is my first Android phone.While on the phone I pointed out that my Mom's second phone is getting stuck on the notification bar, requiring a soft reset. It is also sending and receiving blank texts instead of the text that was part of the message. Her friends and family have experienced this with her phone many times (luckily not me or my Dad). The ATT rep suggested we exchange her phone again through free warranty (this will be her third 920). If Mom has more problems, hopefully ATT will give us exceptional support and allow her to exchange for a different OS and manufacturer.As a side note, I talked one of my friends into upgrading from her two year old Samsung Focus Windows Phone to a new 920 in November too. Hers froze on the Nokia splash logo on the highway on her way to a week out of town. She had to deal with a warranty replacement on vacation. Her second phone has gotten stuck on the Nokia screen once since the replacement. It stayed stuck on the Nokia logo until the internal battery ran out. Luckily the next morning, when she plugged it in to charge it, it restarted normally. She still continues to have problems with it occasionally freezing and restarting on its own. She is not happy with it and says she wishes she had kept her two year old Samsung Focus. She does concede that she loves the 920; if only it worked all the time.With all of these problems, the 10+ hours I have spent without a working phone, with Nokia Care, ATT service, warranty service, and researching issues on the web, I have become disgusted with Windows Phone 8. This is very sad considering I have always been Windows Phone's biggest fan and traveled through all three generations of the software and hardware.ADD 1/28/13: I reset Mom's phone before sending it back to the AT&T; warranty department. It became stuck on the gears rotating splash screen and stayed there for over two hours. I soft reset it twice, letting it 'spin its wheels for over an hour each. It never left the gear rotating screen. It never restarted back to the OS. So, this makes the third Nokia 920 that has bricked on that screen (four if you count my best friend Barbara's phone I talked her into buying). :(</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A2V7BA4" id="B00A2V7BA4-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-16:</strong> Dang ...!!This is the real Smartphone.A Well trusted company from mobile ages, classy, elegent design, great build quality, awesome battery life, Smooth Os, Tons of NECESSARY Apps.I was up for an upgrade and was deciding in Lumia 920 or Galaxy SIII.Since i am android fan i was up for Galaxy sIII until i looked at this phone in the stores and the hype it carried before prerelease on youtube.After watching review videos on youtube where in every video lumia 920 outsmarted galaxy SIII ( this is also a great phone :) ) i thought to give it a try. ( Also i was getting bored of Android and wanted a change .. No Not iphone for me ... thats the most dumbest phone i belive)Reasons :WP8 : Stable OS.Can't be compared with Android (Android is in the skies right now ... and W98 is climbing up) yes but the features it carries are awesome and well worth.WP8 is a win..!! Buttery Smooth OS No lag whatsoever unlike Android who made it now when they reached JB.The Ease of the OS is awesome anything you want just pin it and done.One of the best OS out there simply better in this segment than Android and IOS.Microsoft really wants to play it hard to compete GOOGLE and APPLE.Updates are preidic.App Store is less comptetive as compared to Google & Apple Apps Store but all the necessary apps are there.Its increasing dialy .. lot of apps are counted in as such.If you are nto App Frenzy and all the required apps you need, you can get it on Windows App Mkt.BATTERY LIFE:Android phones are awesome however the battery life sucks on those.I had 2 Android Phones i am well aware of it.But there are also reasons for that .. OS is much powerful and thus requires a lot of battery.NOKIA has always been a king in Battery Life.This is my 4th NOKIA phone. ( 3310, N72, N73 and now LUMIA 920 )I am getting 27hrs of battery life. ( Not Kidding ... M serious) with full use (4g lte, listening music while commuting, facebooking, transit maps and all)I just charge this phone during nights while sleeping thats it.I know few people are suffering from Battery Problem but dont blam the company the phones you may have got are unfortunately are defective.I think 17hrs+ battery life you can easily get on the lumia 920.Just let your phone drain 2-3 times intially and then go to go.NOKIA APPS :The best bundle one can get with WP8 Apps.This is a win.Lots of well trusted, awesome Nokia Apps which are your daily needs is a complete win.MUSIC : This Phones puts other music players and phones to shame.Insanely Awesome.MAPS : Offline navigation Oh boy... What else one needs.Touch Sensitivity is great so is the UI.Also if you are the fan of GOOGLE MAPS .. dont worry You have app Named GMaps which solves your purpose.Please APPLE MAPS cant be compared with these.They Suck.CITY LENS: This is a most innovative app in the mobile industry and is the best.Accurate Judgment.By far the best.CAMERA :Best Camera No Words... Watch Youtube for detailed reviews on this.Low Light Pics.. Now thats a innovation.1080P Video is just awesome.Nokia has always won in the Camera Segment i had a Nokia N73 with 3.2 mp carl zeis optics.That phone was the king... and had the best camera those days.Apps in Camera :All are good and awesome.If need all the advance settings go with Proshot App its a great App.MEMORY : 32 Gb Internal.Well that was never a concern for me. I personally feel 32gb is more than sufficient for us in our smartphones... unless people really want to put blu ray movies in their phones.I had Samsung Galaxy SII 16gb internal + 16gb External and i never crossed 25gb.So i am okay with it.DISPLAY :The display is gorgeous and PureMotion HD+ display (WXGA (1280  768) is just great.I know as per the CES 2013 all cell phones are coming with 1080p HD Display but still this Display is insanely awesome and does the work it needs to.Galaxy SIII's Display is not as good as Lumia 920s ... Agh.. Iphone .. damn i hardly care about it.I recommend this phone to anyone who wants to try to go with new OS and a Awesome Trusted Smartphone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A2V7BA4" id="B00A2V7BA4-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-06:</strong> Ok so if you are reading this you have decided on a windows phone.  So I will not go into that kettle of fish.The two phones I ordered direct from Amazon as the seller came quickly and in perfect condition.  I hate being on contracts so I wanted to be able to change carriers at will.The phones were easy to setup.  Before going over to ATT to get the micro sim cards I charged them up and joined them to my wifi network.  Software updates from Microsoft and Nokia were installed just fine.  I did it this way so I could be in and out of the ATT store quick.....and it worked.We are both very pleased with 920.  Screen resolution is wonderful and sound quality is superb.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A2V7BA4" id="B00A2V7BA4-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-01:</strong> Like many out there considering making a switch, I was hesitant about WP. I had an android phone and carried an iPad. I was happy with both platform and Windows seemed risky. Still, the clean design was appealing to me and I had been a fan of Windows Mobile in the past - going back to the original Palm-sized PC. I first made the switch with a Lumia 900 and the 920 improves on the experience.If your favorite thing about your phone is Instagram and Pandora, this is probably not for you. In my opinion, WP is the best mobile plaform out right now, but until it sells better, it will not be at the top of the list for developer attention. If you MUST have specific apps, check the app store and see if they are available. Be aware, there are lots of great alternative apps when very popular apps are missing that are also worth a look. But if all your friends are on instagram, that probably doesnt matter to you.The Lumia 920 has the best camera you will find on a cell phone right now. It works great in low light and video is smooth thanks to PureView. You have the ability to focus at very close range (macro) as well. The only thing I would wish for is more zoom, but lets not get greedy.Where this phone and WP in general shines is in the core functions. Email, web browsing, camera, navigation, messaging, are all top notch. Its even top of the class when it comes to making phone calls. The People Hub, as other's have mentioned is like nothing any other platform has to offer. From the people hub you can do things a normal contact app can do, plus see a feed of content from your facebook, twitter, linked-in and other networks. Like and comment facebook posts and retweet something all from a single unified feed. Select a contact and see a history of all your interaction with that person and all their recent social medai posts.Windows Phone puts more information at your fingertips. Nokia matches the platform to cutting edge, well-built, beautiful and durable hardware.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A2V7BA4" id="B00A2V7BA4-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-18:</strong> I've had Nokia Lumia 920 black for 9 days now, pre-ordered at att website on 11/7, l love it since day one.I've used it intensively day and night. Every piece of apps work excellently.Both hardware and software are implemented flawlessly. Top quality.Setup three yahoo email accounts,one Gmail,one hotmail,one Comcast email.New email messages are pushed to my home screen automatically with numbers.Tiles can be enlarged to show latest message, since I have too many email accounts,I use the smallest title on home screen.Nokia drive + is the fastest GPS navigation, it locks the satellites signals within 3 seconds.Only complaint is it won't announce the side of street at destination when I followed it to a at&t; store in west Dundee,Il.TomTom has the same issue but Garmin and iGuidance donot. Hope Nokia knows the issue and a fix is on the way.I downloaded maps for whole USA,Canada,China mainland and Hong Kong. It used up about 5 GB, it still leaves me 22 GBfor other purposes.I shoots a beautiful lake view HD video with gooses flying over and landing in the lake of Elgin,IL. Floating lens completely removed my hand shaking.Battery lasts me whole on intensive usage. I beleive for regular use, it can last 2 days for one full charge after twice cycling.I am writing the review from my Nokia Lumia 920 from ie10 web browser in mobile mode. oops, it auto sent out. let me continue from my laptop.I installed shopping apps like amazon, amazon kindle, ebay, cragslist,homedepot, gasbuddy. unfortunately there is no amazon wireless app. I used the ebay app and ordered a nokia battery for my wife, the experience is so fantastic, there is no need to bother my laptop at home via wifi or on the road on my 3GB data pro plan. it is kind of freedom. yes, I am liberated from my laptop by nokia lumia 920. I have more time with my family now.I installed banking apps like chase, bank of america, but citi is not there. Heard my complaint, citi ? I'll move my account to chase if you don't create a app for windows phone 8. actually chase app can also do the check deposit, I've already set it up and will deposit all my check payments to chase.I installed realtor and zillow apps for shopping houses. redfin is not available at the time of writing.oh, i forgot to mention yahoo email has an issue, it can not send out email for free email account except the one that is bound to sbcglobal.net (at&t; dsl account) even I set up exact smtp settings as sbcglobal.net. so obviously it is yahoo which intentionally disables free email account to send email via smtp server.Recently I went to shop a SFH, I used the PureView camera to take pictures of outside and inside of the single family house. it turned out excellent pics. no need to carry my huge Canon digial DSLR any more.finaly, I want to thank nokia, microsoft, att and mobile app developers to set me free from my garmin gps, lenovo laptop, canon DSLR camera, etc, let me have more time to stay with my family.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A2V7BA4" id="B00A2V7BA4-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-21:</strong> This is a great phone for your buck as compare to high end smartphone from apple, Samsung and blackberry, I will be buying a new smartphone and the release of this confuse me a little bit cause I decided to buy the Samsung galaxy s4, I did tried and tested this a week ago, the availability of Microsoft office suit, the GPS which I believe is pretty good comparable to my Magellan and garmin GPS. For GPS functionality alone you can save between 150 to 200 dollars by buying this phone, how about the availability of office suit wherein you can edit you document anyplace without going to your computer table or notebooks that is another 100 dollars savings, The camera feature is pretty good also. If this phone will cost you 450 dollars you deduct the saving from gps say 150 dollars plus say 50 dollars for the Microsoft office suit that is 200 dollars meaning you are only paying 250 dollars for LUMIA 920. I have magellan App's on my old iphone 3gs and it cost me $60.00, for nokia lumia the GPS is included for FREE, What is great about the NOKIA built in GPS is it is worldwide, my friend was able to use the nokia LUMIA GPS in ASIA. NOW I AM CONFUSE WILL DECIDE SOON WHETHER I WILL GET THIS ONE OR THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S4. I am a heavy user of Microsoft office suit and GPS for my daily routine. Since I have IPAD, IPHONE 3GS, I think I can have this phone so that I can access my word document anytime and in any places. I ever I decide to buy this phone I will use this together with my ipad and will maintain my old iphone for my other apps. The windows app's are not good enough and very few populars apps are available.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A2V7BA4" id="B00A2V7BA4-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-20:</strong> I'm so happy of this Phone.

Purchased from AT&T corporate store about 5 days ago.  I have not used a Windows phone since the PocketPC days and switched from an Iphone 5.  Did not have a whole lot to transfer over except for contacts from Google which occurred flawlessly.  I was able to hook up Bluetooth to my Acura without a problem.  Calls are clear and plenty loud.  The screen is exceptional and does work with gloves which is a tremendous plus when skiing.  I like the live tiles, only some apps have this function.  I had a problem for awhile transferring my DMR free music from Itunes on my MacBook pro until I checked the box in the Windows Phone Software for Mac, "Allow Access to Folder".  The one issue I have is streaming over Bluetooth.  The sound is terrible especially in the car and the volume is extremely low.  I am 59 and do not play music so everyone within 20 feet can hear it,  but I do want to hear it over the treadmill.  I purchased the Jaybird Sportsband just before Christmas.  Worked great with Iphone 5.  With the Nokia the sound is muddied, kind of mono sounding, and volume is low with both the phone and headset cranked up.  The phone has no sound controls for wireless headsets and does not support all features apparently that the headset might have.  I found that if I turn the volume down using the Sportsband, the phone stays maxed at 30 and I cannot use the Sportsband to turn the volume back up.  I have to delete the device from the Bluetooth app and then sync it again.  When I get home on Friday I will try it with 3 other Wireless headsets I have, but I have a feeling that this is a Win 8 software limitation at the moment.  For me this is a big limitation as I have been wireless for awhile now and play music solely over Bluetooth.  I will try the Sportsband with another Win 8 phone at the store along with the display Nokia 920 to see if my phone has a problem or again if this is a Win 8 phone limitation.  Other than the Bluetooth function the phone works great and the screen is very nice.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A2V7BA4" id="B00A2V7BA4-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-06:</strong> I am a early adopter of this phone. Before att released the phone, i bought developer edition off ebay, though It was very expensive on ebay.My first impression on the hardware was WOW. The build quality had exceeded my expectations.I had used almost all generations of iphones including Iphone 5. But being bored with same interface i changed to lumia 900 and then to lumia 920. though hardware on lumia 920 exceeded my expectations, but not windows 8. All windows 8 previews has exaggerated the features. In real life there are very few in windows 8 which are useful. Regarding apps, the stock is low ,it has to come up with more. Before buying i know all this but wanted to try it any way. Low light photography is great. NFC is not that useful as of now.Regarding the gorilla glass 2, i watched all videos on youtube where user scratched the phone with knife,keys and hammer. But a simple rub (accidental) of phone on my hard floor made scratches on the phone screen. I was disappointed on this. But i installed screen protector which has hidden most scratches .Any way I still recommend the phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A2V7BA4" id="B00A2V7BA4-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-11:</strong> This is simply the best phone I have ever had.

Even the factory repair didn't fix a log of things.  Their GPS loses connection often.  The offline maps are really not offline ( you can't search).  Drops calls like crazy in california.  I see 4-5 bars in other phones with at&t where this phone shows only 2-3 bars or lower.  No service bug. Often goes out and displays "no service".  After dealing with Nokia so many times, they're giving a run around without any fix for the problem. I really wanted to return this phone to them, and get my money back!  The phone seems fast and shiny, but that's about it.  I regret my purchase! Should have gone with HTC or some other windows phone.  The main thing is the phone call quality and gps quality. And if that doesn't work well, everything else is of no use.  Doesn't make sense to carry this heavy brick around compared to other phones.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A2V7BA4" id="B00A2V7BA4-review21" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-16:</strong> Every other review has covered all the big stuff so I recommend you read several of them, but let me tell you about the small stuff. They have changed the tell me network voice and have added a male voice. These now have a richer sound and more intonation than before, the network seems faster at processing the dictation and I would say I am noticing better accuracy. I use TellMe with a wired headset many, many times a day everyday and it has become an important part of how I get things done. Since I have my headset in all day long the ability for developers to use the TellMe API's in their apps is huge. I can use my voice to open apps and perform tasks in those apps. For example I can use my voice to open Audible and start my book playing without ever looking at my phone.Next their are some great improvements to texting in the phone. They now are not only predicting what word you are typing but what word you may intend to type next. I found this very useful and a pleasing surprise as I never saw this feature update get any press.Let me just cover the criticism of the weight I have seen out there, by saying it is not really an issue when compared to the feel of solidness you get when handling the phone.The phones screen is amazing I kept putting drops of water on it when I first got it to see if I could see pixels when magnified and I still could not. The speed of the screen really makes itself apparent when scrolling black text on a white back ground, there is no blur when the text is in motion.The camera is truly the sweet spot for me, I take a lot of photos and many of them indoors or in poor light and that is where this camera shines. And the ability to have images auto-upload to ShyDrive at full resolution is great.I will amend this as I spend more time with the phone.***edit***01/23/13I have spent more time with the phone and have now changed my rating to five stars. Nokia have updated the camera and nearly every Nokia app several times in the last month and half. They have taken a great phone camera and made it that much better. Nokia took care of the issues with daytime photos and sped up the taking of dark photos.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A2V7BA4" id="B00A2V7BA4-review22" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-07:</strong> Had to return the phone. There are quite a number of major flaws that are not acceptable for 2013 smartphone's standards. BATTERY LIFE IS HORRIBLE. Nokia packed so much tech, and a huge battery but that still didn't help. A lot of headphones with built-in mic don't work. Volume sometimes works only for music and not for phone ringtone, and vise versa. Still no Apps. LTE works like crap on AT&T;, and I only had 9Mbs down while my friends iPhone 5 on AT&T; same LTE was getting close to 22MBs!!! Nokia maps and Bing integration just blows more than Apple's Maps fiasco. I searched for a club that was 2 blocks away from me, the phone found another club, 5 miles away with different name. For a smartphone, it's quite dumb. Micro USB cable charges fast only if you use the one that came with the phone, which is BS. Typing is not faster than iPhone and way behind than Android Jelly Bean keyboard. Voice commands sound more like a gimmick and had no real use for me, maybe for someone who's blind or disabled, even then it doesn't understand what you tell the phone to do.Microsoft is loosing the game quite badly, come on. Software company with so much development and research can figure these things out.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00A2V7BA4', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00A2V7BA4', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00BUIG6E0</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00BUIG6E0</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BUIG6E0" id="B00BUIG6E0-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-20:</strong> This is my third case for the S4 and hopefully the last.It is a very stylish look and allows for docking with all galaxy docks.

The only problem with the aux connection is if you're using a splitter. I have three different splitters and none of them fit now with this particular case. This won't be a problem for most, so not a huge deal. The grip is also a bit lacking as it's relatively smooth vs. other cases.

It is very thin and lightweight so it feels like there is almost no case at all. The buttons are very easy to press. There is a lift on the front so you can lay your phone face down, and the camera has a raise over it as well so it will not get damaged. I have an otterbox defender and you have to mash so hard to push the buttons and it makes the phone HUGE this case is much better. I have tried them ALL and hands down this is the best. Take my advice and buy this first and save yourself some money on having to buy more cases in the future, it stays clean no fingerprints. I ordered this case on a Monday and received it the following Monday. I live in louisiana and it shipped from new jersey if that helps!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BUIG6E0" id="B00BUIG6E0-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-26:</strong> It does the job, but I was hoping for a more grippy material.

It's slimmer and lighter (8g lighter) than the Spigen and fits perfectly. I really like the build quality and how it covers side buttons without making them harder to push. Another great feature is how roomy the cutouts for the ports are and the rubberized frame that makes it easy to grip on to.At this price range, it is the best anyone out there can find.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BUIG6E0" id="B00BUIG6E0-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-12:</strong> Great case, I love it so much I want to buy another one.

I case mine up on most nights and weekends, but carry it without a case on boring workdays in the office. It couldn't be easier with this case.I've had mine (white) for over a month, and it still looks brand new. No discoloration, it's not scuffable (not easily, anyways), and no cracks or bends.I love this case. I'll definitely keep an eye out for OEM cases going forth...

It's very stylish, fitting the lines of the phone perfectly, as you'd expect from an OEM case and the material build quality generally feels much higher quality than that of either of the Spigen's and equal to that of the Incipio, with perhaps a few points above the Incipio in some areas.What I like most about the case is that it's not overly slippery thanks to its rubberized sides, matches the phone quite well and the lip size is arguably the best of any case. It's not too slim (like the Spigen to me) that it seems like it offers little to no protection if placed face down and it's not too thick like some of the more protective cases (Incipio DualPro) that it may hinder with gestures or the home button. The back of the case is also slightly padded for added protection and I've gotten some comments that people didn't even realize a case was on the phone because of the look. Very nice indeed.Because it's a hard case, it's slightly heavier than the Incipio DualPro and equal to the Spigen Slim Armor. The buttons are a little stiff, much like the Spigen as well, but not uncomfortably so. The material is more of a matte finish with sheen, whereas the Spigen Slim Armor is straigh glossy. In my option, this case by Samsung wins here and if you had to choose between this and the Spigen Slim Armor, go with the Samsung one unless gloss is your thing. It's hard to compare with the Incipio because that case offers more protection. As it stands, I use the Samsung case as my daily driver and I kept the Incipio for days I want a little more protection.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BUIG6E0" id="B00BUIG6E0-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-14:</strong> This is hands down the best case for the S4.

I also have a casemate slim case with a similar design and a smoke colored TPU case by amazon basics but ever since I recieved this case, it has been my primary case.  The navy blue color is awesome and slightly metallic looking which is cool. It actually looks better in person than in the photos. Also, this case is very thin! It's as thin as my TPU case... which was a total surprise because my casemate slim case is much thicker than this either of those cases. Although I'm usually not a fan of cases which cover up the buttons on the sides, this case allows the buttons to work perfectly without having to push any harder on them. In fact, the buttons work just as good inside the case... another great surprise. You even still get that tactile feel/feedback when you are pushing down the buttons. This leads me to believe that they spent lots of time and energy making and perfecting the look, feel, and functions of this case!  The fit is perfect and it's very easy to put this thing on and off the phone.Another good example is that the bumper material that goes around the sides and extends over the screen a bit has a nice slightly rubbery feel to it that makes the case feel nice in my hands and more grippy. The material itself is substantial enough to offer some protection for the sides and screen. I found this out by accidentally dropping my phone off of my table at work... about a 3 foot fall onto the hard floor!  It landed on it's top right side first, and then flipped onto the screen side down.  My phone survived unscathed! Although the case did get a tiny scuff on the rubbery side that it landed on, I was very happy that my phone was protected.All in all, this may be the most perfect cell phone case I have ever owned. To make that statement is a huge deal for me... and I have owned many, many phone cases through the years. It was exactly what I was hoping for in a phone case... something very well designed, attractive, perfect fit, slim, and offers good protection.  Because it meets all of these requirements, I feel that I must give it a full 5 Stars.  I would really recommend it to anymone. The only thing I wish is that the case came in even more colors. For example, dark teal, burgundy red, and hunter green :)Pros:-Superb design, fit and finish-Ports are all easily accessible.-Bumper around sides and screen provide good protection and added grip.-Very slim!  About the same thickness as those transparent TPU cases-Great paint job on the navy blue. It looks slightly metallic too, which is awesome.-Buttons are covered by case but their functions aren't impeded by the design at all! They work just as good with the case on. This was a big suprise because I usually like cases with open button ports.Cons:-Nothing. This case is amazing.  Samsung did a great job designing it!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BUIG6E0" id="B00BUIG6E0-review19" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-15:</strong> This case is very slim and protects the phone great.

It covers all around the sides of the phone with flexible TPU and the back has an attached (non-removable) plastic plate that's probably a little thicker than it needs to be, however I'm fine with the extra protection.The dark blue case works very well with the &#34;Black Mist&#34; color phone. The TPU part is the same color as depicted in the pictures, but the back plate is a lighter, almost shimmering dark blue that I'm very much a fan of.The phone is very secure in the case, doesn't move but is also relatively easy to remove, if need be.The edges of the TPU part have a very slight lip to protect your phone if you ever decide to place it face-down but don't wrap around the front too much. WIth that said, it works almost perfectly with my Spigen SGP Glas.tr case.However, if you like cases with a little added grip, you might want to consider other options. Both the plastic and TPU parts of the case are pretty slick, which is nice for sliding in and out of pockets, but my increase your chances of dropping it. I haven't personally had this problem, and I'm very much fine with the way that the phone feels.5/5, definitely recommended.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BUIG6E0" id="B00BUIG6E0-review25" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-27:</strong> Fits perfectly, no slipping or "peeling" on the edges, protects back & edges from minor falls & mishaps.

It def is not worth the price paid for it. It was only holding that price due to the fact that it was a Samsung product. In the end, I would think that since they know how popular their phones are and how well they need to be protected, they would have come up with something a little better than this.

Some are very soft, some are very grippy and won't slip.  The ones you don't want are the ones that are too pliable like a wet noodle, because they will slip or peel right off the phone.  You also don't want one that is too rigid, because those are not very grippy and so you might drop the phone.  This one is neither too limp, or too rigid. It comes in a lot of colors, too.

The back is slippery, so it slides on the leather seats in my car, unless I place it face down. The disadvantage to the display being face down is obvious.2. The "back" protrudes beyond the rubber bumper, which is largely the reason for the problem with 1. above, but secondarily, after just 3 weeks of use, the seemingly "painted" on finish is already scratched and appears worn.3. I ordered Navy, the closest color to my black phone (it is probably more gunmetal black) but the back of the "case" is not navy nor gunmetal.My suggestion, simply skip the back, and sell a rubber "bumper".Pro 2 for those like me, who have used a belt clip/holster for over 20 years: the case allows for use in a holster, like the Seidio.B00CBSZ5AE</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BUIG6E0" id="B00BUIG6E0-review46" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-25:</strong> Very nice and slim, fits the S4 perfectly with no issues.

It fits tight but install was easy and quick. Quality looks and for me actually improves the phone - I can pick it up easier, work the buttons easier, and set it down quicker because now it's protected. The camera area glass was getting scratched a little before, thankfully not over the actual lens, but still it was not cool on your brand new phone.

It has a nice feel to it, not too grippy and not slick, again...perfect balance!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BUIG6E0" id="B00BUIG6E0-review48" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-23:</strong> I like covers that are as unobtrusive as possible both in design and feel, and for the price, in my opinion this is the best cover available for the Galaxy S4. The fit is superb, and all the buttons retain nice feedback (albeit ever so slightly mushy for those sensitive enough to tell). It is not bulky at all, which has led some to question how protective it is. The short answer is that it's protective enough for me. If you drop your phone a lot, perhaps an Otterbox is a better choice.Some complain of the back of this case being slippery, but I didn't find that to be a problem. The sides are a TPU-like soft yet firm silicone, while the back is a hard, glossy plastic that mimics the back of the Note 2 (I say the Note 2 because I find that back to be more slippery than the S4). Because the sides of this case have grip, I never felt my S4 was in danger of slipping out of my hand.Due to the nature of having a hard plastic back, this cover does scratch over time. The white fares a little better than the darker blue (which I had on my Note 2), but both scratch.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BUIG6E0" id="B00BUIG6E0-review49" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-12:</strong> Great unusual color, the navy blue.

I'm not sure how this can help with drops or bumps, but it's good enough for everyday mishaps. This covers the whole phone, including volume buttons and power key. All other buttons are carefully accessible, so nothing should get &#34;stuck&#34; by the cover, even that IR sensor.I personally prefer this type of case, which puts a layer, to further protect the camera lens, when placed on a flat surface. The covers that replace the phone's battery cover will not protect the camera lens, in my opinion. I just don't think the camera lens is Gorilla Corning glass, that's all.You should be aware that even though it says White, the edges are gray.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BUIG6E0" id="B00BUIG6E0-review53" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-21:</strong> Fits perfectly, not too bulky, and makes the phone easier to hold onto.

What drives me bonkers is the mess of cables I find in my car because everyone in my family has different generation iPhones or iPods. I can't leave out the speakerphone and GPS that uses a different USB cable as well.The Wecharger has put a stop of having for all those cables. Now my son can charge his iPod Touch 4G and hubby his iPhone 4S with the 30 pin adapter. My daughter and I can use the 8-pin for our iPhone 5S we each have and the micro USB comes in handy to charge my GPS, digital camera and speakerphone. I can't leave out the iPads which we have different generations, so the 8-pin and 30-pin will be both come in handy for those as well . One charging cable to use to charge some many different kinds of devices - yeah that is what I call handy. Can't forget to mention the cool looking lights that make it look like &#34;energy&#34; is flowing into the charger then transporting to your devices.Really cool and practical item to have. These would make excellent gifts.Sample for review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00ITI6L1M" id="B00ITI6L1M-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-10:</strong> I have cables all over the place, including a few that simply wouldn&#8217;t work with any of my Apple devices. One time I ordered a 30-pin cable for my first generation iPad and was way unhappy when it wasn&#8217;t recognized. I was told on the screen, in no uncertain terms, that &#8220;Charging is not supported with this accessory.&#8221; I may as well have thrown my money out the window.What I especially like, in addition to the instant recognition of the cable, is the fact that I can charge three different types of devices. The cable is not sufficiently heavy-duty to support more than one device at the same time and is not probably not intended to. As soon as I plugged in the 8-pin Lightning pin to my iPad Air, I head the very familiar &#8220;blink&#8221; and it began to charge.The unique, but not essential visible flow of current is rather cool and I do love it. I&#8217;ve had this cable for a couple of months and it continues to perform as expected. Fast, efficient, and ultra-useful. The only problem is that when I use the 8-pin, I have to maneuver it a bit around my case to get it in the port. Otherwise, I&#8217;m very pleased with this cable.Sample provided for review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00ITI6L1M" id="B00ITI6L1M-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-26:</strong> This charger came as such a blessing! It can charge the three devices that I need to charge every single day - iPhone, iPad (I have an iPad 2), and Kindle. I wasn't too sure about the quality when I first read the reviews, but after having used the product for a week, I am very pleased with it. it works better than I had expected. The cable has a USB port on one side to plug into a USB adapter or a PC/Mac for charging. The other end has three prongs - the 30-pin adapter, lightning adapter, and a micro-usb adapter. I have not charged all three devices simultaneously yet, but my phone and iPad charge together pretty well. The lighted cable seemed strange at first, but now I am used to it. I personally prefer the cables did not light up so that I could use the cable on my bedside, but it's not a major deal breaker for me. The neat thing is that once the devices are charged, the cable stops blinking.Keep in mind that the cable is not Apple certified, but I have been using non-MFI cables for a several years now and have never had a problem. MFI cables just tend to be double the price of these ones, while these work just as well.Very neat way to keep the desk clutter free with just one cable. Also eliminates the need to have multiple USB adpaters.

Didn't they always light up?  This cable, while reducing your total charging current a bit, certainly does look cool and is a lot of fun.  You will certainly get comments when people see the power &#34;flowing&#34; from you USB port into your cell phone.  It is also convenient to have 3 outputs on the end so you can charge micro-USB, 30-pin, and lightning devices with 1 cable.  You can't do them all at the same time, but it allows you to carry just 1 cable in general.  It's also cool that the blue LED light show stops when the device is fully charged, a really handy feature.  The lightning connector is a bit stepped and extended, so I had no issues plugging it into my iPhone 5S even when inside a moderately sized AmazonBasics case.Recommended fun and frivolous cable that is also quite useful.Note: I received a free sample for the purposes of review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00ITI6L1M" id="B00ITI6L1M-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-22:</strong> This probably my favorite charging cable right now!

It appears as though the cable can only differentiate a 1 amp charge from a slower rate of power. It would have been nice for an additional mode to detect a 2 amp power flow. It also had a noticeable plastic smell when I took it out of its packaging.But - and this is a big but - the cable is NOT Apple certified and it will apparently no longer work with Apple devices running the latest iOS updates.

It still charges my iPod4 and other non-Apple devices, but take note before buying._________________________________________Useful and hypnotizing, this three headed charging cable has a plug that works with the new Apple lightning connectors (8 pin) for iPhones, iPads, iPods, a plug that works with the old Apple connector (30 pin) for iPhones, iPads, iPods and a micro USB connector.These three different plugs eliminate the need for three separate cables, but an added feature is the visually interesting cord with flowing blue lights running its 31 1/2 inch length simulating the electrical current charging the device.I could only charge one device at a time but, conveniently, the flow of the lights slowed and then stopped altogether serving as a highly noticeable indicator when charging is complete. The lights also stop cascading down the cable when the device being charged is unplugged.Performance-wise, all three plugs charged devices without issue, and I had no problem with the cable running hot - at either end of the cord - it all remained cool after hours of use.  The package was tightly sealed when I received it -- clearly a new product.Are the running blue lights necessary? No, but they are mesmerizing to watch and ridiculous in the best possible way.

It has one head with three connectors: micro USB, 30-pin, and lightning. When I charge anything, lights run up the cable to the device, showing the flow of energy. When the charge is slower, the lights move more slowly. When the charge stops, the lights disappear. Love! Now, I know that my devices are charging without having to turn them on or looking for a tiny blink.This isn't a cable you want in your bedroom at night. It's quite bright when you see it in the dark, and there's no way to turn the lights off. In bright daylight, I have the opposite problem. I can't see the running lights for the life of me. If we want to see the lights, we have to use the cable indoors or at night.So far, I've used the cable to charge my iPhone 4S and my tablets and power banks. The only problem I foresee is the micro USB and lightning sides need a lot of clearance. If the case you are using doesn't have much clearance around the micro USB or lightening port, you may have to remove the case.I did try to use the cable for data. It isn't good for that, but as a charging cable, it's great. I don't have to carry around multiple cables or adapters, and I like seeing my devices charge.This product was provided for review by SeaglePower.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00ITI6L1M" id="B00ITI6L1M-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-26:</strong> I received this for free but despite that I'll give my candid thoughts below.* Cute visual gimmick that certainly impressed the kids* Three-way plug services iPhone 4, 5 and micro USB but not all at once.

Plug the USB end into your computer or any wall charger. Plug the cable into the proper device and boom, it begin charging.I would recommend not using this in a room where you hope to get some sleep. The flashing light at night could be a distraction you don't want to deal with.In terms of charge capability, I only have an iPhone 5s, nothing with the 30 pin connector. I do, however, have plenty of microUSB chargeable devices. Having the iPhone and my Lumia 1020 plugged in, when I wake up in the morning, both are fully charged.

The phone and it's OEM Samsung Slim Fit case fit in it well.  As others have alluded to, it does get damp from sweat.  That's a fact; it's only made of cloth so I'd expect no different.The main issue with the product is the headphone cord velcro holster.  Again, I haven't used it much and it barely sticks anymore.  I don't expect it to hold at all after a couple more uses.  The velcro also catches the non-velcro material used elsewhere on the band, leaving it frayed (material/stitching) in areas that a quality product shouldn't.Volume/power buttons were very hard to find/press.  On screen functions are acceptable, but absolutely useless while you're wearing it (screen faces away from you), espeically in mid-run.I wouldn't wear an armband when weightlifting period.  It just gets in the way.I did a lot of research.

Knock-on and touch screen functions are unusable when in the case facing up, and the headphone port doesn't line up well.  I'm able to fit my phone with Ditztronic slim case, but it's snug.To get around the touchscreen problems, just turn the case upside down so that the open end part of the sleeve is facing upward.  Insert your phone so that it's upside down on your arm, but still readable if you were to look down.This does two things.  First, the proximity sensor near the top of the phone is no longer covered since the fabric edge doesn't cover it in this position.  This is what makes your touchscreen not work, since I suppose it thinks it's in your pocket or up to your ear.  Secondly, it lets you plug in your headphones on the big open portion instead of hunting around in the little misplaced hole on the bottom.I've used my tunebelt for a little while now without any real issues.  It can be awkward to operate your phone on your arm, but I generally just set it and forget when I start my run.  I can reach under the bottom use the buttons, but knock-on works for me as long as the proximity sensor isn't covered.  I use my headset with in-line controls to answer calls, change volume, or pause/change music tracks.Aside from the issues specific to the G2, it does run a bit smaller than suggested.  My arm is around 16.5&#34;, and this band was VERY tight.  I had to take it off during my first run, but luckily I knew someone who had an extension band they weren't using, which has been working great.I'm giving this product 4 stars because it's seeming well constructed, but too universal to really fit a phone correctly.  I'm sure there's a phone out there that this works great on, but for the G2 you'll need to put it in upside down.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0071C9B0U" id="B0071C9B0U-review23" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-16:</strong> Not having any luck finding a decent armband for my Galaxy S2, I was hoping this would fit the bill. The armband definitely does it's job but here is what it lacked for me.-Not enough room if you have an existing case on the phone (my current case adds minimal bulk)-Has very short strapI can handle taking my case on and off whenever I use the band, the band size is just way too small. I'm not that big of a guy for it to have to feel so snug.

I do have a thin TPU case on my phone, and it will fit with it, but it's super tight and a bit of a struggle.

The top flap does cover the phone with some effort, but even without the top covering the phone, it will not come out during a run. A small push from the bottom and the phone will come out when you want it to come out. The armband does not bounce when running and is very comfortable. The flap does a good job holding extra headphone cord, but in all honesty, if that flap was about 1/4 longer, it would be easier to use.The Armband is made out of neoprene , so it is not weatherproof. As other reviewers have pointed out, sweat can and does seep in from the back. If this is a concern for you, try using a plastic ID holder (Officemate Holders Vertical Inches 37004behind the phone. This will also allow you to carry an ID with you when out for a run.Also, as mentioned the Armband is somewhat small. My arms at about 14&#8221; around when flexed.

I use my naked Galaxy S4 with the wireless charging cover in this armband.  The wireless charging cover makes the GS4 a bit thicker and it fits fine.  I've also test fitted a GS4 with theOtterbox Defender case.  It doesn't fit with the full case, however if will fit with some effort if you take the outside rubber casing off the Defender case and leave the hard plastic on the phone.The Android 4.3 release for the GS4 enabled ANT+ wireless functionality.  I'm waiting for the Garmin 910XT replacement so in the meantime I like using this armband and apps to connect to myANT+ heart rate strap monitorandANT+ footpod.  It's a great combo that can alleviate the purchase of expensive GPS watches.I don't run in the rain with this armband.  There is a large top slot to slip your phone into and rain can just pour into it.  When running on some warm days with the armband against my skin, there was a good amount of moisture inside the neoprene jacket and on the inside of the plastic window.  I was a little concerned that this might cause an issue over time.I don't use that silly earphone cable tab on the left side.  It's a bit misplaced coming out the side- on the GS4 your earphones would come out the top.When running in cold weather I use a wind jacket and this armband does not stay in place well on my upper arm.  It slips down to my elbow, so I either need to cinch the strap very tight or keep my elbow bent  so it doesn't fully slip off my arm.  The armband should probably be redesigned to use some rubber grips on the inside to keep this from happening.  Or else there should be a different model to chose from that has this feature in case you wear slippery athletic clothes.When pressing on-screen buttons I often have to press them many times.  The plastic window gets in the way.  I don't use a screen protector on the phone.  The power and volume buttons are difficult to depress on purpose, yet they unexpectedly get depressed on accident.  I only start/stop my exercise so I don't look at it much.This armband works for my purposes and I'll continue to use it.  it's not perfect, but it was inexpensive so I'm OK with it for the time being and not looking for an alternative.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0071C9B0U" id="B0071C9B0U-review28" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-18:</strong> Even with the film on the front its very easy to us the touch screen.

I'll bet you won't find too many other arm bands for your phone that randomly adjust the volume while you're running! Imagine: you're jogging happily down the sidewalk, your Samsung GS3 ensconced withing your Tune Belt Sport Armband for Samsung Galaxy S3, S4 and More(tm) when suddenly the music coming through your earbuds is cranked up to eleven! Hilarity ensues as you go zig zagging down the sidewalk, trying frantically to turn the volume back down. But no, your flailing only increases the volume further! Ho ho ho, what a merry sight!For variety's sake, your Tune Belt Sport Armband will sometimes close the program or activate voice mode on your phone, interrupting the music without warning and making you fight with the phone on your arm through the protective plastic covering, trying to re-open the program you were in!Tune Belt knows you like buying stuff, so they made sure that the standard arm band will not fit most adult male arms and feels like a tourniquet. That way you get to buy an additional extended arm band which adjusts poorly and causes the case to slip!Words cannot describe my love for this quality product after jogging a couple of times with it. Now if you'll excuse me, I am going to go poke my eyes out with forks!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0071C9B0U" id="B0071C9B0U-review32" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-07:</strong> Really happy that I bought this arm band.

I also like the small Velcro flap that you see in the picture:  it lets me tuck in the slack headphone cord so it doesn't bounce around when I run.Unfortunately, the only way to get the Galaxy SIII into the Sport Armband is to take it out of my protective cover and slip just the phone in.  I can somewhat easily use the touchscreen through the clear plastic, but I don't expect the body of this armband to protect the phone very well if I drop it.I do sweat a LOT, but so far I haven't soaked the thing enough to make me worry about my phone--the compartment slips the phone in through the top and it doesn't seem that my SIII is going to slide out.Overall, this is a very good case, just with the caveat that I have to take my phone out of its cover to put it in.NOTE:  This review was posted under the Sport Armband for Samsung Galaxy S3, S4, and more.

This is same specs as the OEM Apple 30-Pin Connector that originally came with my Apple devices.  The main difference is that the iSmooth cable is cheaper and comes in varying lengths.  The iSmooth cable is also Apple MFI Certified, which means it has gone through rigorous Apple certified testing to ensure capability and performance.This cable is compatible with iPhone 3, iPhone 3s, iPhone 4, iPhone 4s, iPad, iPad2, iPad3, iPod classic and iTouch.  I tested this on my iTouch, iPhone 4s, and iPad 2 and didn't have any issues to speak of, same as using the original OEM cable.This cable also comes with a no question asked 10 year replacement warranty.  If you think this is something you wouldn't end up needing, think again.  I stepped on the 30-pin connector side of my OEM cable and ended up cracking it, it still worked but I no longer trust it with my $300+ device.  So 10 year warranty is a plus.Overall, I am greatly pleased with this product.  I can't tell the difference between the iSmooth cable and the Apple OEM cable.  I highly suggest if you are planning on buying a new cable to make sure it is Apple MFI Certified to protect your investment in your device.

The output is rated at 750 mA, which seems to work OK as long as the devices aren't too low on power.  It also has some problem fully charging my Evo, but I suspect that is due to the nearly 2 year old battery.  The only charger that will hit 100% is the HTC 1 amp charger at this point.This is about the same size as the Apple iPhone charger but with a second charging port and folding plug.  It fits easily into my briefcase and doesn't snag on things like the Apple charger plug can.If you need a tiny charger that can charge two things, this little guy can fill the bill.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007THM9R4" id="B007THM9R4-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-24:</strong> I use this on an almost daily basis.

Out of the blue, the phone wouldn't charge when plugged into the computer, or any of my other USB wall adapters.  The Extravert has issues; it only likes to be charged using the cord it came with.  OEM and other fitting cords wouldn't work; I did have some luck for a little while using a USB charging pad, but that eventually stopped working as well. I also tried to charge it in the car using a USB adapter for the cigarette lighter, which also, wouldn't charge the phone.  I really only purchased this item, admittedly from another website, because it was a 2 pack and one can't have enough adapters.  Out of desperation, I began attempting to charge trying the variety of adapters I currently have, which, none worked, but, this is the only adapter that can used to charge my phone!  I keep one at home and one at work.

The reason is that the printing on the device says 750mA, presumably split between the 2 USB ports. Compare that to a modern smartphone charger that is at least 1000mA for only one port. This Motorola charger will charge your phone eventually, but really really slowly. That maybe OK if you can let it charge all night (at least 8 hours). Don't bother if you need a fast charge at an airport or coffee shop. And don't even think of using this with a tablet. Tablet chargers are usually 2000mA or more and those still take a while to charge up.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007THM9R4" id="B007THM9R4-review37" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-13:</strong> i used this thing everyday it's a good charger, it charges 2phones at the same time. but charge faster with one phone at a timewith 2 phones it charges slower. but it's works wonderful.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007THM9R4" id="B007THM9R4-review38" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-30:</strong> This was the same as the charger that came with my RAZR.

I have found however that one of the ports isn't sufficient to charge an Iphone 5 - get a message that says not compatible.  Changing to the other port does not produce an error.  Not sure why, but past experience is that the power coming out of the ports is probably different different per port - in other words, 1 port might be 1000ma and the other port might be 2000ma.  For non-iphone 5, it will charge both items without an error on the device.  Ports are not labelled (or my mature eyes cannot see any indication of which port does what).  For the money, even if only 1 port worked, it would be worth it.  Since it is a Motorola part, it is REALLY worth it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007THM9R4" id="B007THM9R4-review52" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-14:</strong> I can't speak for everyone, but as micro USB devices start to add up throughout the house, having extra chargers becomes a nice option.  These work with any USB cable and are nicely done.  I paid $3ish for the one's I bought & they exceeded expectations.  These aren't the cheapo crap you see at the checkout counter at Walgreens or 7-11,  These are OEM quality items.  And these are cheaper than that Walgreens/7-11 crap too.Bonus:  They come with OEM quality cables (4' or so), or at least mine did.  The product description didn't really mention them, so it was a pleasant surprise.To be fair, anything up to around $10 would probably be a fair price when you consider what junk sells for everywhere.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007THM9R4" id="B007THM9R4-review53" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-18:</strong> I bought this so I could charge my iPhone and iPad at the same time while travelling.

Once you pry the gray top off, which will probably damage it, there are two black clips on either side of the circuit-board.

This means it will not charge your battery properly, and could reduce the lifespan.  On top of that, the creepage distance on the 120-240V mains side of the charger is TERRIBLE, it is honestly completely unsafe.

The display is a nice touch, and it's always nice to see how charged the battery is, however the little charging contacts are the problem.  On other wall chargers I've owned these contacts have always been a problem due to the fragile wiper contacts will loose their tension.  On this charger the contacts appear to be better from a tension point of view.  They use a pin and spring setup, however the flaw in this design is both contact locations can slide up to be adjustable for different width contact locations for different type batteries.  The adjustment mechanism is super weak and won't hold a location.  If you know anything about lithium ion batteries, you know how dangerous they can be to start fires.  If they are shorted, look out, a fire can break out.  I don't feel comfortable with these wobbly adjustable contacts, potentially moving around inadvertently and possibly shorting the battery somehow.  Since they won't hold a specific contact location, I had to JB WELD them into place for my model battery. And to do that I had to confirm the contact assignments on my battery since it had 4 contacts.  Although they were marked, only two our of four contacts were marked.  I confirmed three of the four contacts are used, having one ground, two positives and one no-connect.  Since my charger has only two contacts, I assume that making contact with only one of the 2 positive contacts will work OK.  I'm going to watch it closely while charging for the first few times.  I think the JB WELD epoxy will fix the adjustment flaw in this charger, turning it into a fixed contact width charger for my battery.  I highly recommend you buy a different charger made specifically for your battery, in my case a Galaxy S5 battery.  You'll be much happier not worrying about if the contacts are making proper contact.  Another issue with the S5 battery is the mechanical shape, it's somewhat long.  Since the battery fits in charger sideways it sticks way out to the side of the charger.  It can't be used in certain sockets I'm use to using to charge my phone, however for most this might not be the case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HEARSQ8" id="B00HEARSQ8-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-30:</strong> Really simple product that works like a champ.

It is a slim profile and holds the phone securely.  The clip popped off the rear of the case about 10 seconds after I received the case.  I popped it back on, but it continued to come unattached from the case back.  The blade/pressure attachment method used was clearly just not enough to hold the clip to the case back.  After applying a bit of gorilla glue to where the clip attached to the case, all is well and I can actually use it now.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009OUJRO2" id="B009OUJRO2-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-01:</strong> I bought a case like this when I had had a BB Bold.

One for my new iPhone 4S and the other one for my son's 4S. He is away at school so at first I was not concerned about confusing my phone with his. However the first time he came to visit it did turn out to be a problem. So I decided to get myself a case of a different color. I liked this black Slash - it felt snug and non-slippery in my hand and it provided like 1/32 of an inch protection edge for the screen (as when you put the phone down with the screen down the glass will not actually touch the surface of the table as it sits on the edge protruding around the perimeter of the phone). They did not not have a SLASH case in a color acceptable to me, so I went with this silver oneCaseCrown Metallic Glider Case for Apple iPhone 4 and 4S (AT&T;, Sprint, & Verizon compatible) - Silver. It is also a nice case. Also easy to put on and also provides protection for the screen - not as much though - may be 1/64 vs. 1/32 in the Slash model. However the silver case is not non-slippery - it is really smooth - not unlike the iPhone 4S without the case. I don't think it is going to be a huge problem, but it is not as easy to securely handle the phone while taking it out of the front pocket of my jeans. The way it feels in my hands is different. Very smooth. But not as secure. I guess as far as how it feels against my palm - I like the smooth feel better. However if they had a SLASH in a manly color other than black, I would have preferred to stay with the non-slippery SLASH model.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007P1RTOC" id="B007P1RTOC-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-25:</strong> I've had the iPhone 4 for a year and a half, and had cases of all types - the big honkin' Otterbox and $2 crap I found elsewhere.

I started out with an iFrogz case that lasted a few months but eventually the plastic near the screen and the volume buttons snapped off. I will say that I dropped the phone a few times however that's the reason I bought a case. I knew that would happen on occasions. I also had an Otterbox Defender case which kept my phone protected pretty well up until the time I dropped it on some concrete which caused one of the internal mics to break. Luckily I got the phone replaced for free at the Apple store. Another case I owned was manufactured by Splash. It was almost identical to the CaseCrown one I'm reviewing. I loved the case as it was simple and provided more than adequate protection for my phone. I had some issues with the rubber wearing off and after contacting their CS and not receiving a response for a replacement (even after I had previously submitted a positive review online) I ditched it. I tried another CaseCrown case. A red one that snapped down the middle of the phone, top to bottom. It worked well but eventually the plastic near the top snapped. Eventually I bought the CaseCrown Splash Glider Case. I've had it for some time now and can't speak highly enough about it. The case fits the phone snug. The joint between the top of the case and the bottom that snaps together seems well connected. This has been tested with accidental drops. The case exterior isn't wearing off like I experienced with the other cases. The biggest test is dropping the phone by accident on multiple occasions (a few times on concrete) and the phone taking no damage due to the protection of the case. Overall a great product especially for the price. It's simple which appeals to my tastes also. The case adds a little depth to the phone but not enough to make it really any tougher to store it in your pocket.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007P1RTOC" id="B007P1RTOC-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-12-27:</strong> have been using this case on my ATT iphone 4s for a week now and it's perfect. it's thin and not too big, but still feels very solid, and offers good protection. the case feels very nice in your hands and doesn't feel like it's going to slip out. have no problems taking my phone out of my pocket.the only slight issue i have with this case is the amount of fingerprints it attracts. i used to use the incipio ngp black matte, which didn't attract many fingerprints at all.however, this isn't a deal breaker for me. it functions great as a case for my iphone.5 stars.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007P1RTOC" id="B007P1RTOC-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-30:</strong> This is a AWESOME case!

I tried putting the case on with the screen protector I already had installed, the top half didn't bubble, but when I put on the second piece it bubbled all over the bottom.  I tried the same with the screen protector that came with the case, but it did the same.  It's not a big deal as it comes with a lay on the table design.  The ports are all easily accessible and non of the buttons are hard to reach.

I impulsively bought a gel case almost identical to this one (except in purple, the only color in stock) at Best Buy. I had wanted a case immediately and it did the job, but I got tired of the girly purple. So I gave this case a try. This case was literally one fourth the price of the one from Best Buy, yet the difference in quality between the name brand and this likely "knock off" is negligible. Both appear to be made of the same smooth, rubber-like material; both are about the same thickness; both fit the phone snugly. There is one place, on the front top (earpiece) area, where the expensive case was slightly more customized to the opening. However, on the reverse side, the holes for the camera lens and flash were incredibly precise on this case, whereas they weren't on the much more expensive case from Best Buy. In terms of looks, this case is more professional and mature looking...it is a smoky clear case with subtle circle patterns. The phone color and logo show through, but there is some tint. As far as I can tell, it offers the same basic level of protection as the rubber skin case I replaced. Bottom line: At less than $5, it is a great deal.

In particular it feels a little thicker.  It changes the feel of the phone in your hand obviously, from a smooth shell to a rubbery finish.  I am happy with that because it means non-slip.I didn't know what to make of the color description when I ordered it, but basically it is transparent, tinted dark grey with little circle designs.  It isn't loud, which is the only real criteria I have.Doesn't seem to interfere with GPS performance, which is a concern I have seen voiced with respect to cases.The buttons work OK despite being covered.  There are extra padded sections that cover the button and put pressure in the right place when you press down on them.Finally, I can report that it serves one major purpose of a rubberized style case like this - I have dropped the phone a few times with no noticeable dings or performance issues as a result.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004HFOMVW" id="B004HFOMVW-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-06-09:</strong> Pros: Inexpensive. Well made. Looks great! Unisex color. Fits perfectly on my HTC Inspire 4G, but is not too hard to take off like some TPU cases are. Did not push up on the screen protector like some other cases will. Full access to screen and you can still press the buttons. It makes the phone feel great in the hand.Cons: Only one. It seems to interfere with stereo bluetooth a bit. I get more skipping now than when the phone was naked. I have other TPU cases, similar result. This was using the Motorola S9-HD and S10-HD, I can't comment on other sets. I saw a review where someone says their TPU case interferes with wifi on the Inspire. Not in my case, just the stereo bluetooth function.The case still gets 5 stars because many people don't use stereo bluetooth but regular wired headphones, so this isn't an issue for them.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B004HFOMVW', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B004HFOMVW', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00AB7FVCY</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00AB7FVCY</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AB7FVCY" id="B00AB7FVCY-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-24:</strong> I have moved up screen size every year since my G1, to the Nexus One to the Droid to the Galaxy Nexus and now gloriously to the Note 2.

I think I have maybe pinched to zoom only 3-4 times since I've had it, tell me another phone that you can say that about.I don't have a lot to say that other reviews don't already say, but the biggest thing to note is that the battery life is phenomenal.

I love how zippy it is (coming from a Droid Razr Maxx) and the battery life is almost on par with the Razr Maxx too. I love the screen size, S-pen, and the audio playback...it actually has some bass to it & it's loud.I am actually a little more impressed with Amazon Wireless customer service; I received a defective device 1st and contacting customer service was a breath of fresh air. They shipped me a replacement via one-day shipping after they received my defective one back. If I would have purchased through Verizon and this happened it would have been a long drawn out ordeal.I will no longer purchase devices straight from the carrier I will stick with Amazon. This is where I get all of my cases, accessories, and now my smartphones.The only thing I do not like about this phone is how plastic cheap it feels and how Verizon has limited the multiview apps (for now until the update is released) while Sprint has not.

It is fast with virtually no lag time. Easy set up, sleek and lightweight, and the added bonus of an onboard s pen storage make this a must have! It is a little bigger than the Spectrum, but has the same sleek clean line look but performance has it hands down for this product! I originally had looked to get the Samsung Galaxy lll, but after much research and preferences decided on this and I am glad I did! This will probably be very hard to top, and the price was just irresistible! I purchased this from Amazon, and got it for nearly a hundred dollars cheaper than Verizon, and had no problems follwing the directions! Follow the instructions, and you will have this phone up and running in record time! I do recommend you purchase your screen protector and case at the same time, however, as you will find it harder to clean your screen after a few days use. I did an alcohol wipe down, but still had a few dust specks, which make it difficult to achieve a smooth application! This phone has all the bells and whistles that any techie would enjoy, I am still having fun exploring! I highly recommend this for anyone, though, not just the high tech person! I use my phone for my work, too, so this was the best buy!

The screen is fantastically vibrant and sharp. I love the stylus (Draw Something is so much more fun with it), the software is great and the phone really hums along. My last phone was a Droid Incredible 2 which I really liked, but this phone is so much better. It's only drawback it that the screen is so big that some one handed operations are difficult (I have small hands, so your mileage may vary). That one drawback is minor compared to the awesomeness that the phone brings. I had nearly decided on getting the Droid DNA until my wife got this phone a few weeks before my upgrade. After using hers my mind was made up that I had to have one too. The call quality is absolutely fantastic too.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AB7FVCY" id="B00AB7FVCY-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-11:</strong> I really am loving this device.  More than I thought I would.  The screen is beautiful and big, fast, smooth, and bright.  Very little downside for me.PROS:--Bright Screen--Fringer Print coating - I haven't heard anybody talk about the coating on the screen, but it is one of my favorite feature!  It is like working on silk, and it doesn't pick up finger print even close to what my previous phones did.  REally has a luxury feel.--Battery life - HUGE factor for me.  I can get through a regular moderate use day, and still have 30-40% batter when I get home.  CRAZY GOOD!  This can even be improved with tighter control over the settings for sure.--Removable battery - AND if the giant 3100mAh batter isn't enough, you can swap it out!--Speed - FAST FAST FAST!--SD card slot - up to 64BG on top of the 16GB on board--Android 4.1 Jelly Bean - I think they have finally passed iOS with this version.  Super fast smooth, and TON of cool gesture features available.--LED light on the front is great for notification without having to turn on the phone--Home Button - At 1st I didn't like it, but with such a big phone, it is really handy to beable to wake it up with the home button, and not have to reach up the side--Design- much improved over the Note I - thinner, buttons are more reachable.  Very premium feel, even though it is all plastic.  I'm surprised how much I like it.--Camera - lots of cool features and effects, and it is SUPER FAST--Touch Wiz - lots that I'm not a huge fan of, but the lock screen widgets are great.  Otherwise, I switched to Nova Launcher, and LOVE IT!  This really sold the device for me.  Touch wiz isn't great, but not horrible either.  Nova Launcher erases most of the annoyance for me (including having to look at Verizon Bloat ware in the app drawer) - SO EASY TO CUSTOMIZE!--S-PEN - I almost forgot! Very easy to use, needs more apps, but the ones that work well are beautiful.  It writes almost better than a regular pen.--Phone - volume on the speaker and ear piece are fine.  Very load and clear.LOVE THIS PHONE!CONS--Touch Wiz - The settings are scattered all over, some in the settings, some in the individual apps. More centralized would be better.  customized notification bar is so-so.  Wish I could re-arrange the icons and shrink them.  Pure JellyBean is much better (ESPECIALLY on 4.2).--Size - NOT A CON for me!  I used my old iphone last night and it felt like a tiny little toy.  Almost unusable.  I love the giant screen, but if you have small hands it will probalby be too big.  I'm 6" with large hands, but it is easier to drop...--Very Slick - I had to get a case because it is so smooth and slippery.  Very easy to drop.  I found a decent bumper case that isn't too bulky, and adds enough grip to feel more comfortable.Anything else..... NOT REALLY!  Android apps aren't always the best available, but the level of customization is so huge, It is worth breaking out of the Apple and Microsoft walled gardens.  (Yes, I said Microsoft too! - just spend two years with WP7, and it is just as closed as apple...IMO)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AB7FVCY" id="B00AB7FVCY-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-08:</strong> got this phone as a gift for someone. it works really well, has great battery life, wonderful screen, very smooth operation.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AB7FVCY" id="B00AB7FVCY-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-12:</strong> The Note 2 is my second smartphone. My previous device was a Moto Droid X and I loved it. My life was changed when I got my Droid X - I had almost instant access to every bit of data that I could possibly need. I'm not a particularly organized person, and having a smartphone helped me keep up with a busy life.After nearly 2 years, the Droid X was showing its age. 512MB of RAM and a single core processor isn't much these days. I was stuck on Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) with no upgrade in sight. ICS based roms were available, but Motorola's decision to lock down the phone meant that functionality was missing from ICS roms. It was time to shop for a new phone.The Note 2 caught my eye immediately. The large screen was a huge draw. I have a tablet, but it was too big to carry on a daily basis. My Droid X had a 4.3" screen, but reading documents on it caused eyestrain. The 5.5" Note 2 screen was just big enough to be a decent e-reader but small enough to fit in my pocket. It also weighs almost the same as the Droid X.The battery was another big plus. The battery in this phone is gigantic by smartphone standards. 3100 mAh is nothing to scoff at, compared with the Droid X's 1540 mAh. Many users have reported full-day performance with the Note 2. With my Droid X, I learned quickly to have a charger at home, at work, in the car, and in my backpack. In my first couple of days with this device, I have been using it heavily and going to bed at the end of the day with 20% or so left on the battery. That's impressive.The construction feels solid. Not as solid as the metal body of the Droid X, but well put together. All of the buttons feel great, with no wiggle or soft actuation. For such a large device, it fits into my hand well. The finish is slightly slick, and I'm handling it with kid gloves until I can get a case on it.Internally, the phone is well laid out. When you pop off the back cover, the battery, SIM, and MicroSD are all immediately accessable. A plastic overlay covers and protects the other internal components. I particularly like that I can insert and remove the MicroSD card without taking out the battery - A big gripe of mine with the Droid X was that I had to remove the battery to do that.Software-wise, I'm impressed with both Jellybean and Samsung's Touchwiz. Jellybean brings a lot of small but important updates to Android, and Touchwiz is a functional and nice looking software suite. Contrast this with Motorola's Blur, which I never really liked. The S-pen is amazing. I've not used it for anything "serious" yet, but for drawing, taking notes, and navigating the UI, it's pretty slick. I'm still experimenting with the split window functionality, but that's a neat feature as well.Performance wise, the phone is a hotrod. Apps download and install in seconds. Launching apps is nearly instantaneous. Switching between running apps is seamless. When streaming bluetooth audio to my car, I used to get pauses and interruptions in the audio. Not any more. It just plays.The display is equally impressive. The colors are bright and text is sharp. There are 4 color "levels" that you can choose from, from oversaturated to muted. I'm still deciding which level I prefer.This phone won't change my life as much as my first Android phone. The Droid X was a huge shift for me. The Note 2 is all that and a bag of chips. The larger screen, longer battery life, and scorching performance just make a great thing into a fantastic thing.tl;dr Great phone!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AB7FVCY" id="B00AB7FVCY-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-12:</strong> Amazing phablet in every way: size, screen, speed, memory, performance etc..  Actually I truly think its the best phone in the world at the present time.  The only little issue I found after 2 months of use is the location of the power button, the massive size of the phone makes you want to hold it from the edges if you want to avoid holding it from the screen, holding the phone from the edges often causes the accidental pushing of the power/wake/sleep button, much rather it was placed on top like Motorola phones.  But folks that's the only negative thing i found.

I love the big screen.  I wanted to upgrade and have some books to read on Kindle now and then for my Amazon reviews. I really needed a bigger screen and did not want to get a Kindle just to read.  The reading part of the screen is about 2 3/4 by 4 1/2 -- much larger than my previous smart phone.  This phone is fairly simple to operate the basics on and you can go to Google and download the detailed manual for free.  It's a slim phone, probably about a half inch on the side and a little more than 6 inches by 3 1/4 on the outside.  Slides nicely into most ladies' purses.  If you are a belt-wearer, you probably want to get an Otterbox case for durability.  Besides all the nice apps and the ability to actually write on it with a stylus pen, the stylus pen slides right inside the phone for storage.BTW, for those on the edge of buying, you might get this model a little cheaper now, because I understand the Galaxy Note III is scheduled to come out in about a month or less.This is a fun phone :)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AB7FVCY" id="B00AB7FVCY-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-17:</strong> Everyone that sees my phone says, &#34;Wow that phone is huge!&#34;  Some with a negative connotation (iPhone users) and others wish they had this screen size.

Instead, I am going to list a few reasons why I love this phone, plus one big caveat. The caveat first: when I got my first smartphone - a Motorola Droid X - I was equally pleased at this point in the ownership cycle. At month 18 that phone became a nightmare. So, factor that in as I gush about how great this phone is.My comparisons are going to be to the Droid X:- I cannot believe the battery life! I am no longer tethered to a charger. One three hour phone conversation dropped my battery to 73 percent. And it charged back up to 100% when I did plug it into a charger in less than 20 minutes. Note: this is a relatively new phone with a new battery. I doubt I would get the same results a year from now when the battery is worn by numerous charging cycles. Still, since I routinely go the entire day without charging it, only putting it on charge when I go to bed, the wear and deterioration of the battery will probably be far less than for other phones.- Boot-up time is amazingly quick. My previous phone took what seemed to be forever to come up in a ready state after restarting it or powering it back on. This one does it in literally seconds.- Signal strength is as good, if not better, than the phone it replaced. That was a relief because I had heard horror stories about this and the S III. In fact, the Motorola phone was legendary for it's antenna and receiving/transmitting systems and this phone is certainly its equal.- Speaker volume and reception are vastly superior to the Motorola.I transferred my SD card directly from my Droid X to this phone and all of its contents were immediately recognized by the Note 2. I did have to recreate my play lists for my music, which may have been stored in the internal memory of the Droid X. Still, that was a relief to not have to recreate everything.Although this phone is supposed to be locked down I have added apps to it with no problems, so for me that aspect is not an issue.One accessory that I found to be essential to protect the phone is anEvecase Leather Wallet Case with Stand and Credit Card Holder for Samsung Galaxy Note 2 II N7100 - Black.As for the size - it is not a problem for me. In fact, I an getting older and the larger form factor - while not cool or trendy - suits me perfectly.The phone is, if anything, too responsive. The screen is sensitive to your every touch. Sometimes my finger lands or overlaps areas adjacent to where I wanted to touch and the phone responds before I can correct it. That is a minor issue and many folks will probably not experience it.Since this phone is practically a tablet I purchased anHDE Silver Wireless Bluetooth 3.0 Keyboard, which makes it super-easy to use for web surfing and creating and developing documents with Polaris Office 4.0 that shipped with my phone.If there is anything to complain about it's Verizon itself. I had to change from my unlimited data plan to their far more restrictive one in order to upgrade. I am not pleased about that and consider it to border on unethical. I've been with Verizon since 1999 and have been very loyal - until now. And since this reviews is about Verizon's version of this phone I think my comment about this is valid.On the iPhone vs. Galaxy comparisons: I have friends who have iPhones and they have admired my Note 2, but are not about to switch. I can see their point. They are comfortable with that device's interface and features and have no compelling reason to switch. I mention this because that comparison seems to frequently crop up and it truly has no relevance in my opinion. Most folks who are used to Apple are probably going to stay with that platform, and the newer ones seem to have close to the same features judging from one of my friend's 4S model.As I mentioned above, time will tell about this phone. Right now I am thoroughly pleased with mine, but who knows? Latent flaws could surface in the future that change my opinion. If so I will come back and update this review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AB7FVCY" id="B00AB7FVCY-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-01:</strong> I am still in the discovery mode of all of what the Note II offers - by far this is the best smart phone that I have owned.

It's thin, lightweight, and build is of superb quality, it's sleek and will greatly compliment your iPhone 5.It can provide 1-1.5 full charge cycle to an iPhone 5. Easy to charge as it utilizes the micro USB port (input). I also love the battery meter where you can monitor progress in charging and juice left.The package came with several cables and adapters but not a lightning charging cable. I use my Kindle charging cable to charge this device. But the cables and adapters that came with it are made of quality materials and would definitely get you started on utilizing this external battery.Anker needs to replace the flashlight button as it can unknowingly be turned on, thus draining the battery. Had two unpleasant experiences with this in the past, hoping Anker can device a lock for the flashlight switch or fashion a different kind of switch that isn't the push button type.I highly recommend this external battery for everyday commute. I own two of these and I always keep one on both of my bags.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0054VNHSW" id="B0054VNHSW-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-18:</strong> I was really excited when I received my Anker portable charger, as I had done some extensive research on chargers and felt Anker best fit the bill. I keep multiple chargers and cords with me at all times and thought it was time to invest in something that combined all my charging needs into one compact unit.I'm sad to say Anker hasn't quite convinced me this was the product I needed. I felt sure that it would live up to its promise and charge my devices multiple times. I still feel this is a solid product, but am sorely disappointed in the fact that it only charges my Samsung Galaxy S II once fully. I fail to understand how a 3200mAh capacity can only fill a battery once.On a positive note, I feel the device's portability and  built in connectors still make it a great priduct for people on the go. You can't beat the price and Anker is still a quality brand. Before purchasing this charger, I would suggest you take a look at your charging needs from day to day and assess if you can prioritize the charging of this product in addition to your mobile devices.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0054VNHSW" id="B0054VNHSW-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-31:</strong> Only reason I would have considered giving it a four is that I wanted it to last longer!! It just died this month after 2 years 3 months. I was bummed but grateful it lasted that long. I don't know how long it was warrantied for but I doubt it was for that long. It was wonderful and handy having its own tiny curly cord (I never had to worry about searching out a cord to use or kick myself cuz I left it home when I needed it out and about.. I used to rubber band it to my phone so I could continue to use it while it was charging which worked out...OK funky, but hey any port in a storm right? Maybe this company can figure out some cheapie little half see thru?? case  or strap that would adapt to the Motorola phone series as well as the smaller iphones so they can be kept together better while charging.

It's light and thin - about the size of a 4&#34; cellphone, but the best part is the built-in microSD connector.  I find it to be sturdier and better quality overall than I had expected.  The whole device is elegant; like an Apple product.  What I like is that the cable is springy and stays taut - no dangling wire here.  you plug it in and then just &#34;fold&#34; the device behind your phone, sort of like an extended battery pack. It seems to charge my phone pretty quickly, too.  I don't think it'll give me days worth of charge, but it gives me plenty enough to make it through the odd day when I run out of juice, no matter how much I use my phone.

First, it looked fairly compact, although smaller devices in different shapes do exist. The price was fair, and I liked that it had a built in flashlight, because nothing says VALUE like MULTITASKING. :) I also like how the mini-USB attachment is built in, many other devices require that you carry a separate cord to use it. If you only need a mini-USB connection, then no extra cords are required. It also has a female mini-USB and regular USB connection at the top so you can also use this to charge other devices (like an older ipod/iphone connection, for example).The device is about the same size as my ipod classic and is very light. I liked that it came in white or black. Out of the box, it was nearly fully charged (the readings go in increments 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%). I hooked it up to charge it to capacity and it has a nice light feature to tell you when it's fully charged. The lights blink as it's charging, when it's done, the lights go solid. Very helpful. Took about 5 minutes to be fully charged.I've only had it a few days, but I've used it to charge my phone up from 50% capacity about 3 times and it's still showing 75% power. My phone seems to charge slowly, but it is slow to charge regardless if it's hooked up to the laptop or directly into the wall, so I'm not faulting this device for that issue.I'm taking off one star because it comes with a &#34;power cord&#34; that doesn't work on this device. The instructions show you that it's supposed to come with a cord that has a USB connection on one end and a mini-USB connection on the other. This cord has a regular USB port on one side and a circular port on the other. The circular connector doesn't fit on this device at all. It doesn't look like any connector I've ever seen, so I don't think I have any use for it at all. It seems like this might have been a mistake since the illustration shows a different (and useful) cord. It's not enough of an issue for me to return this item since I have several USB/mini-USB cords lying around, but it would be incredibly inconvenient if you're expecting a cord to use this with. Other than that, I'm satisfied that I got a good product at a good value.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0054VNHSW" id="B0054VNHSW-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-30:</strong> The package and the battery are designed in an almost Applesque manner. The battery is sleek looking and almost feels like an iphone4 (just a little thicker and shorter width and length). The built-in micro usb connector is handy however the cable length is so short that your phone will be practically stuck to the battery.

The unit is small and light and the cable fits snugly into the side when not in use. Much cheaper than a replacement battery and charger it is ideal for us, especially as it is so neat.The battery charges a phone from flat in about 2 hours but you can still use it whilst you are charging.  We have used it to charge my Samsung Flash phone and my son's iPhone (you do need the iPhone lead though). It can even part charge and iPad so it has very quickly become invaluable to us.I use Anker batteries in my phone and they are very good so I had no worries about the quality or the durability of this device.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0054VNHSW" id="B0054VNHSW-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-07-05:</strong> This was my first portable phone charger to buy, and so far im impressed with this product.

This external battery is a great resource, though one charge of the battery is enough to charge the phone fully only one time. The built-in microUSB means that you don't have to carry a charging cable - just throw the external battery into your bag or pocket and out you go.The one qualm is that the flashlight is a little too easy to turn on, so sometimes things in the bag will turn the light on and I won't realize which can be a useless drain of the battery.

It eats battery, even without having mobile data turned on.  This little baby gives me a way to make the Nexus even more valuable.  AND, it has an LED flashlight. Some people might say, meh.  But I use one quite often and now I don't have to go looking for it. So, two very convenient uses.  It has a hollowed out corner in case a person might like to use it as a key fob, but my keys are too thick for the most part.  One negative is that it doesn't come with an AC charger.  The plus is it will use any AC micro USB charger.  The ones from my Samsung dumb phone and my Nexus smart phone both fit.  I'm pretty sure you could carry this around in your pocket for at least a year before causing and visible damage to the case. And it's so light, I doubt you'll notice it after a few minutes the first time. I really like the extending cable that allows you to charge almost anything with a Micro USB port.

I am very happy with the Anker overall, but a few quirks :  it would have been nice to have cord to recharge device also included (what's with the weird dongle too???) and a small info/user manual would be nice since it's not clear how to recharge (use included cord with adapter in round plug), using flashlight (hold button), or how to know when fully recharged (can't recall, but I think it stops blinking or display goes off).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0054VNHSW" id="B0054VNHSW-review30" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-07-19:</strong> I bought this product for backup for my cell phone I'm constantly using it all the time and am always killing it.

It has a light up power indicator that tells you it's charge in 25% increments that glows in a nice blue.  Also as a nice bonus it can be used as a LED flashlight.  It won't light up a forest but will perfect to get your keys in the door.When looking for a battery battery backup I wanted something that would at least double my smartphones (Galaxy Nexus) battery life and this does it no problem.  Probably closer to a charge and a half or so.Not only is it functional it is actually smaller than I expected. I never mesured it but was suprised when it came and was smaller ad thinner than my phone and is easily pocketable.  I also like that it has the micro-usb input built-in so I don't have to carry another cable around for my android products.  It works with Apple and others but you have to carry your sync cable around.I can charge the product from my computer or the usb adapter that comes with my phone which is nice.  But that is also maybe it's only downfall if you don't have a product laying around that can charge it via usb.  It has an adapter so you could probably buy a power adapter for it separatly.For the money I didn't expect what I got.

The 2600mA (milliamp)battery is solidly constructed, and while slim and easily slipped into pant's/jean pocket, has a weighty-substantive feel. It has a piano-finish, high gloss shell (really nice). The charger boasts a MICRO port for charging ease, and comes (this is best part)with a micro-tip charger nestled smartly in the side of devices, attached to 2-3 inch coiled wire. Just long enough to get your charge on.This charger will give my Motorola RAZR phone an almost complete re-charging. By the time it's done this, your charger is dead. But, not bad, mission accomplished. For those interested in better understanding: My RAZR phone has a 2600 mA battery. So Charger at 2600mA, phone holds 2600mA. Being so happy with the Anker product, I passed on buying thier 5600mA product (the 5600 would nicely recharge your phone TWICE with little trouble) and went for the insurance of the "[Upgraded Version] Anker Astro2 Dual USB Output 8400mAh Backup External Battery Pack Charger with built-in Flashlight", also purchased on Amazon. This puppy should allow me to charge my smart phone several times a day with plenty of back-up for another day, perhaps more. I'll never run out...smile. Your tablet/Android/iOS/ should be a cinch for the 8400mA device as well.The 8400mA is slim as well, a bit thicker, not by much, still fine in trouser/jeans pocket, so no worry there. Anker has sent E-mail after each purchase asking for feedback and general thoughts. They seem genuinely concerned with the reputation they hold in the marketplace. Always a good sign.Highly recommended!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0054VNHSW" id="B0054VNHSW-review37" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-09:</strong> I've got it's big brother for myself, and this is what my wife carries to recharge both her iPhone 4, and her older more basic cell phone.

Loaded up my bluetooth radio on my car, cranked up the radio using spotify all the while using the navigation app.  5 hours later, phone (samsung s3) was still at 70% charge and my external battery had used up all its energy, that's what i call awesome.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0054VNHSW" id="B0054VNHSW-review39" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-07-01:</strong> In this generation, we are lost without our cellular devices. We use it for work, for communication, for entertainment etc. With all these wonderful features in our phones, we tend to become reliant on them. However, everyday we all tend to experience mini heart attacks because we are always faced with situations where we need our phone for an important task but battery is close to being over. Let's face it, smartphones have very poor battery life.Thankfully there are cheap and great alternatives and this happens to be one of them.Let's get to the product. This works with almost every phone. It has a built in plug which you can just connect to your phone and it will start charging right away. For iPhone users however, you need to connect your usb and then charge, which isn't a big deal. The product has indicators on it letting the user know how much battery life is left using led display, which is very helpful. You can connect this to your phone and while it is charging, you can keep your phone on use and it will supply the power. One great little feature this product has is a built-in flashlight. Now your thinking, what do I need a flashlight for? trust me I thought the same thing and that little gadget actually came in handy in my everyday life while I was out. Its a nice little addition we can all enjoy. The size of the product is about the size of a credit card and it is very slim. It is very light in weight and sometimes you might forget your even carrying it in your pocket.The only bad thing about this product is that it is not 3200mAh. I have a Samsung Galaxy S2 and a 3200mAh battery should give me atleast 2 full charges, however this external charger only gives me about 1 full charge. Overall for the price, this is a very solid product and saved me many times. If your tired of waking up in the morning and realizing you forgot to charge your phone, well this is your solution. Wherever you are or whenever it is, your phone's battery life will now be one less headache to worry about.Additional information - The customer service for Laptopmate is amazing. I chose standard shipping for my item but they sent it to me using priority mail so I was able to receive it faster. Little things like that can give you assurance that your purchase is appreciated.Anker also provides this product with a 18 month warranty and instructions on how to report complaints or problems with your device or service. The Anker family wants nothing short of 100% customer service and they are doing a wonderful job providing great quality that is hard to find these days. Go with this product, you will have nothing to worry about.I hope I helped! if you have any questions let me know and I will answer as soon as possible. Thank you so much for reading my review!Edited*As of 11/7/2012 this product is still providing me with wonderful service, I have used it almost everyday for the past four months and I have not experienced anything negative so far. My review still stands, this is a wonderful product.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0054VNHSW" id="B0054VNHSW-review40" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-07:</strong> I bought this battery with the intention of charging my Galaxy S3, now of course the Galaxy S3 is a power-hungry phone with its large screen and it has a large battery so this thing won't be able to charge it too many times but it'll charge it back with another charge and then some - enough to make it last a day of pretty heavy use.The battery has a nice finish to it and feels good in the hand, doesn't feel heavy its like another phone.. but not quite and it feels solid, no signs of creaking to be found - just great build quality it looks great AND feels great; a plus is that it comes in white - for those people that have white handsets it matches perfectly - in this case it matches my S3.All in all this is a pretty great external battery for its size and for light travel, but if you want something especially larger look elsewhere.My only gripe is that I wish it included a plug for outlet use so I could charge up my phone and battery at the same time when they're near an outlet.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0054VNHSW" id="B0054VNHSW-review41" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-28:</strong> This awesome device charges my ipod 2 full times, with still a little juice left in it. it does take about 4 hours for the Anker SlimTalk to charge, but its worth it. its good to take on trips, or at school and work, where you will be on the move constantly and never near an outlet. right out of the package it charged my ipod from 13% to 92%. for $22, this product is a must have for handheld tech users.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0054VNHSW" id="B0054VNHSW-review42" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-02:</strong> This Anker Slim battery pack is outstanding.  It is as it says, very slim and convenient.  It charges with a Micro USB cable which is included.  Charge time is pretty quick.  It also comes with a built in micro USB cord that will charge something with a micro USB slot, such as an Android Smartphone.  Most of the people buying this will charge their phones or tablets with this device, and it works great in that regard.  I've had many rechargeable battery packs.  The ones from Anker have always been excellent working and a value on top of that.It also includes a built in LED light which is bright enough for fishing around in the dark in your glove box or purse if you're a woman.  Handy. It also has a very simple battery gauge that shows power remaining in the pack in 25% increments.  All in all, this battery pack will serve your needs at a fine price and without bulk.  Perfect for recharging your cell or giving your tablet a bit more juice if you can't get to an outlet.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0054VNHSW" id="B0054VNHSW-review43" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-28:</strong> I hooked the back-up charger to my dead cell phone.  The back-up charger gave my cell life as described.  The low battery icon on my phone measured at 5%.  Although at 5% my phone worked as normal; meaning I did not get a pop-up warning saying "your battery is low", which normally happens when the battery is down to 5%.  Nor did my screen dim-out which is normal with very low battery.In my opinion the back-up charger works fine.  Its just that when in-use don't expect an accurate measure from your cell's battery widget.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0054VNHSW" id="B0054VNHSW-review44" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-10:</strong> I've been wanting this product for sooooo long. and im very happy that i finally brought it ..It works very well. :D it charges my my phone all the way. and i have an s3, and the s3 has a big battery. so if u want this get it . u will not regret it</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B0054VNHSW', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B0054VNHSW', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B0042LRARY</h2>    <p class="price"> $B0042LRARY</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0042LRARY" id="B0042LRARY-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-10-01:</strong> Bought this 4 months back for my HTC Inspire 4G.

With a silicone/rubber case, there is tremendous friction created when you put in/remove the phone out of the pouch. This might result in some early damages to your phone & pouch.Some of the reviews in Amazon mentions about a strong magnetic lock for this product which reportedly harms the phone. I haven't seen that problem in mine. The magnetic lock is strong enough to hold the phone but seems to do no damage beyond.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0042LRARY" id="B0042LRARY-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-03-29:</strong> Good case but my Galaxy Nexus will hardly fit, have to push to make it fit.

Don't always use the pouch but there are times when it is easier to carry the phone in it rather than a pocket.  The droid pro in the hard case fits very nicely.  There have been times when I thought the swivel would have been better than the belt loop but think you can buy it separate, however I'm learning to like the belt loop.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0042LRARY" id="B0042LRARY-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-24:</strong> Even though the Samsung Galaxy S2 i9100 International Version is such an exquisite phone naked; it, like any other high-end electronic device, is prone to being scratched or dropped. So after extensive "research" for practical phone-protected carry, here enters the Dickies Active Duty case.There aren't many case choices for the Galaxy S2 at present; or at least ones that I'd like to use (I'm a case snob). There's either a barely there-type cover which snaps on the back leaving the top, front and bottom exposed or a slip-in and then there's the fold-over flap design that leaves the corners and part of the top open to potential damage. Neither of these cases come with built-in belt clips so you're stuck carrying the phone in your pocket, purse, or whatever you use to transport your phone. Just not your belt. I didn't like neither of these options because of the conditions mentioned and I needed something to put the phone in to travel with it that would protect the screen. I like to keep my phone completely protected as much as possible and in my pocket instead of in my hand all the time and like to have it protected, but easily accessible wherever I went. I bought this Dickies and also the Trident AG-SGX2-BK AEGIS case with hopes the Trident would fit and fortunately it did even knowing that the Dickies case would be too large for the phone alone according to past Dickies reviews.As previous reviewers have pointed out and to my disappointment, the snap on the front flap IS purely there for aesthetic reasons and not as a reinforced fastener that a Maxpedition would provide. The magnet on the flap and case are also very weak which could be a good thing since I read somewhere that it could affect the functionality of the phone. But it's a bad thing too because the flap is just that, a flap and offers no security of holding the phone in the case unless it's in the upright position. The magnets just aren't strong enough to keep it closed so don't expect to use this case without an additional case or cover on any phone you put in there because it will definitely move around and more than likely fall out if the case is pushed to its side or placed upside down. This is why I had to deduct a star. The inside of the case is so spacious that two Samsung GS2's could probably fit which is why you would need an additional cover or case to take up the extra space. I took this into consideration and lucked out because the Trident fit so perfectly almost like it was made specifically for the Dickies. See the pictures I uploaded for yourself.The Trident sits snugly and since it has a silicone outer ring, the Dickies case hugs it with no slippage once the Trident is inside. This combination I have now gives me the face in protection the Otterbox Defender or Ballistic cases would have given me.On another note, this Dickies case doesn't come with a belt clip, but offers a Dickies brand clip as a separate accessory at an additional cost which is questionable because it should have been included. I was going to get it, but since their clip had bad reviews, I opted to buy a non-swiveling Krusell SpringClip (58301) and it fits and works flawless and is cheaper clip than Dickies clip.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0042LRARY" id="B0042LRARY-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-07-31:</strong> I liked this for quite a while. I needed one that didn't tilt. Did wish it had a clip (not loop). This does catch on chair arms - as many do - but it's tearing across the top of the loop. Maybe I'm just hard on them? Anyway, the "Rugged" of "Dikies RUGGED Pouch" isn't playing out. Looking at Maxpedition now, as their stuff is seemingly bulletproof.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0042LRARY" id="B0042LRARY-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-07-10:</strong> The quality of this pouch is overall pretty good.  There are three reasons, however, that I gave it two stars.  1) It is over three times as expensive as a similar-quality pouch made by Reiko (see my related review).  2) When used with a belt through the belt-loop with your shirt hanging over the pouch (rather than tucking your shirt in), you can feel the plastic multidapt clip adapter rubbing on your skin.  This problem would be eliminated, I'd imagine, if you bought the actual multidapt clip separately--but there goes even more money down the drain.  3) It claims to be a universal pouch for many phones including the Samsung Focus, but it does not fit it well at all.  The pouch is a little too short for the magnetic clasp to close all the way if your Focus has a case on it, and the pouch is a good half an inch too wide to hold the phone snugly.Obviously, if you have a different sized phone than the Samsung Focus (4.84 x 2.56 x 0.39 inches +case), problem #3 would not be applicable, but be wary of the first two issues.  Just to roughly estimate, I would think the pouch would be better suited for a phone that was closer to 4-4.5" tall, around 3" wide, and up to .5" thick (+case).Overall, while decently made, the quality is no better than other holsters I've owned for a fraction of the cost.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0042LRARY" id="B0042LRARY-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-10-26:</strong> I Love the vertical style and I love evenly the fact that it has a belt LOOP not clip. This ENSURES that this case is not going anywhere! I love the Strong Leather that it has, does not feel cheap at all and the fact that it fits my phone. (PERFECTLY) I would recommend this case to ANYone who has a EPIC, EVO, DROID X, ETC as this case is the perfect one for me!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0042LRARY" id="B0042LRARY-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-09-13:</strong> This is a perfect fit for the Samsung Droid Charge.  You will not be able to have a "glove" on the phone while it's in the case.  However otherwise this droid fits in like perfect, no shaking or pulling down the top.  And I've tried a number of pouches for this droid and none fit as well nor are made as well as this pouch.Magnet closure does NOT make the screen go on or off.  No effect on the phone.  And I like the magnet closure as you are sure it closes.In the pictures you are seeing the front of the pouch.  That is "snap" closure is nothing more than a decoration.I would of given this full stars, but I'm taking one away as there is no clip (or preferably a rotating clip) on it nor one that you can purchase.  The one that's recommended in the description is for a web type tool belt.  That clip will NOT work on a regular belt, your pants, shirt, etc.  IF you have a tool belt, you probably would be very happy with that clip.  Otherwise it will not work.The back is nothing more than (fastened on both ends with an opening in the middle) a secure area to run your belt or strap through.  I cannot think of a scenario where this pouch would fall off your belt or strap.  It's very secure.  Your belt would have to break or come off.  And it's very wide, I've never seen any mens belts that would not fit this.Or if you have a bag you want to keep your droid in so to not scratch the phone or such, this pouch is for you.I spoke with customer service for this company and they cannot find a clip that will work for this phone.  I'm very surprised that the designers of this did not include the option for a rotating clip.  I know some do not like clips, but I like 360 degree rotating clips.Now I THINK you can purchase a self glue on clip.  I've not seen any that rotate of this type.  However I'm reluctant to use it as once you put it on, it may or may not stick properly and could make a mess of the leather.If you are looking for a rugged pouch for a Samsung Droid Charge.  You need a belt or strap of some type you can put it on, by opening the belt/strap each time you want to remove the pouch. There is no way to open the back of the pouch as it's securely sewn on both sides.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B0042LRARY', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B0042LRARY', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B004XPLPUM</h2>    <p class="price"> $B004XPLPUM</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004XPLPUM" id="B004XPLPUM-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-08:</strong> the wire started to rip towards the connection within a few weeks but for the price im not complaing to much</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004XPLPUM" id="B004XPLPUM-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-06-03:</strong> Used this cable to charge iPhone 4, 4s, and iPad 1...there was an audible buzzing noise when plugged in and it generated so much heat it literally made my phone (and the outlet) hot to the touch.

Now I can have a charger not only at my bedside, but at my computer and in my car too.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B004XPLPUM', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B004XPLPUM', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00CIYCDOC</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00CIYCDOC</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CIYCDOC" id="B00CIYCDOC-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-15:</strong> Holds great to the Samsung galaxy note 2 and the Iphone 5 and DROID RAZR MAX.

It is painted white. The clips have foam and won't damage whatever you mount it to nor your phone. I mounted mine on my lamps pole. So the arm extends out horizontally. The clips have strong springs. The mounting spring is about 5-10 pounds of pressure to get them to open and about 3 pounds for the phone. This holds well. Both the arm and the suction cup are spherical gimbles to which the cell phone clip attaches to. So you can rotate and tilt in all sorts of ways. so the bummer part is that the package only comes with one phone clip. so you end up using either the arm or the suction not both.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CIYCDOC" id="B00CIYCDOC-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-08:</strong> Very well built! I was surprised at how stury this thing is! It could easily support the heaviest tablet if you had a way to connect it. The clip is large a holds my Galaxy phone very well.

I have a skin on my ipad mini and the padding in the quick release holder is so thick that I my mini has to be forced into the holder.  After that, it does hold very well.  The neck itself is very stiff and once I got my mini in the holder, it moved a bit while playing candy crush but not bad, didn't interfere with the game.  The vise type clamp that is on it works, but be careful if you move the goose neck, it will move with it and slip off or cause minor damage to whatever you have it clamped too.  all in all its pretty ok, but I sent mine back.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CIYCDOC" id="B00CIYCDOC-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-17:</strong> Fit my Dell Venue 8 Pro with a case on it no problems at all.The clamp and gooseneck fit are nice and solid, but the ball joint where the tablet holder connects to the neck is a little loose, but workable (I tightened that connection down as far as I can).

The blue LED lit ring around the USB port is a nice plus, and so is the safety cap for when you're not using the 12V socket. I think the unit is reasonably sized, not too big but not compact either.However, I have to deduct one star because, at least for me, it did not seem to stay firmly plugged in. I had to push it in a few times. My outlet is horizontal and perhaps the unit was a bit bulky for my small car and/or I accidentally did something to make loosen and break the connection. You may or may not have this issue depending on your configuration, so keep this in mind. Make sure you have the room for it and a socket placement that will make the weight of the unit (plus whatever is plugged into it) keep it firmly in the socket (if it sticks out horizontally then you may be more likely to have problems keeping it firmly connected in the socket).NOTE: I received a free product sample for review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EOYOF36" id="B00EOYOF36-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-25:</strong> I was provided with this USB car charger free of charge by Yubi Power in exchange for my honest review.There are probably hundreds of different USB car chargers on the market and I have tried several different brands and types. When comparing the quality of this USB car charger to other chargers I would consider this about average. What's nice about this one is that you don't lose the ability to use your cigarette lighter socket. This adapter plugs into the socket and then you can use the socket on this adapter along with the USB port to charge your electronic devices. I have been using it to charge by iPad and it has worked perfectly. I like the blue LED light on the front because it really comes in handy at night. The bright light doesn't bother me at night but it may bother some people. Overall this is a simple USB charger but it's low cost and gets the job done. No complaints from me.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EOYOF36" id="B00EOYOF36-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-23:</strong> I use a lot of gadgets in the car, but the lack of charging outlets usually prevents me from using more than a couple at the time. This charge splitter is a great answer to those dilemmas: it allows me to connect a USB-charging device while leaving the cigarette lighter socket available for another use. Granted, most modern devices today use USB charging to begin with, so a dual USB charger for the cigarette socket would more or less serve the same purpose in those cases. However, there are enough legacy devices out there that will only work when directly plugged in the cigarette lighter, that this charger really comes in handy.The charger is reasonably well built. It plugs in securely into the lighter socket. The small blue LED light around the USB plug can be handy at night, but it can also be a detraction - those small lights are VERY bright for their size.I have tested this charger while simultaneously using an iPhone and a radar detector. It performed as advertised with both units. I am pretty happy with its function and would recommend it to anyone looking for a similar charger.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EOYOF36" id="B00EOYOF36-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-18:</strong> I was provided a Yubi Power USB Car Charger with 12V Cigarette Lighter Socket for testing and review and was asked only to give my honest review, so this is what I found.What You Should Know Before You Buy:&#9830; This thing is a little bulky, but that is to be expected for what it does.&#9830; It is a cigarette lighter extension that adds a basic phone charger with a single 1.0 Amp USB charging port.&#9830; It charges very fast (better than 1% charge increase per minute on an iPhone 5).&#9830; The charger is front heavy.  I had a problem maintaining a connection in the horizontal charging outlets in my car.Detailed Review:&#9830; Look - The product came in a professional looking plastic hanger display package with the car charger displayed in the front and product information on both sides of the inside card. It also had some basic instructions on the back of the card (not that you really need them). This is a larger car charger, but that is to be expected because you are basically extending the cigarette lighter and adding a USB charging port. It has a single 1.0A USB port and a blue LED power indicator light on the front.  It appears to have a very nice build quality.&#9830; Installation - As with any car charger, you basically just plug the unit into you car's charging outlet. Once plugged into a horizontal outlet on my dash (where the charger sticks straight out), I noticed that it would not maintain connection to the charging outlet.  It kept coming out enough to stop the charging.  I'm not sure if it was due to my car or the fact that it was front heavy due to the larger size.  I haven't had any problems with other, smaller car chargers.  I moved it to my center console where I have a vertical charging outlet (where the charger stands straight up), and it worked perfectly.&#9830; Use and Performance - Once installed, I did some basic tests to see how the Yubi Power car charger handles charging up my iPhone 5, while at the same time running the dual screen DVD player in my back seat. During my work commute, I took my iPhone 5 that had 29% charge remaining and I plugged it in. The charger increased the charge on my phone by 31% in about 29 minutes or slightly more than 1% per minute, which is a great result and faster than your average charger.  All this while running both DVD player screens at the same time.  No reduction in charging speed at all.  It worked perfectly and as well as any other higher priced USB chargers that I have used with the added bonus of still having your car's charging outlet available.Conclusion:Overall, this is a good, dual purpose USB Car Charger with a solid build. The unit looks good and performs very well. While you may not be able to use it in horizontal car charging outlets very easy, it works perfectly for vertical applications at a very low price ($8 at the time of this review). If you need to keep your car's charging outlet available, but also want a fast USB charger for your phone, this charger is worth a look.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EOYOF36" id="B00EOYOF36-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-24:</strong> If you need to retain your cigarette lighter socket while adding a USB port, this is a simple solution that works extremely well. I tested by charging an Android Galaxy S3 while using a DVD player and it charged just as fast (if not slightly faster) than my existing USB converter. It's a solid unit that's great for the back of the car especially if you have passengers with multiple electronic devices. It's larger than just the USB converter as you would expect and at this price is excellent value for the simple but important task it performs.Disclosure: I received a review sample of this product.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EOYOF36" id="B00EOYOF36-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-25:</strong> This Yubi Power USB car charger is a cigarette lighter adapter that lets you use the 12V socket along with a USB port. It works well and charges devices quickly, the only drawback is that it's a bit on the long/bulky side so it sticks out more than I'd like - though it's hard to see how the 12V socket extension could be made smaller. It has a cover for the lighter port which protects it from dust and accidental contact with anything while it's not being used. It seems solidly built and it has a blue LED light active when connected properly. This item is great if you need to connect a 12V DC device and a USB device at the same time.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EOYOF36" id="B00EOYOF36-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-11:</strong> I ended up not needing this but I will keep it just in case.

It took some effort to get it on trying to stretch the last corner of the case on my iPhone 5, but once I got it on it fit like a glove.  The cut outs lined up perfectly and the volume raised buttons hit the iPhones buttons without a glitch.  The soft rubber sides made a good contact with the inside of my hand, so no need to worry if it will slide out. However, the back of the case is made out of a thinner hard plastic which has a slipperier finish.  This is a hard and soft case - the sides are soft rubber, but the back is made of a hardened plastic, I guess that is where the term Hybird comes in.I was sent this case for free directly from the manufacturer to try out, and in return all they asked for was an honest review.  I am happy to say I am pleased with the amCase Hybird Bumper Case.

The bumper looks and feels great in person.  I'm not worried about damaging the phone at all taking the case on and off.The phone feels thin with the case on.  I can't tell if the case is on or off with the phone in my pocket.  This is going to be a plus for a lot of people, but realize I want something more bulky now.  I am clumsy and dropped my last phone a lot, and I think it would feel better on my shoulder when talking with the phone.I spent a lot of time researching Nexus 5 cases.  It was tough for me to pick out a Nexus 5 case at this point in time because so many have little quirks here and there, and it's so hard to buy something without seeing it in person first.  At the price point the case is a great value, and you won't be kicking yourself if you happen to not like it in person.

Highly recommend.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009MZHGZ6" id="B009MZHGZ6-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-12:</strong> First off, the fitment is PERFECT. Slips on very securely, no loose areas, and cut-outs are right on and good-sized. I would have paid $25 for this case and still been happy with my purchase.Protection: If you're the type who *needs* an otterbox, the stop reading and buy one of those. However, if you're looking for the BEST protection you can get in a slim, attractive case, this is it!  This case (like most TPU cases) adds a nice lip around the screen to protect the edges from impacts, and allow you to place the phone face-down without anything touching the screen.Appearance: The combination of hard-plastic transparent back and gloss TPU bumper works well for my white Nexus 5. The two halves are mated perfectly, no glue or rough edges. Only minor negative is the amCase logo printed on the back.I also used the Anker 3-pack screen protectors, which are a static-cling style, and the case didn't interfere with it at all.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009MZHGZ6" id="B009MZHGZ6-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-12:</strong> This case is definitely a good by for the money.

It does a great job protecting the phone from impact. There are cutouts for the camera/flash, heart rate sensor, and speaker.The side of the case is made of TPU, and feels like a stiff silicone rubber mix. There are cutouts for the headphone jack, charging port, and IR blaster. Also, there are button overlays for the volume and power buttons. The sides take on the role of a bumper and helps stop dents and dings.In the hand, the case is very light and does not add any noticeable weight. Once on the phone, the case has a nice tight fit and protects the phone quite nicely. There is also a small raised edge on the front of the case so your phone can be placed faced down without scratching your screen.If you are looking for a case to protect your phone, give these a try. The best part is that it can't be beat for the price.CONTENTS:amCase Hybrid Bumper CaseFEATURES:Case Back Material: PolycarbonateCase Side Material: TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane)Warranty: 1 YearGuarantee: 30-Day Money BackI was supplied a sample for the purpose of review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009MZHGZ6" id="B009MZHGZ6-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-21:</strong> I just got my amCASE hybrid case and I'm quite pleased with it!  First time buying an amCASE case but definitely won't be my last time.PackagingOne thing I like to see with packaging is when its kept to a minimum.  It's more eco-friendly and it keeps cost down for the manufacturer and consumer.  We don't need a flashy package do we?  They spend the money were it belongs, on the product!Build Quality/DesignThe build quality seems to be high.  No rough corners, sharp edges or defects.  All lines are clean and well made.  It does have a white "amCASE" logo on the back that doesn't seem to quite fit with everything else  but it's not too noticeable or distracting.  They went with a two tone two material hybrid design.  The back is a harder frosted plastic while the sides are a glossy tpu rubber material.  It transitions from on material to the other seemlessly.The frosted back is transparent but gives a smoked/blurry effect when looking through it.  Which I kinda like; sort of artsy don't you say?All cutouts seem to be perfectly aligned.  No ports are covered.  I like how they went with a big cutout for the micro usb port so we can use any micro usb cable to charge our phones.  Also the cutout for the headphone jack is decently big.  Would like it to be a tad bigger so ANY headphone plug can be used but it looks like most if not all plugs would be okay with this case.  I hate it when a cases headphone cutout is too small to use with your headphones but that wasn't the case with this one.The "buttons" on the case to simulate where the actually buttons are of not the best quality but definitely not the worst I've seen on tpu cases.  Finding the buttons in pocket wasn't a problem as it has a good feel to them.  Pressing them was good also.  I never felt like I had to exert too much effort to get the button press to register with the phone.It's also worth mentioning that the edges are raised to prevent scratching the phone when placing it face down on a table.It's not the slimmest nor the bulkiest but a good compromise between the two.  It won't protect your phone from a drop 2 stories up but it will provide good protection all the way around your phone for those minor drops we all have.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009MZHGZ6" id="B009MZHGZ6-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-27:</strong> Very happy with it, if I have any complaints the fitbit on the top and bottom aren't perfect but for $.99 it is easily overlooked.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009MZHGZ6" id="B009MZHGZ6-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-08:</strong> If you're looking for protection at a great value than this case is for you.

The sides are made of stiff plastic that provides good protection from small drops. There is also a raised lip for lapying the phone on a flat surface. The back is a clear matte finish which is just clear enough to see the NEXUS logo on the back. Overall, for the price this is a great case that I will keep using. My few issues with the device are that the buttons are stiff so they require a little more force to press than I would hope. Also, while the micro USB port is larger than some cases I have used, I do still have issues with some cables (not the official) that have large micro USB connectors. The cables will fit in and charge the device, but if are moved or pulled even the slightest will stop charging. Again, the stock connector works fine, but some brands of cables (like Amazon Basic) have larger connectors.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009MZHGZ6" id="B009MZHGZ6-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-30:</strong> I like the way it looks but the volume buttons or a little hard to push down plus the power button is hard also.

It's smooth and fits the curves of the Nexus 5, unlike many other cases from Spigen. It's also very thin, but seems like it would provide good protection in an event of a drop. It's got a great balance between grippy and smooth, allowing you adequate grip while holding it, and slippery enough to pull out of your pocket with ease. Overall, It's a great value.There is one large issue I have with this case that's preventing me from using it. I have a glass screen protector from Spigen on my Nexus 5 and this case pushes on it and lifts it. If I did not have a screen protector on my phone, I would be using this one over the 4 other cases I've tried (Spigen Ultra hybrid, Neo Hybrid, Slim Armor, Ballistic. My brother has the N5 also, so we got a lot of cases between the two of us.)Another issue which is less important is that the case has a logo on the back in white that says amCase, it's not very pleasing to look at, specially on the black Nexus 5. I would've preferred they do some etching on the side or made it more discreet.  The lettering does wear and becomes less obnoxious after a little while. Going to probably take some nail polish remover to it when I'm bored.*updated* I gave the case another shot since I like it a lot and am happy to say that it hasn't pulled on my screen protector since the week I've put it back on.  Not sure if it wasn't totally on correctly the first time or what but it's still something to be wary of. I'm going to be leaving this case on and not fiddle with it and update it if it ends up breaking the screen protector.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009MZHGZ6" id="B009MZHGZ6-review28" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-07:</strong> Right away I noticed the small hole on the back that is next to the camera didn't line up.

Just FYI: the back panel is frosted pretty heavily, so if you are expecting to see the Nexus logo on the back, you'll have to hold the phone at an angle.  I wish the pictures on here showed the rear panel with a black Nexus 5 inside the case, as I didn't realize how heavily frosted the rear was with the white phone in the pics.  If i had, I'd have gotten one with a clear back instead.Case feels good in the hand, though, and seems to protect the phone well.  Port cutouts are well done, and the rear panel is thick enough to keep the camera lens from protruding through its opening, letting me lay the phone rear-down on a flat surface with confidence.I have only minor detractions on this case that kept me from giving a 5 star rating.  One, the buttons feel a bit mushy and lack the satisfying click when using the power/sleep button or the volume rocker.  Two, I wish the side TPU part of the case had some texture to enhance grip.Overall, a great buy for the price, and the rear translucent part seems to be staying fixed to the TPU bumper part well.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009MZHGZ6" id="B009MZHGZ6-review31" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-18:</strong> I got couple of other and this one is my favorite.

The advantage to this dual case from Incipio is that it comes in a variety of different color combinations and you're able to get two contrasting colors (white/gray looks really good on a white iPhone). The inner silicone case goes on very easily, but provides minimal support and feels exactly like a balloon that hasn't been inflated. The case covers some of the buttons on the side, but it is still easy enough to press them.The outer case provides some much needed protection and it slides right on over the silicone inner layer. The sliding on wasn't as easy as I was anticipating and once in place you can see a few spots where the outer layer does not provide any protection (top/bottom). Once both layers are in place the phone has a nice sturdy feel without having too much bulk added.Overall this is a decent case, but there were better options out there from Belkin and Case Mate that only had one hard outer layer that felt sturdier and was easier to put on and take off. You could use just the outer layer of this case without the inner silicone, but I wouldn't recommend solely using the inner layer.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003SX0OWA" id="B003SX0OWA-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-13:</strong> I've used this line of case since I bought my iPhone 4s. I love the fact that it covers your whole phone including the buttons with holes just big enough for the camera and speaker/microphone. The silicone sleeve comes around over the edge of the screen so it adds protection if you place the phone face down.

I bought it for a new iPhone 4S.  I must say, this is one of the best cases I've ever owned for a phone.  I've bought everything from the cheapest cases to the most expensive for past phones.  One of the most expensive cases I've ever owned was a Droid case that started out okay but literally fell apart at the seams after a few months.  This case is holding up very well.  It's a silicone case, so if you're particularly rough or harsh on your phone, expect fast wear and tear.  I use my iPhone regularly but I'm careful with it and never beat it up or throw it around as I've seen a lot of others do.  Not only do my phones look the same at the end of my contract as they did the day I bought them, but cases last pretty good as well.  So for that expensive case to fail, it really must have been rubbish.  This affordable case on the other hand, is not rubbish and fits the phone like a glove.  It offers a stylish non-slip gripping surface, and all buttoins, cameras, and openings have perfect cut-outs.  Nothing is obstructed, not even partially.  My 4S fits perfect.  The only intentionally covered buttons are the volume buttons and power button.  The thickness and flexibility of the case is just right, allowing me to easily push the buttons whenever needed, even without looking.  The bottom of the scase is cut so perfectly, it allows my iphone to fit on my speaker dock without removing the case.  Now that is a major plus.  I mainly carry the phone in my pocket and occassionally some lint will intrude, but it's nothing a can of spray air and a quick wipe with a cloth can't fix.  If anything gets really bad or a lot of debris finds its way into the case, the case is easily removable for cleaning or whatever the need may be.  I am very happy with this case and very satisfied with my purchase.  This has become my new iPhone case of choice.  And the price only makes it better.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003SX0OWA" id="B003SX0OWA-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-09:</strong> I bought this based on price and some reviews.

It almost looks like it doesn't fit right on the phone.

First of all, it is good looking.  The pink on grey is very pretty.  It's kind of a "hot pink".  Not really a magenta or pepto-pink.  You start with the stick-on protector.  The one it comes with is the glossy as opposed to the matte.  I prefer the matte, but I'm finding things I like about the glossy.  For one thing, it went on a lot easier than a matte and I didn't have as much trouble getting the bubbles out.  Then you slip on the silicone sleeve, which is a cinch to put on, and then that is covered by the hard plastic, which feels kind of soft and velvety to the touch...not slick and shiny.  It fits on my iPhone 4 perfectly.(I don't know about the 4S)  And that's it.  It's not bulky, yet I feel like my phone is fairly safe in this case if I happen to drop it.  It's got looks AND functionality!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003SX0OWA" id="B003SX0OWA-review22" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-02-26:</strong> great color fits good and does what it needs to do!

Excellent reception, call quality and battery life. It's a steal at this price. It has good looks even though it may not look so good in the picture.This phone is a quadband phone which means you can use it across the globe. The fact it doesn't have 3g is not a problem for calling or receiving. The call clarity or reception don't decrease because of that. The keyboard is awesome. We have a Nokia E5, but when compared to that, this phone's keyboard is far better and the phone itself is very sturdy and gives a good feeling when holding to your ears (you might have noticed that some phones really don't feel well near the ears).We have an Android touchphone too. Touching, sliding and tapping to receive calls or dial call is a pain. It's a shame that this whole world is bent on features forgetting the basic functionality of the phone which is calling and receiving calls. It's so disappointing there are not many non-smart phones with good reception and call quality. And there are fewer flip phone with those qualities.Added in June 2012:This phone is going steady. We have two phones and one is being used by my teenage son. He has dropped it at least twenty times in front of me (imagine how many times he would have dropped when I was not there!), but it continues to work without any issues. He has a hard cover for the phone but most of the times when he dropped it, the cover, battery cover and battery will fall apart. But it will always work after putting them together. Once he lost it while walking on the footpath when it was snowing and got it only after a couple of hours. I immediately switched it off, removed the battery and let it dry for a day. And it worked again! I hope and pray Nokia will continue to manufacture good quality dumb phones like this.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004P8JL76" id="B004P8JL76-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-04:</strong> Nice n great phone for the price.

Doesn't add a lot of bulk to the phone and unlike some of the leather cases, won't make my phone do weird things, like running appswithout my knowledge. I'm not sure why, maybe it's the magnets in them, but certain apps would always be running when I took the phone out. I just couldn't trust them. This is the case I prefer. In time, the belt clip gets sloppy and the phone won't stay vertical, the tight fit between the holster and case deteriorates but for $10, it's no big deal to replace.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0040LX9US" id="B0040LX9US-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-09-05:</strong> I bought this over a month ago.

Sadly today I paid for this when i accidentally dropped the phone in the street and it got scuffed up. Lesson learned I will be using the case permanently. I really love the feel of it as well the phone wont slip out of your hands as easily. I don't use the belt clip but it seems durable as well and easy to use.

It is a little bulky, but that is part of the compromise of a case and holster combo.  It is probably the least bulky of these types of combos I have seen.  I use it at work on my belt. and love it.  The case provides good protection and provides good grip/texture.  Months ago, I accidentally backed over the holster portion with an ambulance, I just bent the edges back to normal with my fingers, and it has continued to work flawlessly, with no visible evidence of being run over by a heavy vehicle.  The clip even works as new.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0040LX9US" id="B0040LX9US-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-02-02:</strong> We've tried two other cases before this one and it is by far the easiest to get on/off your belt.  The Droid X is secure and slips in and out of the case with little effort. It is also less bulky. The only slight downside is the top edges are not protected as well as some.  It is made with high quality, rigid plastic with a texture.BTW: if you need a non belt clip case for your Droid X with a gel-type or snap on cover, try the Case Logic VHS-101 Portable Hard Drive Case.  It's the only one I've found that will fit.

When it finally came out I could'nt wait to get it, been handling my phone with kid gloves...lol.  I loved the price compared to the verizon stores $45.00 and its exactly the same product. I used the holster mainly when I am working and it holds up great, keeps the phone in place. And I just use the shell when I am not working. The shell is still thin enough that the phone fits comfortably in my pants pocket and not difficult to take out to anawer/text. I also have a Zagg screen shield installed and the shell goes perfectly with it. Recently my wife switched out her silicone phone cover for her Incredible due to the fact it was lifting the corners off her Zagg screen shield. I ordered her a shell/holster combo for her phone and its been working great.PRODUCT UPDATE: (05/30/11)Well, I got into a car accident about a month ago and I had my phone in my holster, which was clipped to my belt. When I crashed, I guess I hit something in the car which pinned my phone/holster against me and the car interior. The holster did a great job protecting my phone, however the holster took a hit. A small pin that attaches the clip to the holster was bent and the clip closes crooked now, still works though. Needless to say, I am on here again to buy the same shell/holster. Too bad I can't just buy the holster, the shell protecting my phone is scratched up, but still works great.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B0040LX9US', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B0040LX9US', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00H9HRR1W</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00H9HRR1W</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00H9HRR1W" id="B00H9HRR1W-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-28:</strong> I LIKE THE WAY IT FEELS WHEN I HOLD IT.

Haven't tried any of the &#34;accessory&#34; &#34;clip ons&#34; because I'm pretty much satisfied with just how the case is as I got it.  One thing I'd like to point out.  I started off with a MUCH more expensive Otterbox case for my Note 3... Which did NOT have a cover for the stylus... which also promptly fell out and got lost.  The TRIDENT case on the other hand DOES have a little &#34;port&#34; cover which pretty much sets it apart from almost every other case I checked out.  The fact that it was half the price of my Otterbox case... with a better selection of features... that was just icing.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00H9HRR1W" id="B00H9HRR1W-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-06:</strong> If you are on the go a lot (and I mean like running around, moving, and being outdoors), this is the case for you.  Also nice to have a removable kick stand and you get the optional connector for the car mount or any other base (like the tripod stand is cool too).  99% good fitment (mine came with the corner slightly warped but it still closes and still protects just like an Otterbox Defender.  I like how the outer case has a place where I can tie off 4 lanyards if I wanted to suspend the phone for photos if I use those retractable lanyard cords, pretty cool stuff).  There's also the typical lower centered lanyard hole you can use as ell show in the picture of the 2 little holes on the bottom of the back of the case.  The screen protector is ok for what it is and I had to use some anti-static methods to clean the screen before installing it as I hate having stuff between the glass and screen protector.  At the end of the day, this case rocks like no other at half the cost.Edit and update:  so after looking around and making sure I didn't miss anything, my package was indeed was missing the belt clip/holster.  Rather than just sending the whole thing back to Amazon, I was able to get in with contact with Trident via email (cs@tridentcase.com) which I found this this email address from their website FAQ section.  I sent the email stating that my package never had one and I spec'd them what I bought and they are sending me out a new one.  What a nice company!  Also in their FAQ if your belt clip broke, you can also contact them directly for a replacement as well.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00H9HRR1W" id="B00H9HRR1W-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-29:</strong> I ended up getting an aegis case instead of the kraken.

With triple layer of protection this case can withstand a very high level of abuse, and it has been tested to Military Standards to meet or exceed MIL-STD-810L requirements. What makes it so tough? Let's take a closer look.Just like all other Trident cases, it arrived in a box with a clear front display and a full view of the case where the back of the box had details of all the features. The side of the box also includes icons of available AMS attachments. AMS is actually stands for Adaptive Modular System which enables various attachments/accessories to be connected to the back of the outer exoskeleton shell. The case design starts with an inner soft silicon shell, which is actually sold by itself as Perseus AMS case for Note 3. This is a light duty soft sleeve case which you can use as standalone for the occasions when you need just a minimal scratch and bump protection. Once you are ready for a more serious protection, you place Perseus AMS case into a heavy duty exoskeleton shell made out of hardened PC material with reinforced TPE corners. The same TPE material is used to fully seal power and volume buttons (still allowing an easy access and tactile response), and to protect with flexible port covers headphone, micro-usb, and s-pen ports. This outer shell also features a loop for lanyard to add more security when handling this case outdoors, and opening for sliding AMS accessories. The TPE corners also work as skid pads to prevent case from sliding across the surface.In order to enhance screen protection of your Note 3, Kraken AMS adds a front frame with an attached screen protector, similar to Cyclops series model. This adds an ultimate screen scratch protection and seals the screen for use in a light rain, dust, or wind. It doesn't make this case waterproof since you still have openings for home buttons, speaker, camera and notification light, but it gives you a piece of mind if you need to use your phone or take a call outside when elements of nature are not in your favor. As part of AMS system, you get one of the accessories bundled with a case - multimedia kickstand. Solid metal construction, its a nice interlocking kickstand for landscape/portrait positioning of your phone to enjoy watching a movie or YT video, etc. In addition, this Kraken AMS case also comes with a unique belt clip holster. We all know how big Note 3 is to begin with, so using an even bigger holster would add more bulk to carry on your belt clip. Here, Trident came up with a minimal design approach of a slim holster bracket with a clip that can rotate 360 degree and securely attaches to the front of your phone/case.Overall, this is one tough case to consider if you are looking for a serious protection for your Note 3 and would like to have flexibility of either slimming it down or adding more options as part of it's modular system.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00H9HRR1W" id="B00H9HRR1W-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-13:</strong> Beware if you order this case, because you might end up with this one, because I&#8217;m sending it back!  I thought it would be safe to buy a case that is fulfilled by Amazon&#8230;I thought my odds of getting ripped off would be less likely.  Not this time!  This case was not only opened and used&#8230;it must have been returned and re-sold in faulty condition.  First, the container arrived dirty, tattered, and half open.  I took the case out and noticed the rubber bumpers were dirty.  I looked closer and the screen protector looked like it was pushed in and it there were smudges all over it, and there&#8217;s a crease in the screen protector near the home button.  I opened the case and there was hair and/or sting-like stuff on the inside of the screen protector part of the case.  The belt-clip is a flimsy piece of s***.  Finally, the kick-stand doesn't stay closed.  It just flops in and out.  This case has obviously been used.  The one good thing I can say about this case is that it truly looks tough&#8230;like it can take a beating.  Unfortunately, this case has already taken a beaten.  I CANNOT ACCEPT THIS!  It must go back.  If I had owned this for 6-months and it looked like this&#8230;fine.  But I cannot accept this looking this way brand new straight out of the box.  No way.  I paid $12 for a cheap rugged case for my son, and it&#8217;s a way better deal than this!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00H9HRR1W', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00H9HRR1W', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B002USWA80</h2>    <p class="price"> $B002USWA80</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B002USWA80" id="B002USWA80-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2009-05-12:</strong> LUCE BIEN PERO SOLO ES UN CARGADOR CUANDO BIEN PUDIERON HABERLO DISE&Ntilde;ADO PARA QUE INCLUSIVE PERMITA LA SINCRONIZACION QUE SERIA LO IDEAL PORQUE UN STAND DE ESCRITORIO COMO ESTE NO TIENE MUCHO SENTIDO PONERLO EN LA COMODASIN EMBARGO CREO QUE INVOLUCRARIA REDISE&Ntilde;AR LA BLACKBERRY TAMBIEN ;-)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B002USWA80" id="B002USWA80-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2009-11-23:</strong> It does what it is supposed to do and does it with style.

The pod charges through two contacts on the bottom of the Blackberry on each side. If you have a gel skin, you'll have to remove it so it can charge.Charging your Bold just by the Micro USB cable is fine, but if you want to go for aesthetics and also reduce the wear on your Micro USB port, this is a great solution for you.

However, if you have used Micro USB before, it is MICRO.  I find it cumbersome at times due to its size......especially in the evening before I retire for the night.  The DOCK uses the charger that was included with your Bold 9700..simply plug it into the back of the dock and it is ready to go.  When you need a charge...drop the bold into the dock and forget about it.  No more messing with the connector....It is an AWESOME buy for the price..you cannot go wrong and you will not be disappointed.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B002USWA80', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B002USWA80', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B008JJFKN6</h2>    <p class="price"> $B008JJFKN6</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008JJFKN6" id="B008JJFKN6-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-15:</strong> I've charged two different batteries and it seems adequate (one OEM and one cheap 3rd party).  I leave them charging overnight, so I'm not sure how long it takes.  I wish it had an auto-shutoff function.  The light turns pink when charging, blue when complete, OR when there's no battery in the charger.  Therefore, it is always using a little bit of energy.  Also, I notice that when I connect the battery and the charger isn't even plugged in, that the blue light comes on.  This indicates that it is draining the battery in this case.  Makes me wonder what is happening when battery is still plugged in and has completed charging.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008JJFKN6" id="B008JJFKN6-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-16:</strong> I needed something to charge a spare battery on the go and this seems to be doing a good job</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008JJFKN6" id="B008JJFKN6-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-27:</strong> This charger is very convenient.

I have used this battery charger several times.  It works as it should.  It has a nice feature - a large lighted bar indicating the status of the charge.  The light is red until the battery is fully charged.  Once charging is complete the light changes to blue.  I also used this charger to charge both my battery and my phone via the USB outlet on the charger.  Both battery and phone charged successfully.  If you intend to charge your phone at night but light disturbs your sleep I would recommend plugging the device in somewhere out of your line of sight as the light shows brightly in the dark.  I did have an initial concern.  The battery for my S3 is wider than the charger.  It does not fit snuggly into the charger.

My phone is in a Ballistic Jewel Protective case, and it sets in the stand with plenty of room to spare. If you have a thicker more protective case, like an Otterbox,  this would still work as advertised.  I am able to use this stand during charging.  There is plenty of room in the middle of the base for the charger to be inserted while standing vertically.  You will have to bend your charging cord a bit at first so that it sits or lays right in the stand, but that is not a big deal.  I bought two!  One for my nightstand, and one for my table downstairs.  It is very useful!  I prefer using this so I can see my screen, instead of just having it flat on a table and needing to pick it up to look at it.

It is made of a rubber that is hard to clean and is flat black. It is also hollow inside so I stock two different charging cables in the hollow cavity & cut a wire clothes hanger & drilled a hole in the bottom section to hold the cables in, that works perfect. That way one can just pick it up and place the phone on it and run the charging cable to it either in the vertical or horizonal position. In the vertical position I use one of the flat instead of a round cable and it works perfect to run under this stand & connect the phone. I don't leave it hooked up since I have a regular charging dock which is taped to the desk. This is made of a rubber than prevents it from moving around also. Holds iPhones, iPads very well. Simple and user friendly stand.

The screen is so amazing that it honestly hurt my eyes a little for the first hour or so (in the same way that a new glasses prescription hurts - your brain is getting so much more visual information than it's used to, so it needs a minute to adjust). As a teacher, one of my favorite features is S-Beam. S-Beam allows you to send a file to another Samsung phone, just by tapping the two phones back-to-back. When I need to give each of my students a copy of a handout, I no longer need to print one for each student. I print copies for those without Samsungs, but for those students who have Samsungs, I just walk around the room and &#34;bump&#34; the file to each of them.In case anyone reading this has read that sometimes when you order a phone online, what arrives is a knockoff, I will say that when I got my phone, I checked all of the tell tale signs for knockoff S4's and the phone I received is definitely authentic.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CIF9MJK" id="B00CIF9MJK-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-03:</strong> Got it on time  and of course LOOOVE the the phone itself , Works just perfect and i hope there will be no issues with it .

Here's what I like about the phone:Beautiful screen - for those of us who don't have perfect vision, this screen is very readable. The fonts are an appropriate size, with good contrast.Nice speed. The screen is responsive, and allows multiple windows to be open at once.Screen size:  For certain apps, I.e. the kindle app, this screen approximates an e-reader very well (as opposed to reading on a smaller phone screen.)The interface is very thoughtfully designed.  Great job, Samsung!  Unobtrusive, noninvasive methods of accessing critical apps are available from almost anyplace on the phone.Icons/graphics are adorable, and creatively designed.  No boring manila folders on this phone!  Your folders show contents from the outside of the folder... Cute.Ease of use:  There is a little bit of a learning curve on this phone (I had the Samsung Epic previously), but I've pretty much figured it out in a few hours.  It's going to be great. Once you get the hang of the graphics, it's really quick to move things around, personalize, etc.It really blurs the boundary between a tablet and a phone, without becoming too huge, like the Note (which I am now glad I did not buy).Voice quality: I'd read reviews in the last few days that state that it is not very good... I think it's fine. The sound is clear, and volume is fine.One of my favorite apps for Android:  Out of Milk.  Running out of groceries?  Scan the bar code into one of your shopping lists, (or input by voice or typing), and your shopping list is complete.  I keep a running shopping list for Trader Joes, and my other local market.  When I go to the store, I simply move the items I need to the top of the list, and go for it!  No more paper lists!One heads up: (carrier, not phone related):  check on Visual Voicemail.... I use it all the time, and really like it.  I was surprised to discover that I had to pay for it as an add on with Verizon.... It was part of my Sprint service previously.** UPDATE **I've had the phone for almost a week, and it's simply a PLEASURE to use!  Lots of nice touches:  pop up asking if you'd like to add someone to your contacts after a call from a non contact, for example.Camera:  is great.  I photographed an entire exhibit in a museum.... No flash, in dark rooms, and the photos are stunning.Battery life:  surprisingly good!  I used the phone all day yesterday, on and off trains where it would have been seeking service in tunnels (usually drains battery quicker), used my Kindle app, made calls, sent texts and emails, and I still had 60% at the end of a ten hour day.Battery recharging:  using the charging cord that comes with the phone, it charges in no time... A couple of hours at most.  I've been amazed at the recharge speed, compared to my previous phone.Kindle app is like a baby Kindle... there's just enough on the page to not feel like you are only reading a few sentences at a time like on some smaller devices.I'm so pleased with my choice,  I hope you enjoy it, also.(And in case this is helpful to anyone:  if you are debating about a case, I have the Seidio holster case... Please see my review.)*************Enjoy this great device!  Questions?  Drop a note, and I'll get back to you.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CIF9MJK" id="B00CIF9MJK-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-22:</strong> My daughter loved her Christmas present this year.

However once again the camera lens and flash are hindered by the 'too small&#34; opening where the camera and flash peaks out. when using the flash on you camera the light bends and causes your pictures to have a haze, so you have to take the case off before you can take a photo with the flash on, this can be quite annoying.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BYJMJ5A" id="B00BYJMJ5A-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-22:</strong> I love this case!

I came across this case on thisiswhyimbroke.com and fell in love with it.  I buy all of my cases from Amazon, so this time was no different.  The item arrived in 3 days (NY to PA) and is exactly as described.  It fits perfectly, the rubber buttons are cut out and colored accordingly, it's exactly as it appears in the picture.

It looks almost EXACTLY like the classic Game Boy I used to play back in high school down to the most remarkable detail.All holes for the headphone jack, volume buttons, speakers and charger are perfectly placed and I am MORE than a little impressed with the coverage that wraps all the way around to the border of the front screen!My only tiny complaint is that I would like the rubber to be the *slightest* bit thicker, as right now it's a pretty floppy material with a bit more extra "give" when it could possibly be a tighter fit.However, overall I am extremely happy with this cute little novelty protective rubber case. Looks like it will provide excellent protection in case of drops or falls, and with two little boys (ages 2 and 4) running around my house the odds are great! ;)Thanks so much to Hong Kong for the speedy shipping and wonderful products. I will absolutely be back to buy more!!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BYJMJ5A" id="B00BYJMJ5A-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-03-07:</strong> This is a reeeaallly cool case! I've gotten lots of "ooh is that a gameboy?" and "thats cool" comments with it, and i've barely had it a week. I ended up with two cases because the first one took 2 months to arrive so I ordered another one.One does have the "nintendo Game boy" the other one from boho tronics doesn't; although some one did post earlier that the one they got from boho tronics did...i guess it's just luck.Like many have stated, the silicone is pretty thick so it should protect it from a fall.Pros;-Definitely looks really cool-Thick silicone that should be enough to protect from a fall although I wouldn't count on it.Cons;-I think it's just luck of the draw whether you get one that has the "nintendo game boy" logo or not. I ordered one from a seller that someone else claimed shipped the ones with logo on them, but mine did't come with the logo. :( Fortunately I had another that did.-Since it's silicone it will stretch after a fair amount of use.Overall though it is a sturdy retro case :)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BYJMJ5A" id="B00BYJMJ5A-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-04-26:</strong> This case was very appealing to me since I have been a fan of gameboy since it debuted, and for only a couple dollars I decided why not! First of all the shipping took place from China so don't expect to receive the case in under a week. So about the case...The case is a simple semi-thick silicone case (much like the cheap silicone cases from ebay, amazon, etc). You can clearly see the seam from the machine, but again it was only 2 dollars. The gameboy detail is actually very well made, I originally assumed that it might be a print, but actually there are raised buttons and "gameboy screen". This case fits well and all ports and openings are accessible. However, the camera cut out provides a lot of flash back, and the long sides seem to be stretched out. All in all for two dollars it's a fun case to have and show your friends, also will provide adequate protection when having a night out on the town.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BYJMJ5A" id="B00BYJMJ5A-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-13:</strong> I think I must have received the new and improved case because mine doesn't have any of the imperfections that other customers have been listing.

I think most kids these days who use this case have probably never seen the original Game Boy (just as they probably haven't ever used a cassette tape!), but I have gotten a lot of compliments from my peers who had Game Boys when they were younger. It looks good and has the appropriate holes for the camera and flash, dock connector, headphones, etc. The one I bought does NOT have the Game Boy TM written on it, but it's still recognizable as a Game Boy lookalike.Like other reviews have mentioned, this does give your photos a bit of a hazy look when you use flash, but it's nowhere near as bad as the SGP case I was using before. I don't use flash often so this isn't a problem for me. The fit is a little off -- it could be a little tighter -- and it does collect a little lint when I put it in my coat pocket, but overall I really like this case!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BYJMJ5A" id="B00BYJMJ5A-review32" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-06:</strong> Looks cool but fits poorly.

The material is unfortunate.  It gets soaked when sweaty and it actually slides down my arm, which is a distraction while running and even a hindrance to my overall run.  The same issues with regards to the plastic casing are here, in that it can be hard to work the phone through the case.  Like I've mentioned in my review of the iPod armband, I basically hit shuffle on my playlist and hit the road, but with my phone there are times when I need to answer the phone, and so I need to be able to access the phone through the casing.  My biggest issue here though is the fact that the slot for the phone is so snug that it will not fit my phone unless I take the phone case off.  This is annoying, especially since I have one of those cases that is hard to take apart.  To top it all off, the design on this armband is CHEAP looking.  It looks terrible, and I know that looks aren't everything, but if the performance is bad and the look is bad then the product has no redeeming qualities.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009G5T9LG" id="B009G5T9LG-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-15:</strong> I've long needed a better armband for my gym workouts and the Belkin Pro-Fit Armband for iPhone 5 is definitely better than what I had been using previously.I'm actually using it for an iPhone 4 and it fits (a bit snug at first), provided I first remove my phone from its protective case.  It might be different if I used it for jogging, but for my gym needs (cardio and weights) it does what it needs to do.  I don't have the biggest biceps in the world but I've had no problems with it slipping once the clasp closure was adjusted.  And yes, as some of the other reviews have noted, the nylon backing gets pretty sweaty but because the inside is rubber-coated, the phone itself remains dry.The protective plastic screen, on the other hand, makes using your phone's touchscreen admittedly tricky but not impossible--during my workouts I only really need to access it for the music apps.All in all, it's easy to see where there would be room for improvement in subsequent versions, but, for my needs, it's still a more comfortable fit than my old armband.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009G5T9LG" id="B009G5T9LG-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-14:</strong> The way that it fits your arm is actually pretty interesting. The clip mechanism does make it easier to fit it into place than some other armbands I've tried in the past. Resizing it isn't terribly difficult. The material against your skin seems to be a wicking fabric that doesn't really provide a waterproof space, though shouldn't be an issue unless you're sweating extremely profusely.The actual iPhone compartment seems like it could've been shaped just a little better. The plastic over the screen sticks out in a way that makes the touch screen a little harder to use than it needs to be.It basically gets the job done, but it has enough minor issues that it's tough to say I'd enthusiastically recommend it over other options. They all seem to have their ups and downs (at least the ones I've tried out).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009G5T9LG" id="B009G5T9LG-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-29:</strong> Previous versions of this Armband, of which I've had a couple, had a velcro assembly.  This one has a traditional bracket/buckle approach which actually feels less secure and, because of the buckle, is more bulky.  Granted, the phone is bulky, but this adds to it and helps load up more weight on one side of your upper body.Further, addressing other review, I wanted to address just a couple things, more unique to me than anything:1. First, though, I've read that it doesn't hold the iPhone5.  It does.  Now, technically, the iPhone5 goes in upside down (there's a camera hole at the bottom of the inset, ostensibly to show you how to align the device).  This makes the iPhone completely snug in the slot.  However, it is upside down.  That's necessary if you are using earphones (the plug for that is at the bottom of the phone). I suppose that if you didn't put it on your arm upside down, the slot would be at the bottom, not the top, and you would worry that it would slide out.  I don't know if that's an issue, but it's definitely not an issue if you use the band as intended.2. I thought I might use this for the GPS capability on my phone.  I don't listen to music when I run.  However, the tightness and the jostling when running a fair distance (7 miles) left burn marks and cuts on my arm.  I'll wear it over a shirt in the winter, but overall, this makes the buckle thing even more of a pain, because it will take more time to adjust it based on the shirt I'm wearing.Overall, I recommend, theBelkin EaseFit Armband For New Apple iPhone 5 (Black).  My daughter has kidnapped that one and I'm hoping to convince her to trade....</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009G5T9LG" id="B009G5T9LG-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-27:</strong> Even on it smallest size, the arm band was too large for my arm.

It keeps the phone snug and secure, as well as protected from drops and sweat.  The phone is easy to slip and out of the band as needed.  The only complaint I could really make is that you cannot have on another case on your iPhone when fitting it into this band.  I have an elago slim case which is very slim, yet the phone wouldn't go into the armband until I took the case off.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009G5T9LG" id="B009G5T9LG-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-20:</strong> I'm a walker/runner and get really tired of having to hold my phone, so I was very excited to try the Belkin Pro-Fit Arm Band.  Overall, I feel it works as described.  I noticed some people complained that it was too tight, but I've got mine as tight as it will go and kind of wish I could make it a bit tighter.  I find that when I first start walking/running, I'm tugging it back up my arm because the material is very smooth.  I kind of wish it was a little tacky so it would stay put, but once I start moving and sweating, it doesn't move anymore.  The screen on the iPhone 5 is already horrible in sunlight and with the shiny plastic cover on this, it is nearly impossible to see the screen at all, so things like checking distance if you have a running app or changing songs is extremely difficult.  I also kind of wish the material that holds the phone in was a bit more stretchy so it could accommodate at least a very thin case.  I have to take my phone completely out of its very thin case to use this arm band and that is going to get old quick.  But, overall, the case does what it is intended to do.  I would love to see a less reflective plastic cover more than anything and I think that would be an easy change for Belkin.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009G5T9LG" id="B009G5T9LG-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-01:</strong> This my very first iPhone armband. I have owned many Belking electronics accessories and have always found them to be well built and nicely functional - usually at very competitive prices. When I has the opportunity to try this armband through the Amazon Vine program, I jumped on it as I have been walking more and had been thinking about getting such an armband. It looks every bit as good as it does in the pictures! Black and silver and quite handsome. The iPhone5 fits easily and snugly into the interior pocket and the earplug hole aligns well with the jack in the bottom of the iPhone. The material is light and flexible and I couldn't wait to go for my first listen-along walk with my iPhone strapped to my upper arm.The issue I encountered as soon as I began to put it on my arm has to do with sizing. The adjustment mechanism is tricky and requires a good deal of manipulation. This was necessary because it was just too large. It would begin to slide down my are almost right away, so I wanted to make it tighter. With it is small as I was able to get the strap to adjust down to, it was still too big to be secure while on a ling walk, a brief run or if sweating. For context, I am what I regard as a "Medium" size man. My biceps are just under 12". I would suppose that on a bigger person, this would work well, but I notice there is a review posted here from a man with 16" biceps who says that it is too small!It is possible that the problem is not so much with the product itself as it is with the advertising. The range of bicep sizes it is effective with probably should be overtly posted. "Best suited for people with biceps from 12" - 15" " might be an honest and USEFUL number to include in the product description. Perhaps it would be best sold in sizes S,M and L. Suggesting thast one-size-fits-all is both silly and inaccurate. It does not. 5 Stars for a nicely made product minus 3 Stars for incomplete product description = 2 Stars.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009G5T9LG" id="B009G5T9LG-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-14:</strong> Looking at this case in the promo shots, and also when you first put it on, makes it look really nice.  Streamlined, sporty, stylish.  Unfortunately the function of the case is pretty bad.My issues:- There is this really cool patented Belkin 'hinge' that you adjust the band around, and then undo the hinge and it allows you to put the armband on/off, next time you put it on it will be the same tightness.  Which is great, except I found it really easily to get my skin caught in it on my arm.  Left me with at least one bruise.  Great concept, but could use a bit more work.- Phone sits 'below' the armband.  This means it looks good from the top, but the phone is pushing into your arm, including the headphone jack (this is annoying).  You can also feel the phone itself pressing into your arm.  Also because there is a whole for the headphone jack, sweat can also get in there.Other designs that put the iPhone above the band, solve most of these issues, but don't look as good.  I wanted to love this case, but after about 2-3 miles with it, I ended up taking it off and putting my phone in the pocket instead.  Switched back to my (cheaper) TuneBelt instead (and this isn't a great case, but beyond this one).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009G5T9LG" id="B009G5T9LG-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-20:</strong> Like other reviewers, I found this armband to be very small. I was able to get it on my arm, but barely, and when I velcroed it on, it was absurdly tight. I know some of you may be wondering about my body build. Well, I am not obese by any means. I do lift weights, but I am also a woman, so am not bulky. I think most people who wear an armband will probably be working out and not necessarily have tiny arms as this band seems meant for, and therefore, it should be made for a wider variety of people.It was also difficult to get my iPhone in and out of the armband.Would I advise you buy this? No, not unless you plan to keep your phone in the armband all the time, and you have peculiarly small arms.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009G5T9LG" id="B009G5T9LG-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-19:</strong> After reading the reviews here I was almost afraid to try this, I'm an average sized woman... who would like to loose about 25-30lbs (ie my arms are not thin, but they also aren't huge either) as it seemed that most women complained this was way too big and men said it was too small. I was also worried about the fit, I'm happy to say that my iphone 5 fits in perfectly easy and is comfortably snug. I did have to remove my case which I was hoping I might not as it's a very slim case (the LuvvittLUVVITT CRISTAL Hard Shell Anti-Scratch Transparent Case for iPhone 5 (LIFETIME WARRANTY | Retail Packaging) - Crystal Clearwhich I highly recommend) as it just wouldn't slide in with it on, though that might have been due to the slight texture on the case more then the actual size. If I'm heading out to exercise though I'm already putting on specific clothing, shoes, etc... so 10 seconds to pop off my phone case isn't a huge deal. The touch screen isn't super easy to work through the plastic, but it's not terrible easy... just have to press a bit harder then usual, but again.. I'm not checking my emails or browsing facebook, I'm starting up a playlist and that's that. I had to tighten the band a bit out of the package, and then again about midway through a jog but I still have some room to tighten it further, I agree the band is a bit intimidating at first with no direction as to how to use it but again, it's not really hard either once you mess around with it for a few mins. All in all this serves it's purpose of keeping my iphone safe and close w/o resorting to a pocket it might fall out of and isn't uncomfortably or ugly to wear. I do feel these are a bit over priced but that doesn't change the actual product rating at all.

(But I haven't tried it with a screen protector on my phone.)CONS- It holds the phone snugly to your arm--if you're lifting with your arms you have to keep adjusting it.- The earphone hole is on the back and close to your skin, so when you're running and working out, it creates heat and condensation. So after every workout my phone was wet.- The inside of the case is so snug that you cannot have a case on your phone.Knowing all this, I would not likely buy it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009G5T9LG" id="B009G5T9LG-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-14:</strong> I use this armband with my iPhone 4s and my iPod nano (not both at the same time! and with a bluetooth dongle attached to the nano) for rollerskating along with some bluetooth headphones (I use the LG Tone - HBS-700). I was using my nano and dongle on a wristband, but then I started using wrist guards and could no longer wear a wristband, so I started using my iPhone 4s by putting it in the pocket of a shirt, but it's not that safe there and limits what I can wear and pulls awkwardly on that side of the shirt. So I tried this armband and it works great for my purposes (rollerskating).I wouldn't use this for any other active things I do...with the bluetooth headset my iPhone is safer in my panniers or else mounted to my handlebars when I'm riding my bike. For erging (stationary rowing) the arm movement is too extreme to hold this securely in place (and I'm better off just putting iPhone or nano off to the side somewhere.) Running I also think is too much movement and jostling. Also, of course this is not designed for the 4s, it's for the 5 iPhone (and certainly not for the nano) so it doesn't fit quite the same as it would with the proper device inside. It still works, though, and I can use the screen through the plastic, but with some difficulty. Not a good idea while riding a bike. Walking - it's not suited for a situation where you might be wearing a jacket or sweater and then later want to take it off. It might be a bit awkward over a jacket anyway.The strap fit me fine. I would say my upper arm is on the large size of medium/average for a woman. I'm basing this based on the size of elbow pads I was recently fitted for.This might not work for everyone or for every purpose, but it's just what I needed for drowning out the dreadful sound system at the roller rink!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009G5T9LG" id="B009G5T9LG-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-13:</strong> The iphone sure does fit snuggly in this arm band, which I guess is a good thing.

Once I get sweaty, it becomes a little slippery and it tends to slide when I swing a lot. I got medium size arms.  Also, it gets soaked which makes it kinda nasty.It is simple to use, just slide your phone on the top where there is an opening and flap. Makes sure you don't wear the strap upside down.  If you need to adjust the strap, you would need to tug inside.  That is where a Velcro strap has the advantage.I don't like the design on the surface.

The phone-envelope is too tight to slide the phone in without taking it out of any case you might have, and the envelope doesn't seal: the top flap just slides over top of the phone.All that being said, it's comfortable on the arm even when laced snugly.  It WILL slide down, but it won't unlace itself from your arm and fall straight to the ground or anything (I'm not really sure what really could be done to stop the slide, other than short up the headphone cord!)  The buttons (except the mute button) can be operated through the fabric, and there's a hole in the bottom of the envelope for the headphone jack.So it's a lot better than nothing, and I'm going to continue using it!  However if Belkin is listening, I'd like the envelope to be large enough to slide my cased iPhone into.  I'd like the sleeve to be sealable and waterproof, with a dot on the bottom I could cut out if I REALLY want to plug in the jack.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009G5T9LG" id="B009G5T9LG-review23" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-06:</strong> I am having trouble finding any redeeming qualities about this product. The first terrible flaw is that the phone will get wet while you run. The back panel in the compartment where the phone fits is not water proof, so your sweat will get to the phone. In my mind, this is a crucial element an armband should have, keep your phone dry so it does not get damaged. Total fail on this one.But it does not stop there, the plastic buckle they use for adjusting the armband is awkward and rubs against your skin by running. It was not bad enough to hurt my arm, but it is far from comfortable. I Velcro strap would make a lot more sense. Since I am talking about fit on the arm, I should point out that I found the level to which you can adjust the armband to be pretty limited. I saw reviews here about the armband being too small and others about it sliding down. In my case, I had to set it up to the smallest setting and it barely works. I am a male triathlete, so I have relatively thin arms, but I am pretty sure that anyone that has a runner's physique will find this armband to be too big.Finally, the product looks pretty ugly. So in summary, it doesn't protect the iphone properly, it is not comfortable and has limited range for adjustment and  it looks bad.

The 5 fits like a glove. I've got a fat, chubby upper arm, although it's getting smaller due to weight loss surgery. I have been putting off getting on the treadmill as holding the phone has been a pain - but it works great on my arm without slipping. My only criticism is the buckle is tricky to use... but once you have it adjusted, you don't have to do more adjusting later unless you're losing weight.

I have another Belkin armband that fastens using Velcro - I love it.

I used this armband while walking my dog to see how it performed in that situation.My first impression was that the armband was quite large and bulky, but after thinking about it, I don't see any way that they could reduce its size, so it's probably the size that it needs to be. Sliding an iPhone 5 into place is quite snug, and I found it easier to remove the case I was using than to wrestle with the plastic sleeve.It took some time to adjust the clip just right, but after it is adjusted, the clip makes it easy to use and remove the armband. I did find that it tended to slip, even when walking, so I can understand the issues reported by others while running. I think this has to be a matter of finding a balance between having it loose enough so it doesn't feel like a blood pressure band while still holding its place.Using the phone's touchscreen was pretty easy, even if the home button was partially obscured by the top portion of the band surround. This might just be a matter of shoving the phone further into the sleeve, but given the tightness of that sleeve, I think people will run into that issue more often than not.Comfort was OK for what it was. I don't think you can get away from feeling at least a little like you have a blood pressure band on, but that may go away with time.One aspect that I thought could be improved was in the flap that covered the phone after it is inserted. The flap completely covers the phone, which is probably good from a rain protection standpoint, it makes the flap stand up completely if you are using earbuds without a right-angle connector (such as the ones included with the iPhone 5). I would like to see either a hole for the headphone jack, or that part of the flap removed so the entire flap doesn't have to make room for an earbud connector.From reading the other reviews, it seems that there are some other armbands that people like, and they are a little cheaper than this one. While I don't dislike this armband, I don't see anything spectacular about it either. For my walking purposes, I'll probably go back to putting the phone in my pocket instead of wearing this armband, especially in the hot summer weather.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009G5T9LG" id="B009G5T9LG-review27" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-18:</strong> I like this armband. It is adjustable enough to move from forearm use (when bicycling) to the upper arm for walking. I prefer the feature of the clip that snaps over to snug the armband vs hook-and-loop type fasteners. You are still able to adjust the "belt" slightly after it is clipped in the closed position, for fine tuning. The flap that folds over the opening on the back, where you insert the phone, helps to secure the phone in position. For the headphone jack, since I have a right-angled connector, I preferred to feed it into the case and connect to the phone vs trying to connect to the phone through the opening.  I did not have any trouble operating the phone through the clear plastic cover the screen. The material is thin with a little give for comfort.

I normally don't bother with my iPhone and headphones during a workout, but it's something I've been wanting to try. Based on the results of this experiment, I'll go back to reading. This just didn't work on a number of levels.In order to get my iPhone in, I had to remove the case I use (which isn't that thick). Even with just the iPhone, the fit is very snug and is a bit of a hassle to get in and out (which you'll be doing plenty of). One I got it situated in the case, I tried putting it on my arm. It took a number of tries to adjust the band to get the right fit... somewhere between "don't move the arm or it will fall off" and "is this a blood pressure cuff?" The locking device doesn't seem to work very well, and it tended to dig into the skin. Even with the strap on fairly tight, it slipped down my arm repeatedly after just a little movement. At that point, it became worse than useless, as now I had to hold on to it during my workout. Add to that the fact that my sweat worked through the case, leaving the iPhone somewhat damp when I pulled it out. I'm sure that's not good for the long-term care of my iPhone...I still envy those people who seem to run effortlessly with their tunes on their arms. I may get there one day, but it won't be with this arm strap.Disclosure:Obtained From: Amazon Vine Review ProgramPayment: Free</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B009G5T9LG', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B009G5T9LG', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B000P7LHDW</h2>    <p class="price"> $B000P7LHDW</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B000P7LHDW" id="B000P7LHDW-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-22:</strong> I use this with a regular land line phone.

Then if I turned it up a notch, it shrieked.This new DECT 6.0 gives wonderful sound quality.  It is as good or better than the quality from the handset.  The wireless capability makes this even more convenient.My only complaint is that this unit is a bit bigger on the part that goes behind the ear than other units I have owned.  It makes for a difficult fit.  I never have a feeling of being able to ignore that it is there.Pros:o sound qualityo wireless capacity / distanceo easy to find accessories - this is a well known brandCons:o how it fits on the earOverall - I recommend this unit for the sound quality, which is the best of any unit I have owned.  If the fit were a bit better, it would get the full 5 stars.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B000P7LHDW" id="B000P7LHDW-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-03-25:</strong> Just received it this morning and feel strongly that I should write something about it. This is a really nice wireless headset. Setup in 5 minutes. Spend a little more time on 6 different ear pieces comes with it and decided on one with silicon gel that fits really good. The sound quality is decent and is comfortable to wear. It is also lightweight and I can barely felt it. Replacing the ear piece caused me to break one small cushion piece around the connector, but it can be avoided. Don't think it is a quality issue. The headset can be used for either right or left ear. Overall I am very happy about the purchase.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B000P7LHDW" id="B000P7LHDW-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-04-13:</strong> Over the years I have tried so many different brands of headsets and none of them worked like a Plantronics.

It is a basic silicon case, and does not include screen protection. The colors are great and really appreciated by the 13 year old recipient for her green iPhone 5C.The case fits the phone very, very well, all buttons are readily accessible, and it allows a secure grip.My only worry is that it will not be very protective if the phone gets dropped, but I have heard other people say that the plastic case of the 5c is quite sturdy, so it is the screen I worry about. I will look to add a really good screen protector, and we should be good to go. The phone and the case are Christmas presents, so I can't comment yet on the longevity of the case.I recommend this case for appearance, fit, and feel, but I have some concerns about how well it can protect the phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00ESJGNBO" id="B00ESJGNBO-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-10:</strong> This case is fun and functional. The colors are bright and cheerful, look nice with the phone and stand out in a bag or purse. It provides decent protection while not adding weight. But most importantly it does not block or otherwise interfere with the buttons. It provides good protection and seems sturdy enough to last. The frustration free recyclable packaging was a plus. If you are looking for basic protection, this is the ticket.

It's a two piece design that seems to protect the iPhone 5c quite well - I like the fact the the top ridge is a bit higher than other iPhone cases, allowing a bit more protection for the front glass.I call this a very good (4 star) product on its own, and the price make it that much better.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00ESJGNBO" id="B00ESJGNBO-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-30:</strong> I had the chance to try this case out and I will say it is built well, in fact it is just as good as the $30 name brand cases you would find elsewhere. It wraps the phone perfectly, isn't loose and stays put while giving your phone a new look. Obviously with no protection on the front you won't have 360 protection but it's known this case doesn't offer a cover so that is not to be expected. It does however have a small lip around the front so when you lay the phone down it won't rest on the phone screen, but on the lip of the case.I like it, and the price is great!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00ESJGNBO" id="B00ESJGNBO-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-04:</strong> This case is a style that I have seen before.  There is a yellow soft case (silicon) that goes around your phone, providing it with plenty of cushioning.Then, the hard green case (made of hard Polycarbonate PC) squeezes over the yellow case and keeps it on.The case fits correctly and doesn't block the speaker or where the plugs go (and yes, I've reviewed cases before that do!)It definitely provides more protection than many of the hard cases I've tried out, because the yellow part of the case is so soft.  I think it would adequately protect your phone from most drops, but, the worst drops would probably end up in a cracked screen.for me, well, its good enough.  Between my wife and I, we have owned about 9 iPhones since the first one was released and we've only had one screen shatter in all that time.  I don't like to use an otter box, it makes the phone too clunky despite the level of protection.  This case keeps the phone feeling slim and provides more protection than most of the Belkin cases I have reviewed.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00ESJGNBO" id="B00ESJGNBO-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-20:</strong> First of all this is a great cover for any Oregon Duck fan!!!!Second I love how the blend of silicone and plastic give a nice padding but also a small profile to the case (a nice blend of protection without being bulky)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00ESJGNBO" id="B00ESJGNBO-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-20:</strong> First what I really like about this case is that the lip wraps over the top of the phone.  I got the green and yellow color and I think its different.  It doesn't fit the most square around the phone but the phone does fit snuggly in the case.  The volume buttons are a bit hard to get to but still usable.  Power button works fine though.  When putting this case on being its two pcs,  you have to work a bit to get them in place.  last I just hope the lip that warps over the top can save my screen from a nasty drop.  where I work the ground is textured and it cracked my last phone,  case did have a big lip to protect it.  Being outterbox doesn't have a decent case out yet for the 5c and I didn't want a massive case with a screen protector covering the front.  This was a good inexpensive alternative.

I was expecting a simple dual color rubbery thin case like ones I have used in the past.What you get though is a seemingly very durable outer plastic shell with a smooth silky silicon inner skin. This serves well on both aesthetics and function.Installation is easy and once on it adds very little bulk. You can access all buttons without issue and the case feels like it will stand up to some good abuse.At the price, and really you can't beat it, the only hard decision is what color to get.

It does the job, but as another reviewer has commented the mini-USB plug is a little awkward.  This seems to be due to slight angle of plug to accommodate adapter use.  If the phone is tilted top forward slightly when inserting this works best.  To alleviate concern of the plug wearing the phone receptor I don't always set the phone fully onto the plug so that it charges.  The design could have been improved perhaps, but overall I'm satisfied.  It is handy having the phone setting upright at the corner of my desk making it easy to see who is calling.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FD2AQGI" id="B00FD2AQGI-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-10:</strong> nice simple dock for charging - heavy base keeps it upright, charges the phone, easy to insert, however even slim-fit case will not fit</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FD2AQGI" id="B00FD2AQGI-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-15:</strong> This cradle does what it says, charges the phone.

I did not have my AC charger or a laptop to charge from. I have an Ipad 2, which already gets great battery time, and I was able to restore my Ipad's battery to 100% from about 60-70% daily for three consecutive days without an AC charge. Without the Powerplant, my battery would have depleted to zero on my second day.I've noticed the reviews here swing wildly on the utility and reliability of this product.  All I can say is it worked well for me. With so many devices that can use this product, each with its own power demands and battery sizes, it is difficult to establish a reliable benchmark for comparison. I intend to use the Powerplant to "top off" my Ipad if it is low from heavy use during the day or from an inability to recharge the night before. It has its limitations because it is difficult to replicate an AC outlet. But, in the end, it is power in your pocket, and a great alternative to a dead device.  You can always try it, and if it doesn't meet your needs, return it to Amazon.Just a suggestion, but if you will lack the ability charge your device from an outlet or a computer, try and plan ahead: turn off GPS, turn off roaming for wireless networks, and reduce your screen's brightness. These are all battery hogs, and the more stretching of your battery's current charge, the less juice you'll need to charge it back up and the longer the Powerplant will last.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007G51X6C" id="B007G51X6C-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-18:</strong> This is a little on the pricy side -- I got to review through the Vine program -- but it was a real lifesaver for me recently on a couple of occasions.

It charged my iPhone 5 and my Kindle Paperwhite very quickly, all the way to full -- just as fast as plugging them into a wall charger.The unit comes with a tiny micro USB cable and a USB port for you to plug in any other sort of device (like an iPhone). However, it does NOT come with its own charger (though it does include a cable). You need to use one of your other device's chargers -- I usually use the one that came with my Paperwhite.One downside: It is fairly large and heavy.

But then again a spare battery is $8 and most won't have multiple devices.  My duracell has a cable but it's only 3 inches long and it can be reversed to charge it when needed.So the price point places it in the middle of the premium Duracells or the standard/cheapie chargers.  Given the reliability issues other's pointed out, I probably would go up or down in the product spectrum.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007G51X6C" id="B007G51X6C-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-27:</strong> At the current price (over $50) this is a tough sell, as there is a lot of competition in the market right now for similar battery packs.  This pack does feature a full 2.1 amp capacity, a built-in micro-USB cable, and a sleek design. However you are paying about $5.00 per watt which is high compared to other similar devices.  That said, the unit seems well made and does a nice job. It does not come with an A/C adapter for charging, you have to charge from your computer or supply your own A/C adapter. It does include a separate micro-USB cable which can be used for charging the device itself and your phones, tablets, or other devices. Together with the built-in micro-USB cable, this means you can charge two devices at one time.The included instructions are very brief and do not even mention charging the device itself except for a diagram that sort of shows the device connected to an A/C adapter (not included) port for charging (but this would be unclear to someone not familiar with these devices, I think).Here's what the manufacturer says about their not including an A/C adapter:Q: Was the PowerPlant suppose to come with a wall charger?A: The PowerPlant does not include a wall charger since it was designed with a universal micro-USB port. It does include a micro-USB cable which you can plug into any USB port to charge your PowerPlant. TYLT is committed to sustainability and providing excellent user experiences. This eliminates the need to manufacture thousands of wall chargers, reducing our ecological footprint.The unit has some built-in intelligence and you can leave it plugged in and it will not over-charge the internal battery, you can also "top off" the battery without any harm (no memory effect). TYLT says it will hold a charge for one year and that the internal battery is rated fro 500 full cycles (about standard for these devices).Here's another bit of useful information not included in the user guide (the Q&A; FAQ is at the TYLT web site):Q: How do I know that the Powerplant is fully charged?A: While charging the Powerplant all 4 LEDs will turn off signifying that the device has a full 100% charge.I struggled with rating this device.  It has a premium price, so the "value" proposition is low.  But it does have a good design and features. Reliability is unknown (I note some earlier reviews indicating some quality control issues, hopefully those have been resolved by now). The device has a one year warranty. Overall, it is a good design, with attractive styling, and it has the built-in micro USB cable which is nice. I am going to be generous and give it 4 stars based on the full 2.1 amp power-rating and features. For now, that's my best judgement for the TYLT UPPLANT2-T.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007G51X6C" id="B007G51X6C-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-11:</strong> Firstly, the Tylt PowerPlant is a portable 'battery driven' charger in which you do not need to plug it into a wall to use its power. You will plug it into a USB charger to charge this PowerPlant when it depletes however that is only after you have used it.When I say "battery-driven" I do not mean that you need batteries to run this because it is an enclosed rechargeable device.This being said, this mini 'PowerPlant' does exactly what is described to do. Think of this as a very small and portable laptop charging station for your USB devices.[---Testing---]Ipod completely decharged (note you should not do this to your own device as for maximum life you should start charging your devices at around 20% of battery life) recharged completely in less than an hour.The PowerPlant, after charging the iPod, still had half its life left.-------------To charge the PowerPlant, you will need a USB charger input (as mentioned above). The cord with a mini-USB male connector is included with it so that you do not have to buy it separately.[---Size---]About 3" or about 7.5 cm long and about 2" wide or 5 cm. Is very light and needs no mention with regards to weight.** When using, it had (4) green LED lights on the outside which tell you how much life is left on the PowerPlant, it will also display how much life is left on the device being charged **------------------------------------As there are many times I have had devices fail because I did not expect that I would be using it heavily during certain times, or when I forgot simply to bring a charger or had no place to charge my devices from. For the traveler, or for a convenient means to quickly charge your devices from a high quality 'battery pack' the Tylt is a prudent buy in the field of prevention.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007G51X6C" id="B007G51X6C-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-27:</strong> I have used this power bank for several weeks, and so far I like it, though I don't love it.

It is a brilliant solution for those who travel with mobile devices (and often too many cords and chargers). This unit can be used with effectively anything that charges via usb.The manufacturer claims that t will hold its charge for a year and charge a phone for up to 12 hours.  I have not had it long enough (or batteries worn down enough) yet to check that claim, but it will recharge your phone or tablet in a pinch.  It also works with other devices, but I know from experience it does not last as long with netbooks.The batttery has a micro usb andc universal female usb ports and can charge 2 devices at once.  It also comes with a 1 year manufactuer's warranty.The Unit has an led which shows the charge level and comes with a usb charging cable.  This is the only thing which took it down a notch for me.  It takes a lot longer to recharge via usb than ac or dc, and if you are on the road with devices running out of juice, do you want to plug it into one to charge another?  They do refer to it as a home charging cable, but that is somet5hing to bear in mind, and is not an issue with the similarSanyo eneloop KBC-L2B Mobile Boosterwhich comes with a plug in charger as well.  he Sanyo is also a bit lighter, but may not hold a charge as long.  Thus far I am fiding them both useful and only in extreme circumstances would one likely need more.

What this means is the 4 green LEDs will not give you an accurate indication of remaining capacity. For example many times while charging a device that's plugged into this battery pack, only one LED will be lit which would suggest around 20% or less capacity remaining. This however is not accurate because if you unplug the device and let the battery sit for awhile the one LED will change to 2, 3 or even 4 when the voltage is allowed to recover.With that said there's a built-in flexible rubber flip out micro USB cable in addition to a standard USB port behind a protective rubber flap. Both can be used at the same time regardless whether or not the battery pack itself is being charged. Build quality is ok and the battery pack is not too large but the shape is not ideal for pocketing.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007G51X6C" id="B007G51X6C-review22" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-04:</strong> I have this charger for a couple of weeks now and finally got a chance to use it. I had the UPPLANT2 on full charge and took it with me on a long trip. I plug my iPad in when the iPad was down to 65% battery, and continue to play video for another 2 hours. At the end of 2 hours my iPad got to 95% charge, but the UPPLANT2 was down to nothing! May be there is still some juice in there as the iPad still show the lightning bolt (charging), but no LED lights left.  I believed if I only charge the iPad and not playing video, performance will much be better. If you plan to use this charger with your smartphone, I think you will get more out of it. I have a Kensington battery pack model K38201 that could charge a single iPhone, but is much thinner and more portable. The Kensington could probably bring my iPad to about 30% charge from empty, so the UPPLANT2 definitely packs more power!The device is compact, only about 3 1/2' x 1 1/2" x 1", so it is easy to toss into the briefcase. Add a couple of charging cables for your devices and you are all set. On the road, you can charge it with your computer or a USB charger, just remember this device takes microUSB as input. I also used this device with my personal hotspot, and it worked great!

For one, the four LED light indicator is unreliable. It will show four light, drop to two in a matter of minutes. Attempting to charge is a bit challenging at times because I am unsure if it is working. I'll plug in my iPhone, turn on the Powerplant and the lights will go blank, while other times they will stay on for a bit. As well, why not ship with an ACTUAL wall charger? It's not always convenient to charge from your laptop with the provided cable. I'm not a fan of electronics that rely on this type of charging cable. I think the company should rethink the design to create a series of Powerplants which focus on certain electronics, such as a Powerplant specifically for iPhones/iPads with two male ends right on the Powerplant for both old and new iPhone adapters. As well, make the unit smaller, and add a wall charger. Needless to say, I won't be using this unit much because it seems unreliable, but if there is ever an updated version, I may use it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007G51X6C" id="B007G51X6C-review25" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-20:</strong> This is the third one I've owned (first of this brand). Of the three, this one has the smallest battery capacity, but there are a few things that I do like over the other two:1) This one is smaller than the others. Portability, especially when working with portable electronics, is always a plus!2) The price is pretty good for $35. A good price for when you need a quick pickmeup on your battery.3) Charges at 2.1 watts, which can fully charge my phone in about an hour. I've got some wall chargers that have charged it slower.4) The little green cable inside negates the need to carry around an extra cable. Just pull it out and use it right away.That said, there are some negatives to keep in mind:1) Having this basically gives my phone one full charge. After that, this guy is drained. So, while it is smaller than most others, I get the least amount of mileage from it than the others. I price kind of reflects that.2) The little green cable is on a very short leash, so carrying this and a phone is awkward, to say the least. There is a USB out option as well if you have a longer cable that negates this problem. Still, I'd rather have a short green cable than no cable at all.3) I wish it would sit flatter. Right now, it is nearly cube shaped. so it doesn't fit in my pocket or store conveniently at all.I'm still leaving the rating at 5-stars.

Overall it's not a bad deal based on the specs, it has enough power to more than fully charge a modern smart phone, it can charge two things at once, and you don't need to bring a micro USB cable. My complaints are that it's a clunky shape, it would be more ergonomic if it was half and tall and twice as wide/long for a more phone shaped end product... Also the rubber flap that protects the USB ports feels more annoying than whatever protection it offers me... I'd also really like one of these battery packs come with a built in self-charging plug or at least a slide out USB plug so you don't need to bring any cables. Finally, while it may not be the most well rounded battery pack and not tight pocket friendly, it's certainly capable of giving you more power then pretty much any other pack in it's price range and that alone makes it worth considering.PROS:+ Lots of capacity+ Two devices at once+ Pass through charging+ Built in micro USB cableCONS:- Odd shape- Annoying cover- No built in charging cable/plug for the battery itself</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007G51X6C" id="B007G51X6C-review27" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-31:</strong> This Lithium-Ion power charger works great, when I first opened this it was 70% charged (best for storage) so charged it up before using.

The capacity is a tad small, but decent.  However, I see why other reviewers have complained that theirs broke -- the rubber flap on the end of the battery covers the charging ports isn't hinged very well. So I really gotta peel back that flap to get it out of the way of those ports.  This repeated motion of prying back to open, and then squishing it all back to close, will most definitely result in a short lifespan for that rubbery flap.  Same is true for the additional micro-usb arm -- that rubbery design just won't last and will stretch out over time.  Personally, I don't care if the flap itself breaks. Sure, it protects the ports, but it adds nothing to the function of this battery. The rubbery arm, however, is another story; if it breaks, it takes out a charging port with it.  The blocky design of the battery itself makes this a little bulky in the pocket.  But I do like the hidden green accents that appear when the flaps are opened. It looks classy, but doesn't seem durable.  Time will tell.

The pack will only start charging the phone when it is close to fully charged, if it is being charged itself.However, the unit itself has some flaws that prevent me from giving it a higher rating :- The cable and rubber flap that protects the ports is hard to replace properly. The cable is also rather short.- The built-in cable will not recharge my Nexus 7 (2013 version). Using a micro USB cable with the battery's USB pack works fine.- The battery indicator LED is horribly inaccurate. Once, after fully charging my phone, it still shows 4 lights (full capacity).

It's light and elegant, with a charge cable equipped with a velcro wrap to keep things neat and tidy.  When you get this unit, it comes charged.  Depress the status button, and you will see those 4 green lights pictured on the unit. It promises up to 10 hours of extended charge. Use it to charge your electronics, and you will lose 2 green lights (or what appears to be half the unit's ability to charge) immediately.  But it does charge.  It fully charged a Kindle Fire HD from 12% to 100% in 5 hours.  If you try to recharge the UPPLANT2-T, it will take 5 hours.  The minute you connect anything to this unit, it appears to lose half the charge.Which means you don't always know what you've got.  The charge cord doesn't give you a lot of confidence that your Tylt UPPLANT2-T is giving your 'up to 10 hours.'  But it offers more charge time than anything this size, weight and configuration has any right to do.So why the 3 stars?  This unit has some of the worst documentation I have ever seen anywhere.  There is no clear warranty or apparent way to get redress should it be needed.  Worst of all, in its elegance, this unit is so tightly constructed it was challenging to find out how to use it.

The second time, (25% again) it had the same, but couldn't charge my wifes phone fully. The LEDs are almost random in their indication of leftover charge. I found them almost useless. It's nice to have at my sons ball games, when I need to charge my phone, ipod, etc. Would I buy it again?

However, at over $50 for 5200 mAh of battery life, it's not a good bargain when compared to others.The battery life is decent - you'll get about 2.5x smartphone charges and about half of an iPad charge. You'll be able to charge two devices at the same time, which is rather nice. I charged an iPhone and a Blackberry from the battery pack at the same time and still had a little bit of juice to spare. There's no AC adapter so you'll be charging this off your computer via the included Micro-USB cable.Overall, the battery pack does what it says and matches up with the performance. However, when looking at the price, there are a vast number of battery packs with the same capacity for $20 cheaper. Even battery packs with double the capacity are less than the Tylt Upplant2-T. This pack, in its defense, it a great looking device, but I'd rather have an ugly battery pack if it was cheaper.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007G51X6C" id="B007G51X6C-review42" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-04:</strong> I've charged my iPhone a few times with the Tylt Upplant2-t without any issues.

I've only had it a couple of weeks right now.I got this and the duracell powermat at the same time. I didn't realize the powermat charger did not come with the mat, so I ended up with two similar items and I like this better. If you were going to invest in the powermat system, it might be easier, but you get a lot less charging for your $ because of the clever powermat design.So, why only four stars? In a word, quality and workmanship ;-)  First, let me say it works great.  I plugged my Note 3 in with 73% charge and watched it recharge at just better than 1% per minute. So in fifteen minutes I had a fully charged phone again.  About an hour and a half to charge from 0-100 in my limited testing on a Note 3.  That seemed pretty good to me.  I'm guessing a battery with more mah (like 10,000 or 15,000) might have a higher amp rate and charge faster, but this felt good to me.The device is relatively small, chunky and nice looking.  The button, leds and connectors all make sense and work well. It closes up into a nice box once you are done.That is where the star comes off though, the rubber connector links don't fit snugly and the cover doesn't ever feel like it is on SNUGLY. This thing could easily be waterproof with a little more attention to detail here. How cool would it be if you could accidentally wash it in your pants without ruining it?  I think a tiny bit of quality improvement could make this a reality.Overall, this is a really good charger at a really good price.  You can probably get about 1 & 1/3 to 2 charges depending on your device.  I would gladly recommend this.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007G51X6C" id="B007G51X6C-review44" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-17:</strong> The Upplant2 is a hit or miss product for me.  The only one of my gadgets it seems to reliably charge is my old Kindle.  It refused to charge my Motorola exercise tracker or my Asus Transformer tablet.  After it failed at charging either of these items, I didn't feel comfortable trying it on my phone.  I did try it on my old Kindle though and it worked well and was reliable.Charging the Upplant itself was easy. The Upplant's LEDs indicate how much power is left.  The Upplant feels well built.  It is heavy and feels sturdy.  It's small enough to be thrown into a suitcase. Given the build quality, I was very disappointed that the performance was poor.  It seems as though the Tylt put effort into creating the bones of this product, but it's not as much into its functionality.Unfortunately, I really can't recommend this product.

It does charge an average smartphone from fully discharged state to full battery charge may be 1 and half times maximum before dying out. It can also charge bigger iPad 3/4 tablet or 10 inch Samsung tablets too from zero to about 40% charge capacity before dying out which is not too bad in emergency situations.The Tylt Powerplant came fully charged (When you press the button all the 4 LED lights up) But as soon as you start using the powerplant, the LED lights starts acting up. It drops from 4 LEDs (Full power) to about 2 LEDs in less than 5 mins. After that it shows 1 LED when you press the button. It does keep charging despite this LED display weirdness till the Powerplant's battery is really dead.Now comes the problem. Tylt powerplant does not come with its own charger, So you will have to use your own, for example using it to charge from a USB port on your PC. Well that's where I ran into issues. I used the included charging cable and attempted it to charge on a regular PC port and nothing happened. No lights, nothing. I started to investigate the issue and found that the device was attempting to draw too much current exceeding 500mA so my PC's USB port would shutdown. So I attempted it on a 1A car cigarette lighter port based USB charger and that too had issues wherein it would detect overload and shutdown.I started to believe that Tylt Powerplant was dead, But I still could not convince myself how a perfectly working electronics can go from fully working to completely 'dead short' by merely discharging completely to an attach device which it was designed for and go dead? - Hmmm... fishy & Quirky indeed. Thanks to many other 2.1A or higher USB chargers and DC-to-DC converters that are lying around in my house I started to attempt to kick start this Tylt Powerplant one by one after about 2-3 attempts it came back to life finally using Kindle Fire USB charger (Which is 2.1A) wherein the Green LED started to blink indicating that it is charging the internal battery. It took almost 6-7 hours before the Green LEDs powered off indicating a full charge.This lead me to conclude that if you ever fully discharge the Tylt Powerplant as intended the charging circuit draws too much initial current to recharge the internal battery thereby overloading a regular USB port & some low powered USB chargers. You need to connect to a 2.1A or higher USB powered charger to rejuvenate the device back to normal. This also explains why some people has commented that it stops working after few months of use.Moral of the story - Do not fully discharge your Tylt Powerplant. The other reason for my 2 star rating is the price. IMHO, There are better alternatives out there.Thanks for reading my review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007G51X6C" id="B007G51X6C-review47" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-07:</strong> This is a good idea it's just too darn bulky for any real world applications.  Carrying it around would be a hassle (business people with briefcases and the like would be the exception and perhaps students with backpacks).  The micro usb connection is a good idea but weirdly done with a short rubberized arm that bends in any angle but if you're charging your phone and want to use it you're going to have a large black ear ring hanging off your phone that weighs too much to ignore!. It can charge two devices at once as long as one of them uses a micro usb port.  The indicator lights are misleading and whimsically offer an unrealistic estimate of how much power is actually left in the thing at any given moment.  It says power gone come back later and it'll say two lights worth left...that sort of thing.  All that said it does do what it says.  It charged my phone from almost dead to full in about the same time the wall charger takes.  Yesterday it charged my Acer Iconia and my phone (albeit taking a much longer time) and still had a little power left.  So it works..it's just bulky and there are slimmer smaller just as efficient units out there if you look.  The Energizer XP8000AB comes to mind as an example.  This costs less tho and does function well so if bulky doesn't bother you you're good to go.  I've had none of the problems outlined in some of the other reviews.

There are a few positive things about this device. It does have the ability to charge two devices at once. It has a  built-in micro USB charger. As far as negatives, this portable battery is much heavier and bulkier than other brands that I have. Length wise, it's about the length of my palm, but it is rather thick. It's size does not make it difficult to just throw in my pocket without looking ridiculous. It is also rather heavy compared to my other back up battery. It took a little while to charge up the first time. The built-in micro usb is convenient, but it is kind of hard to get the plug into my phone due to my case on my phone. It  has a light indicator to show how much battery you have left. Charging up my smartphone used 3/4 lights worth of the battery. So I doubt that even if you were charging two devices at the same time, that you would be able to get them both fully charged (unless they are low drain devices).

(don't you just hate seeing a review start out that way?  I wish another direction would have worked better here, but in the end, that seemed the most effective way to go so off I went and here we go...)First up, I would note this device fits into a category with other similar devices, such as aTylt ENERGI2-T Energi for Micro USB Devices(which is slightly mis-named/described, as it will also charge devices that would require other types of USB connections), and another device that I had bought ages ago from {now} Amazon subsidiary, Woot.  That device would be theEnergizer XP2000 Universal Rechargeable Power Pack(or similar).  There's also an alternative from Duracell, theDuracell Powermat GoPower Overnighter Batterywhich I also recently reviewed (and liked, except for the packaging that seems designed to lock that device into permanently ;) )Personally, I tend to favor the Energizer gadget of the bunch as I like that it came with an assortment of accessories including assorted charging tips, a carrying bag, additional cables, and more.  It was priced (at the time I ordered it) in the neighborhood of the pricing for this device, which, as I look around, was a bargain.This device (the TYLT UPPLANT2-T) promises the ability to charge two devices at the same time, but does so while confusing the user with battery status indicators that don't necessarily relate back to reality.  After charging a device for a bit, the lights may go out in a fashion that would lead you to believe more of the charging capacity of this device has been consumed than really has.  Leave the device sit for a while and come back and attempt to use it and the indicators may show that more battery life remains than was indicated when you stopped charging earlier.  Basically the charge indicators don't reflect a 1 to 1 relationship between the capacity that remains and how much you see on these lights.Charging this device may also be a bit problematic.  If you aren't working with a 2.1A charger, you would probably be well advised to switch to one.  Otherwise this device may not charge well or nearly as quickly as you might desire.It is OK for what it was designed for, and compared to current pricing on the Energizer XP8000 that I love so much, it is fairly inexpensive.  I'm thankful that I was able to try this device out, but don't know that I could recommend running out to buy one too quickly.  I would say that if it was to include a separate charger that easily plugged into A/C power (like it's little cousin, theTylt ENERGI2-Tdoes, even if it wasn't using a flip out plug as that one does), it would probably be a better deal.One last thought here, this is a device that considerably thicker than the Energizer XP8000 and, obviously, its own cousin, theTylt ENERGI2-T Energi for Micro USB Devices.  That may make it harder to find room for in your own carrying cases.  That is again certainly an area where the smaller units prove to be a better solution.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007G51X6C" id="B007G51X6C-review54" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-01:</strong> The Tylt powerplant is a nice little portable charger for those on the go. It has 1 USB port and an integrated microUSB cord. It can be charged using your computer's USB port with the included cable. If you want to use your car or the wall, you will need to invest in a USB adapter for those outlets, or use one that you may already own.The Good:It's compact and essentially fool proof. If you can plug in a USB cable, you're golden.Charging is at least as fast as your wall charger.Battery capacity is larger than your average cellphone's so you can get multiple charges.LED indicators to let you know what the battery's level is at.Charge two devices simultaneously as long as one uses a microUSB.The Not-so-Good:Heavy. It's a battery so it does have some heft to it. May not be comfortable to carry around in your purse or shoulderbagYes, it charges two devices simultaniously, but one HAS to be a micro USB. May dissuade Apple users from the purchase.Attached microUSB cable is very short, it would be very uncomfortable to attempt to talk on the phone while using the device as you would have a 2 pound battery hanging off it. This may also inhibit the use of other devices while charging as well.Overall:It's a solid product. I noticed that other reviewers voiced complaints regarding the longevity of the device. I have only owned the device for a week, so I cannot speak to that factor. I have experienced no issues with the device and it works straight out of the box, exactly as it is advertised. My only real concern is that there's a limited market. I rarely find myself without a car charger (much cheaper than this device) or a USB port nearby. I think if you do a lot of camping or hiking, it'd be great to have. Most people probably won't find it's infrequent application worth the price tag.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007G51X6C" id="B007G51X6C-review55" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-07:</strong> The Tylt Powerplant is a USB/microUSB charger made for recharging portable devices on the go. It has a lot of nice features, such as a compact design, built-in swing-out micro-USB charger arm that will connect with any micro-USB device, eliminating the need for a separate micro-USB cable, and a second regular sized USB port for plugging in a USB cable for other products that use a USB-connected cable (30-pin or lightening cable for iProducts, for example). A rubberized cover snaps into place to cover the connectors when they are not in use. It has an LED green light indicator on it so you can quickly check the power level. With the quick push of a small, black button, the LED lights will light up (0-4), letting you know how much charge is left in the device. Recharging the product is done through an AC/USB adapter (NOT included) and a micro-USB cable (included). The charger came 3/4 full and charged to 100% in less than 10 minutes.In terms of charging capacity, the product description claims it can charge two devices simultaneously. It has a 5200mAh capacity, 2.1A output (roughly 10W). Based on the mAh capacity, it should be able to charge a iPhone 3-4 times.  With my iPhone at 40%, it was able to charge it to 100% in less than an hour (maybe a lot less-I didn't check), but only dropped one power level (from 4 to 3 lights). However, when my son used it to charge up his iPhone that was completely dead, it used 3/4 of the total charge.  He did leave it plugged in all day, so it might have continuously drained it throughout the day.  Charging a Samsung Galaxy, it drained the battery by about 50%, and was able to charge my iPod Touch completely with the remaining charge and still wasn't completely drained. **I think it is safe to say you will be able to get two full Smartphone charges out of one full battery.**I am not sure the LED power level display works.  At one point after a brief charge, the LED indicator read 3 lights (75% full). However, after sitting for a few minutes, it mysteriously read 4 lights (fully charged), without being recharged.One design flaw is the rubberized port cover. After a few weeks of pretty consistent use, I have been having trouble getting the cover to stay closed. I keep the battery in my work bag in case I need it on the go (it is light-weight and compact enough to carry around with me), but I have noticed that the ports are starting to get dusty inside. Even if I am able to get the cover sort-of closed, the edges still pop open, meaning the ports will eventually get dirty. I don't know if it is that big of a deal, but it is just a note. The micro-USB arm also isn't staying as secure in its little area either, so I do worry that it may get stretched out if it gets jammed between two items in my bag. I will need to keep it in a side pocket or something to keep it safe. Maybe if it came with a carrying case of some sort, it would be better than the rubberized cover?Another minor point is that it didn't come with an AC adapter. I have tons, but another adapter is a little extra that is always good to have around.Thus, I give the Tylt Powerplant 4 stars. It appears to charge as well as other battery chargers I have used, but the minor design flaws and possible LED power level indicator issues take it from 5 to 4 stars.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007G51X6C" id="B007G51X6C-review56" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-04:</strong> The integrated plug is a little strange, almost like a rubber arm, but I was able to plug it into my phone without removing the phone case.  If it did not fit, I do have the option of using the standard output, which some chargers in this price range lack.  It does not have a wall charger, I do not get this, since charging from a high powered wall charger speeds up the charging time.I was able to charge my Nexus 4 from 10% to 95% and then again from 15% to 75% while the phone had WIFI off and was in Airplane mode.  You can charge two things at once, (I did this with a Sansa Clip and the Nexus 4) but it slowed down the charging speed.I like the rubber cover, as it means junk is less likely to get into it when I throw it in my electronics bag.  I uploaded a photo of it next to a soda can for size.The green lights that show you how much charge you have left go off a second after you turn the device on.  This is annoying as you cannot see how much power is left.  However, since the lights are not actually a great representation of how much charge is left, this may be just an annoyance.With a high power wall charger (2.1A) it took 6 hours to charge from one green light back up to four.  I did not take it down to zero (and that means you have to keep an eye on it and keep checking it by pushing the button) since a lot of lithium ion batteries have trouble if you drop them down to zero.The sticker will not peel off nicely.  I hate that.I really like the idea of a backup charger, but the reality is that with a car charger the times I will use this the most is during air travel.  It is too large and heavy to carry around all the time in my purse.

It's a bit clunky and brick-like so it's not one of my more favorite to lug around.  The shape just does not fit that well in my purse.  But when I want the most power, this is the one that I reach for.  It has a LED power indicators, which is good.  Then on one end, it has a rubber door that flips open.  It has an attached micro-usb cable that is very short and therefore, not very versatile.  Then it has a USB port so you can charge anything else you want.  Personally, I would have just preferred 2 USB ports, that would provide the most versatility.  It seems to hold it's charge well when not in use and charges well.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007G51X6C" id="B007G51X6C-review58" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-02:</strong> This is similar to the various other portable/mobile charging units I have.  The unit is fairly bulky compared to others, but it is rechargeable and can charge more than 1 item.  My main issue is that it does not charge quickly, is fairly touchy to get it charged correctly, and it doesnt stay charged long.I expect my backup &#34;emergency charger&#34; to actually stay charged for a long period of time; I do NOT want another item I have to keep charged up all the time.I have several mobile devices and occasionally need to charge them before they day is up, so I keep a backup battery charger.  This one has a battery life that requires you to keep a charger handy, so whats the point?  I have gone back to my old standy which is powered by AAA batteries, so I dont need to worry about keeping it constantly charged.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007G51X6C" id="B007G51X6C-review59" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-26:</strong> My iPad was down to about 18% charge two hours ago. I plugged in this backup and have been working steadily for the past few hours and am up to 44% charge on the iPad. The TYLT did not come with a cable, I used the original one form the iPad. There is a built in plug to charge an iPhone at the same time. Very handy for the multitaskers in the family. I like the design of the built in plug, very sleek, compact and useful. The LED light button did light up right out of the box after holding it down for a few seconds I saw one bar. Now after 2 hours of charge time there are no more bars and my iPad charge seemed to stop at 43%. I'll have to go plug it into my PC, something I would prefer not to do. It would be so much easier to recharge in a wall socket , as I do not travel with the desktop PC.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B007G51X6C', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B007G51X6C', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00ATUHDDI</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00ATUHDDI</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00ATUHDDI" id="B00ATUHDDI-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-20:</strong> This is the replacement cords for the Iphone 4 and they are 10 ft long and they work great for the office and dont havce to sit close to the power outlet.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00ATUHDDI" id="B00ATUHDDI-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-18:</strong> This charger only charged my ipad 3 for half an hour and after that that was it it wouldn't charge it anymore.

If I had six thumbs, I would put 5 1/2 up just because you scared me with an arrival date so far into the future.Product - This cord length is awesome! The factory iPhone cord feels like it is two inches long and if I want to turn over in bed or anything that even remotely differs from basically sitting on an outlet, you better think again. Lets face it, you feel the same way because if you didn't, you wouldn't be here looking at this awesome cord.Anyway, I saw this and was like... Hmm. Should I buy this? Do I really need 10' of cord for my phone? The answer was clear. Yes, I need 10' of sweet freedom. 10' excessive? Yes, a little, but I have found that I have used all 10' a few times! I am very happy with this purchase. I have cords for days. Cords on cords on cords. Sweet.You should buy this if you want to taste that sweet freedom, also. I recommend it.Almost forgot about one con: when I plugged in my phone the cord didn't work, however, I shut my phone off and then plugged it in again and works awesome! Remember the on/off phone trick or you will be mildly irateUPDATE!!!! 08/21/2013This is broken already. The cord ripped out of the thing that plugs into my phone.

In fact, it's not unheard of that I usually use my smartphone more than my personal computer. Why? It's just easier. Recently, I had to make a change and move some outlets around. The standard chargers that are sold with an iPhone are not long enough to actually use it while it is charging. When I'm streaming a show via HuluPlus, or using it for personal business, etc., I want to be able to use it, comfortably, without having to stay close to the wall outlet. Not only is this cord long enough, but I can keep it plugged in while I'm watching a show, turn it off, and wake up in the morning with a phone that's still charged. Free yourself from the annoyance of chargers that really just aren't long enough! This charger isn't too thick, and fits perfectly into my phone (even with a thick iPhone case) effortlessly. I might buy one more for my iPod.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00ATUHDDI" id="B00ATUHDDI-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-20:</strong> The item was as described and arrived on time without any problems!

Cruzerlite generally makes a good product, in my experience, but this skin seems to be an exception. The skin itself is quite thick, and since the back piece and the side pieces are separate it is very easy to accidentally start peeling off the back and side pieces. At this point I'm only using the back cover, the side pieces were peeling off almost immediately. The packaging was good, the delivery was very fast and the product itself was nice.

There really is no easy way to perfectly align the back on a Nexus 5 other than just taking the extra time and lining it up.  I cut out the camera with a razor and lined everything up that way. Then taped the top half securely in place. Lifted the bottom half and starting at the center laid the bottom half down. This would be much more easily accomplished if there was a split in the backing from Cruzerlite.The reason I didn't give this a 5 has nothing to do with the installation. I only wanted to put a back on my Nexus. I wasn't sure the color so I ordered a few. I took my time and insured everything was lined up perfectly. In each case, there was a tiny amount which went over the edge and I trimmed off with a razor. If I was installing the entire skin, this may not have been an issue, I wasn't installing the entire skin so it was an issue.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00H9OAQIG" id="B00H9OAQIG-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-22:</strong> QUALITY is key to this skin! its amazing and it gives the phone a whole new look !

I have had a few skins for my Nexus 5 and this one fits and feels really well. The cut outs are spot on and each side piece fits perfectly around the edges. I did have to use a hair dryer to smooth out the corners a bit but that is to be expected.I like the texture of the skin; kind of like a lizard skin if you will. The color however isn't close to the render that we see here on Amazon or Cruzerlite.com. It is more of a light green or if you want to compare the color to a fruit - Avocado,  and not lime green. Yes monitors can differ from one another and can cause it to look different, however, my monitors are calibrated.The skin will protect the phone from scratches and scrapes and it makes the phone more to your style. It is made with 3M vinyl and it is fairly thick which helped with the instillation. I tried a Florescent Red from Cruzerlite and that skin was very thin and was hard to get on correctly. Not sure if all of the Florescent skins are thin like the one I had.Pros-Easy InstillationGreat FitProtects from ScratchesPriceLook and FeelExtra Fronts and Sides just in case you mess up some how.Cons-Color is a bit off from the render.If you are looking for a skin that is priced well from a company that has great customer service and other great products for your phone this is the one to buy!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00H9OAQIG', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00H9OAQIG', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B003ZFL308</h2>    <p class="price"> $B003ZFL308</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003ZFL308" id="B003ZFL308-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-06-20:</strong> I really liked it so much and it is working fine with me knowing that I am a heavy user to my Blackberry Torch mobile phone and I ordered it once more for my wife.I recommend it to any Blackberry Torch users, I think its better than the original.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003ZFL308" id="B003ZFL308-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-09:</strong> Haven't had to use the new battery yet, hope it is in working order when I do.

I would have preferred the item that I could use on my desk but given some of the poor reviews of that model, I may just keep this model is it does not feel light or cheaply made. The light is a rather obnoxious blue LED but it is not a deal breaker. I have only had this a few hours but so far, it seems to be working fine. Mine also came with anew FS1 battery.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003ZFL308" id="B003ZFL308-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-23:</strong> Yes, I would recommend this product.

I bought these expecting cheap and poor quality, given the price it would have been foolish for me to expect any better quality. However, I purchased these based off of previous experience with chargers of the same quality. Three of the ten didn't work. At least in the batch I got. Now, I was not expecting these to last a lifetime or even a long time by any means, but I usually can get a month or two out of each.I did contact the seller though, and they did make it right. It makes for a neutral experience on these. I would still recommend if you are just simply looking for something cheap that you don't need to last for longer than a couple months.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009R6MB96" id="B009R6MB96-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-08:</strong> Its ok i like how its clear but there is no way to turn off lights, so at night while im sleeping its flashing</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009R6MB96" id="B009R6MB96-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-28:</strong> Fits easily, Charge came up really fast.

Since I've heard so much good things about Google operating system I wanted to buy another phone and try it out. I first bought Motorola XT720 with Android 2.1 but realized that the SD memory with over 7gb couldn't be used when downloading apps from Google market!? So I ran out of memory after using up only few thousand megabytes of the phone memory.  There were other flaws such as not being able to create Yahoo email accounts for quick viewing of all the email accounts with out loging in and loging out with each email. Whereas iPhone you can have Gmails and Yahoo mails accounts and I have over 15 email accounts in which you can see it all at once.  I returned the Motorola and got my Mytouch 4g just two days ago and so far I'm loving it!  I say so far because who knows what will pop up after playing with it for awhile like I did with the Motorola.  Anyway, I checked the user reviews for this phone prior to purchasing and that the consensus was that it is a good phone but has couple of complaints such as speaker volume.  Sure enough, after trying it out, the speaker is really poor compared to the Motorola I had. The Motorola had dual speakers and this Mytouch only has one so when you're in a semi-loud environment you really can't hear too well even the volume is up all the way. Another complaint was the face to face video calling but I haven't used it yet and I'm not that much concern about it since not too many people have that capability on their phones so I don't need that feature at this time.  Otherwise, everthing else seems to work just fine.  I love the camera with flash and the video recording comes with flash light so you can record in the dark! I will continue to update if I see anything else I need to mention as I get used to using this phone more.Edit: December 13th, 2010I've been using this phone now for little less than a month and I'm changing my opinion from loving it to just liking it.  The things I really like about this phone so far are that what I mentioned before, camera and apps from Google.  Also, this phone does allow you to create more than one email accounts from both Yahoo and Gmails.  So I'm able to see it all at once since I have over 15 email accounts. It is, however, not as good as my iPhone 3G.  It seems to be much slower in retrieveing all the emails compared to my iphone and it's not clear cut looking either.  Ok here's the one MAJOR reason that I had to drop the star rating from 4 to 3 stars on this phone, and that is the battery life is ridiculously WEAK!  I thought my iPhone 3g was weak but it still isn't that bad compared to Mytouch 4G!  It is a pet-peeve of mine with a weak battery life on any phones, the CNET review says 4 to 5 hours of talking time but I really didn't even come close to using it that much.  I tried using the battery saver apps such as killer apps and juice saver apps but none helped at all!  I barely use it for no more than an hour of talking then did some internet surfing for couple of hours and my battery had drained more than 40%???  This is after fully charged!  So now I have to charge this phone about twice a day if not more!  I don't know if it's the battery that might be defected or not but it's a brand new phone and battery and I'm not about to go and spend another $40 for a new battery to see if it's defected or not.  Another flaw detection is that when I am sending some old photos from my laptop to my emails so that I could downloaded to this phone's gallery but it wouldn't do it???!!! I never thought this would be an issue?  This phone doesn't have a selection of which to download into the gallery format!  So the photos are just stuck there in the format under the email I sent and if I need to view it, I have to open that email and view it from there.  This is a major problem for me.  I will keep this phone and will be purchasing iPhone 5G when it comes out next year.Edit: 12/18/10Previously I complained that there was no selection in downloading the pictures from the email to the gallery on the phone and that is still true.  However, about couple of days later I found that the photos were there in the gallery??!!  It took about few days before it actually got into the gallery?  There obviously is some sort of delay effect.  I'm happy that it did get to be downloaded into the gallery but it's annoying still to think that it took so long for it to do it.  Strange.  This is definitely a bug with this phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004BNM86Q" id="B004BNM86Q-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-14:</strong> I am very surprised at the MT4G for it's ease of using, understanding and its performance.

It comes with 768mb, but user losed 150mb due to this act by carriers.

With its unusual shape and variety of colors to choose from, there is sure a match for everyone.It arrived enclosed in a reusable cool hard plastic storage cup.  It was extremely easy to pair with my iPhone 5S and did not require a pin or code.  The included instructions come in several different languages and have a brief summary of how to pair and use the speaker.  Controlling the volume and answering calls are all done via your phone.  The only controls the speakers has is an on/off switch and the outputs for the charging and auxiliary port.  The speaker has two very small LED lights to show the charge and Bluetooth status.Besides using it in Bluetooth mode you can also connect via an auxiliary cable.  Connect your laptops, tablets, MP3 players or anything that has an headphone jack.With so many Bluetooth speakers out in the market today it can be a difficult job to pick one.  The biggest factors to me are audio and visual appeal.  The Modre has got my attention with its stylish good looks, amazingly crystal clear sound and ability to fill a modest size room like a bedroom, kitchen or office with great sound.  The bottom of the speaker has a rubberized ring to keep it from sliding around.Solidly built and has one year warranty.Sample provided for review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EJCTFI8" id="B00EJCTFI8-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-06:</strong> Sound is good, buuuuuuut Had some Bluetooth connectivity issues.

Since one of my speakers came damaged they promptly send me a refund and my new order was sent in less than 2 days - Great!Now about the speaker:This little speaker has good quality and the sound is loud and enjoyable. They are ease to pair, the battery is long lasting, and they are really small so you can bring it with you everywhere you go.Having different brands of Bluetooth speaker under $100 I can classify them in following order:1) Braven 570  - The best sound in the list, open and clear with tight bass and soft treble, the mids are clear and very smooth. You have volume controls, hands free and a USB port to charge your phone in an emergency. Since the controls are in the right side of the speaker you have to get the speaker in your hands to use them. The Bluetooth range is great (30 feet). Price: around $100.2) LePow's Modre -  Good sound, lack a bit of treble and bass, is very portable and has good construction. The only control available is the on/off at the speaker's bottom, you have to use your phone for volume and start hands free. The Bluetooth range is great (30 feet).  Price: around $ 30.3) GoGroove BlueSYNC SRC - The sound is ok, but a little harsh in the treble and lacks some bass.  Easy to pair, the controls works flawless and they are positioned on the speaker top, so they are very easy to access and to use. Price: around $304) Pyle PWPBT60 - The sound is ok, a lot of bass, but the mids and trebles are muffled. Lacks certain openness to the sound. They are sturdy, heavy, but have the worst Bluetooth connection. The connection drops all the time when someone or something is placed between the speaker and the phone, very annoying. The Bluetooth range is very limited. Price: around $70If you want a good sounding speaker that you can carry with you everywhere and don't want spend a lot of money, LePow's is the way to go. They come in a nice pack (a nice cup) with nice cables, they have a great design, very good construction.

Most are OK, but usually leave me wanting more. More bass, more clarity, more battery life, etc. Finally, I've found one with the perfect combination of everything! This Modre is stylish, sounds great, connects easy, and comes in great packaging. And, as an added bonus, the packaging doubles as a bass-booster. As I was listening to the Modre at my desk and admiring the plastic coffee-sippy cup it came in, on a whim I put the speaker back into it's packaging and it made the already good bass response even deeper. Ultimately, this is a solid, well-made product in a sea of mediocrity and yet it's priced very competitively, which makes it a winner in my book.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EJCTFI8" id="B00EJCTFI8-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-29:</strong> This thing is great!  I had a large Sony speaker for my desk at work.  It was big and took up a lot of room, not to mention it wasn't Bluetooth.  It cost me $100 a few years ago.  It was time to upgrade.  This thing runs forever on a single charge!  I have had this for a few months.  I use it for hours on end at work almost everyday and have only charged it a handful of times.  It is so convenient to put some music on and just move the speaker to a far corner of the desk completely out of way.  Not only it this thing super small but it goes pretty loud.  The highs and lows aren't bad at all.  I would recommend this for to use at work on a desk, in a garage, kitchen, etc.  LOVE IT!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EJCTFI8" id="B00EJCTFI8-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-10:</strong> A person that works for me showed their Logitech speaker and I had to have a Bluetooth speaker for myself. I was, however, not in the mood to spend $100 and so after reading the reviews and succumbing to the ridiculous cuteness of the Lepow I placed the order.

The presentation of this speaker is just great. First of all, it comes not in a box but in a cup. The cup is about 6 inches tall and has a silicone cover that matches the color of the speaker inside.When you open it, you get the speaker, a small instruction sheet, a USB cable and a 3.5mm audio cable. I received this speaker for review purposes.Bluetooth connection is a cinch. I didn't even have to read the instructions. I just turned on the power at the bottom and my smart phone found it right away. Once powered on, the sound is amazing. This speaker is only about 3.5 inches tall but the sound coming from it belies its size. This is one of the few times where form and function come together. I'm really impressed by this speaker and highly recommend it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EJCTFI8" id="B00EJCTFI8-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-26:</strong> From the reviews I read I was expecting a little more quality sound.  Sure I don't expect this thing to compete with Bose or anything but I have bought less expensive speakers that sounded much better.  After reading the reviews of people who swear by how good this thing is...I have to say I'm not very pleased with it.  I really wanted to like it, when I opened the box I was very happy until I listened to it.  Maybe I have a defective unit.UpdateShortly after receiving this speaker I was asked via email from Lepow about the item.  I shared this review with them and they immediately apologized for my dissatisfaction and offered to send another speaker.  I was so impressed with this kind of customer service that I had to raise my review to 4 stars.  I listened to the new speaker as well.  I still feel the bass could be a little better but I did find a little trick.  If you keep it in the cup it came in it does seem to enhance the sound a little.  These are very quality made speakers which you will notice right away.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EJCTFI8" id="B00EJCTFI8-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-13:</strong> Using it in my office at work, the sound great for a mono-speaker setup, but good, not issue, and can go up really high.

So I started looking for speakers, specifically bluetooth speakers.  This speaker produces a nice clear sound, although its size restricts it from producing any measureable bass. Volume is enough to fill a room and is clear even at the highest volume.  This unit paired easily and does not lose connection to the device. My first unit had issues with the bluetooth dropping if you just waved your hand in between the devices.  I contacted Lepow and they shipped me a new one immediately.  They have excellent customer service and I would not hesitate recommending this product to friends and family.  The new Modre does not lose connection and I can make it about 25ish feet without issue.  I havent had the device on long enough to drain the battery as I normally play it while at work at lower volumes and then charge it overnight.  It easily has played 6 hours without losing any quality whatsoever. I love the shape and size of the speaker and it makes a great portable speaker. I chose the green color and its a really great color. I know alot of people love the packaging but for me a normal/smaller carrying bag/case would of been preferred.Some things I am not fond of are that the unit does not have physical buttons to change the volume, or to answer calls.  If you use the speaker during a phone call, people on the other end have issues hearing you unless you speak very loud.  They also say it sounds as though you are in a tunnel.  I didnt buy this speaker for talking on the phone, but since its a selling point, I thought I had to comment on it as well.I have a few other brands of bluetooth speakers coming in, so be sure to check my other reviews in the next week or two.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EJCTFI8" id="B00EJCTFI8-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-25:</strong> This is a cool little bluetooth speaker, and the sound will not disappoint.

I like this speaker; it charges quickly, was easy to pair with our phones, plays great sound, and each charge lasts a long time. Very recommended.The Lepow Modre is much more than just a speaker as we were not only able to listen to great music, but we could use it as a speakerphone to handle incoming calls... all through the mic on the speaker's base! Very cool - well worth purchasing. The unit comes in multiple colors and the one we received was green. It came with a USB power cord that we plugged in to our Samsung phone's wall adapter, and the speaker fully charged in about 1.5 hours as indicated by the red charging light going out.The excellent instructions made it easy to pair with our phones, and pairing was quick and trouble-free with the speaker's voice prompt letting you know when pairing starts ("Pairing") and also when it is completed ("Pairing Completed"). That was a nice touch.  The phone paired with the speaker was always within three to 12 feet of the speaker, typically one to eight feet away, with relatively good line of sight between the two devices. At no time did we experience distortion or loss of volume due to those distances.Tested with my Samsung Galaxy S3 and our teenage son's HTC Droid DNA, the first thing that we noticed was how well this speaker responded to the equalizers on those phones. The DNA has Dre Beats audio on-board, and man-o-man did this speaker rock with that program! When placed on the counter or tabletop, the impact on bass volume and resonance was outstanding.If you would like to see pictures of the speaker that I took, please go back to the speaker's main sales page, scroll down to where the "Most Helpful Customer Reviews" section starts, and look to the right of that area for the "Product Images From Customers" section. It really is a neat looking and great sounding device.We played an eclectic selection including Linkin Park, Everlast, Bob Marley and even a little B.B. King, from sources including Amazon's MP3 Cloud, Pandora and our own audio files. The results were outstanding; with a little tweaking from the equalizers for the different mixes of music, we coaxed the Lepow Modre speaker into producing superb sound for several hours. If I didn't have to concentrate to write this review, I would still be listening to the great tunes right this moment.While enjoying the music, we tested the inbound call capabilities and were impressed by the sound quality of the mic and the speaker during the call. I took a walk outside and placed a call to my son's phone; he answered the call and then spoke with me via the speaker -- and then we switched. Perfect device to use as an impromptu speakerphone!How many times have you purchased electronics and found that the user manual is just worthless? NOT the case here; the manual that comes with this speaker is well written and easy to follow, and has versions in more languages than I have ever seen come with such a device. Glad to see that time and care was put into creating a useful, well written guide.The speaker's retail carton, aka the cup, seems to be a novelty; thought maybe turning it upside down and placing the speaker on top of it would allow some special acoustic properties to shine through... but nope, the speaker sounds best when place on solid furniture.The User manual notes that there is a one year limited manufacturer's warranty, so if an issue arises before that period expires I will return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. I did receive this speaker gratis from the manufacturer, and have put it through the paces to objectively find out how well it performed. My statements here reflect that testing.If you are looking for a speaker of this style, size and functionality, for use similar to what I have described above, then we highly recommend the Lepow Modre to you. Neat, funky, fun, easy to use, great sounds... really a nice unit.Go for it and enjoy.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EJCTFI8" id="B00EJCTFI8-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-05:</strong> This Lepow Bluetooth speaker has a somewhat quirky design and comes in quirky packaging, too.

However, I prefer the sound quality of the Philips SoundShooter over this device.- Portions of the instructions are in broken English, but it is fairly easy to figure out how to use this device</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EJCTFI8" id="B00EJCTFI8-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-05:</strong> The first thing you notice about the Modre when you open the shipping box is the... odd packaging. It's quirky. It's fun. And highly unique.The Modre comes shipped in a travel style "cup." It's not really a travel mug as the rubber lid has no opening for liquid, but you can remove the sticker from the cup and all the packaging, give it a good wash and have a perfectly usable cup to go with your Modre. This kind of solution is quite brilliant in my mind, as if the person who receives the Modre keeps the cup, that's kept some worthless packing material out of the land fill or recycle bin. Of course, it will eventually need to be tossed, but in a few years I would hope, meaning you really are making a small difference.Anyway, the packing is brilliant. Hands down.The other things that stands out to me is the design of the speaker. I've tried out many... way too many... Bluetooth speakers. Each sounds OK and each has some unique design cue to it. The Modre is the first that seems to be designed with the thought of true 360 degree music. I can confirm, by dancing around the speaker as it blares my music that the experience is, pretty much, the same in front as it is from behind the speaker.The performance itself is about what I've come to expect from a BT speaker. It sounds OK. It's not audiophile quality, and if that's what you are looking for in this price range you are deluding yourself for sure (it won't happen). Instead, if you lower your standards a tiny bit, you can jump into the Modre and enjoy truly portable, easily portable as the weight is minimal, BT audio from your speakers.It also includes a mic so that you can use the Modre as a speaker phone. My only complaint is that there are no controls on the device to answer the phone or change volume. That's a minor complaint given the performance and fun level.I used BT, which was simple to connect to my Lumia 1020 and my iPhone (don't ask why I have 2 phones). I also plugged the speaker into my computer using the line out. Sound is good out of the box. If you want a deeper bass experience, or tighter treble, plug the speaker into your computer or connect it via BT to your computer and use a program, such as J River Media Center, that allows you to do custom EQ. After EQ the sound is quite good. And no, I don't expect EQ capability on a portable speaker at this price, just pointing out that a little EQ can go a long way.Overall:I am quite happy with the Modre. The packaging is silly, quirky and fun. This is the first time I've mentioned PACKAGING in a speaker review for a BT speaker.Performance, for the price, is quite nice. With a little EQ, you get a great sound but unfortunately not all phones off that kind of capability.With the ability to plug the included 2.5mm plug into a device that doesn't have BT support, you can still enjoy the sound from the Modre and your chosen device.Highly recommended.I received a free sample from the manufacturer for review purposes.  I would NOT hesitate to spend money on a Lepow product.

It feels cheaply built and gives the expectation that after a dozen or so uses it'll probably break (I've only used it a couple of times so far).  It also provides a somewhat tenuous grasp on the 808, which is a relatively bulky phone.Use of it takes some care; to avoid pushing buttons, you have to place it in a very specific area between the slider for the screen unlock and the shutter button; in this spot it obstructs the slider so you want to unlock the screen first, then try to install the phone in the mount without touching the screen.  It doesn't give a confidence-inspiring grip, so use with caution.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007P5DO2Y" id="B007P5DO2Y-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-28:</strong> Item received as described.Even though the image sample shows a Blue Lumia not the 808 PureView, the HH-23 Tripod Mount DOES HOLD the 808 PureView!

We all know that GPS drains our phones at a rapid rate, so having the extra fully charged battery gives me peace of mind that I will have enough power to make a phone call if needed after the round.  The stand is coonvenient to use on your night stand if you use your phone as an alarm clock, it will stand securely vertically or horizontally. However the one con I can think of is that it doesn't have the ability to charge your phone while docked on the stand.  It would've been perfect if you could wake up to a fully charged phone and extra battery while in the stand.  The only way I've figured out how to charge both batteries at the same time is to have one battery charging in the charger/stand, and then have the phone in the stand either horizontal or upside down so that your original travel charger can still be plugged into the phone over night.  Still, I reccommend this for anyone who may have long days on the weekends(during the weekdays I just keep plugged into my computer at work so it is always fully charged).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B005LBEIEW', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B005LBEIEW', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00EF1OGOG</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00EF1OGOG</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EF1OGOG" id="B00EF1OGOG-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-22:</strong> This is such an upgrade from the previous generation.

It does the job well get at least one full charge for both phones. The design is great love the feel and the little pouch that comes with it. One huge caveat for me; I cannot stand the fact that the shake to reveal battery level feature is so easily activated. I mean this thing would come on inside my backpack or in my pocket while I was on the move. Its so annoying and I can't help but feel like I am definitely loosing some power when this gets activated. Seriously just walking with this thing it would light up and show me the battery level all the time. I find this incredibly aggravating and if and when I am in the market to buy another battery I would not buy another Anker external battery with this feature. This was my concern when I bought this battery and I should have listened to my first instinct.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EF1OGOG" id="B00EF1OGOG-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-28:</strong> I had to return this battery for one reason: it doesn't support pass-through charging (AKA passive charging).

I need this feature because I'll be using my USB battery pack as a cache battery between my bicycle's dynamo hub and my smartphone.

Too Gimmicky. Lack of design function, too much form consideration. Bit higher efficiencyAs I mentioned in my 9000mAh review for this pack, my ideal battery pack is as follows:1) Lightweight2) Economically priced3) Small footprintAnything additional addon or design to the battery back is impractical.  It serves more of a distraction than usefulness.  Plus as consumers, we will pay more to have these &#34;features&#34; that we do not need.Features (2/10):This goes the same for this 6000mAh pack.  We want functional features on our products, not gimmicky features.The Shake to Wake function serves more a gimmick than any practical useFirstly so call shake requires a considerable force.  Not many people will be willing to throw their arms frantically to get this awake. Can get this slipped out from your hand and there goes your battery. Consider I have both 9000mAh and 6000mAh, it's not a coincidence shake to wake problem is just a one off.Since the shake function is gimmicky and serves zero practically, it's simple to say we are paying more money for useless feature while having motors inside to make the battery pack weight more.Performance (8/10):Here is where it's better than the 9000mAh function with a slightly higher, but still subpar inefficency.Performance is still less at what a regular external battery does.There's a simple math formula to calculate power conversion.In my one week of trial, I'm able to get 1.5 recharge on my Galaxy S3 which is 2100mAh.  This means in actual fact this is 3300mAh after efficiency conversionThe Wh claimed here is 6A*3.7V=22.2Wh22.2Wh/5V (5V from USB) = 44.4A*1000=4440mAh is the expected Wh without circuit board inefficiency for a 6000mAh battery pack3300mAh (from actual use) / 6600mAH = 0.7524 equals to 75.24% power conversion efficiency through their circuit board.  Average total energy conversion rate (TECR) on average circuit board is rated at 80-85% from reputable brands.This equals to around 5-10% less energy efficient than your typical reputable brand with the same battery they are using.  This is better than the 9000mAh battery pack but still off from the usual standardAs mentioned previously, 3 problems can cause issue:1) cheap battery used2) cheap board design causing inefficiency3) cheap material used on circuit board reducing TECRWith multi cell design batteries, it's easy to slip in an occasionally lower rating batteries while having another one at full capacity.  It's negligible to some people but over the years, the amount of battery capacity you lost do build up.  Imagine using this 500 times, losing 10% of 500 time is still 50 times lost charge that shouldn't have occurred in the first place.Cheap board design occurs when manufacturer uses poorly made board or power inefficient chips.  This caused lose of energy and greatly reduce the TECR as I mentioned earlierPrice (2/10):Again, this is not cheap for its performance result. Some brand carry a 6000mAh battery as low as 17 dollars.  At literally more than double the price than other comparable brands, this manufacturer is making a massive margin and justify adding more cost by:1) putting gimmick features on board2) possibly using mediocre battery cells3) possibly using cheap material or poor board designWith more cheaper alternatives out there with higher efficiency.  With more choices out there, it's hard to find reason to pay this much for a battery packDesign(3/10):I will say the same for this battery as I did with the 9000mAh. The overall aesthetic of the battery is nice to look but lacks practicality.  People need to note that for backup battery pack, function is far more important than how it looks.  Concept of design requires a good balance between function and form with polarized products such as a backup battery pack, it requires much more function over form.In the case where you will hold this backup battery with your phone or tablet, the rounded surface leaves your phone or tablet unstably settled.  As a product of support, it is unfortunately not supportive at all.That itself is a design failure and lack of consideration to real user experience.Conclusion (2/10)We probably want something more practical, more functional when it comes to higher price..  Aesthetic is great on some products but as far as a real support product is concerned, this battery pack, again, has too much glitter and glamour but none of the practical stuff you really need.  It's a support device for your phone and it is the phone where the glitter and glamour should be. However, it's not acting like a support device at all with its subpar performance and its rounded surface.Honestly a flat design will work much better to hold this along with the phone but most likely it will be better to sit in somewhere you don't require it to be stationary.  If you find my review useful, please vote Yes.

The items exterior is glossy and smooth to the touch. It is a little heavy but then it's a 6000 mAh battery pack so that was expected.  The small form factor of the battery pack was suprizing though. It is small engough to fit in the size of your hand which makes it extremely portable (pockets, purses, etc).  I do really like the features of the battery back, battery level LED divided into 10 sections that shows the current power left, smart USB port and the shake to turn on feature.Items in the box:* The Anker 2nd Gen Astro 6000 mAh battery* Instruction manual* 12in USB charging cable* Carrying bag to protect the powerbank* Compatibility to use your own cable for chargingFeatures:*USB Smart port (will detect the device and charge at max output for the device)*Shake to turn it on and see battery level*To charge just plug into an outlet or computer USB port* LED battery level display showing either 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 10% and 0%*About 80% charged when you recieve itCon:The serial number is on the cable itself versus the powerbank.

I would recommend this to anyone who wants the latest tech gadget out there.  As of now this is the most feature rich powerbank that I have seen and own. The Smart USB port is also really useful as some devices only charge at 1A and some at 2A.  The Smart USB port allows you to use the same port to charge both 1A and 2A devices and at the max current allowed. Great for having a backup plan to charge your portable device on the go.I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation in order to provide a fair and honest review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EF1OGOG" id="B00EF1OGOG-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-06:</strong> this looks a very good quality equipment but the light that shows the level of the battery is very anoying. even if you leave the unit alone over the desk, any breath of air or sound the light turns on. it misses a set of cables.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EF1OGOG" id="B00EF1OGOG-review19" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-08:</strong> I like this product so far.

This unit I have tried on my Samsung Galaxy phone and on my Samsung Galaxy Player. Since I carry around a tablet and a phone, what I do is charge one and get it fully charged and then place the other into this so that each one stays charged and ready to go. Note that this comes with two USB charging cables, neck strap, hand strap, and excellent instruction manual.  Below you will see my testing results and suggestions:+ My Testing Results on Charger: Each device charged up VERY QUICKLY from 50 percent to 100 percent in just 1.5 hours! Therefore you can purchase that is full confidence because it has a FULL 2amps, which is just what most newer tablets require for the fastest charge! And it also benefits newer and larger phones (such as the S4) because it charges just about as fast as their wall connection counterparts!+ My Testing Results on Flashlight &#8211; To fully test this, I went into a very large and totally dark closet and turned on the flashlight part. WOW! Everything in the closet as vivid. Then I went outside in a dark area of my yard, shined the flashlight and I could see very well, in fact just as well as my big and bulky regular flashlight (now retires)!+ Do you need a high powered portable charger with a flashlight (but just need one port)? Then I will suggest this to you as it will charge your tablet or phone very fast. However, there is ONE port. If you are looking for one like this WITH 2 PORTS with 2 amp, with a flashlight also, then I suggest to you the EasyAcc Power Bank 9000 (which I also own and have reviewed). The Anker Power Bank 9000 has dual ports for your tablet and for your phone and also a Flashlight! (For me, I take both with me now because I need a port to charge my Bluetooth headset).Very highly recommend this totally portable charger to ALL!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EF1OGOG" id="B00EF1OGOG-review24" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-04:</strong> Overall this is a great product and I am very happy with it.

I have purchased many things from Anker before and so far with one exception, everything has been great. The one exception, Anker replaced with almost no questions asked.The good:- The matte finish and it's general look. It is very sleek looking and has a lighted circle to indicate how much power is left in the device.- It charges an iPhone 5s about two or three times, depending on what the current battery level of the device is. I'm not one of those people who counts the minutes it takes to charge a device, but it seemed reasonably fast to me.- NO FLASHLIGHT! Honestly, what's with all of the companies that think these things need flashlights! No worries about accidentally turning it on and wasting power.- Comes with a USB cable for charging.- The Price. The price was pretty good for this device considering it's quality when compared to devices of similar quality. Anker also has deals if you are buying more than one of their chargers so you can save some money there too.The bad:- The matte finish. Yes, good and bad. Seems pretty easy to scratch. But as long as the device works I don't really care about that.- The charging cable is a tad short, but who doesn't have a million of these cables around?All in all, good mobile charger for a good price.

The design of this product is well thought out and I like the shake feature, which shows you either how much battery was left on the charger or initiates the charging process.  The Anker 2nd Gen Astro is fairly lightweight and can easily be stowed away in a jacket or pants pocket.  The included draw string bag helps keep the cable and charger together pretty nicely too.I own a Nexus 4, and the battery on my phone is not all that impressive when a day requires heavy use.  This Anker charger helps in a pinch, though I was expecting a little more juice at 6000mAh, I almost got 2 full charges out of it (with 10% battery left on the N4).

Everybody makes one. But no one makes one this "sexy". It's designed to provide portable power that meets the needs of today's high draw electronics, and still be a great tactile and visual experience. It's sized to fit in a pocket or a bag without taking up more room than your phone. No switch to worry about, just a shake and the segmented charging indicator shows the power left. And it pulses when actively charging. No need to hide this one, it works and looks great.On the practical side, my old Galaxy S 2 has a 1800 mAh battery and I get 4+ charges from the battery. However, I use this mostly to keep the phone working (radios off, of course) on plane trips. I fly 4-6 legs per week, and use the phone for video, audio, etc. This keeps the phone fully charged and ready for use when I get to an airport. I've also used this as a power source for a Lenovo Tablet, Nook Color, Jawbone, and JamBox with excellent results.Anker has great customer support, product quality, and an 18 month warranty. It also comes with a short micro USB cable for recharging battery and charging compatible devices. Also included is a sturdy bag made of netting and a locking drawstring.

I had bought Anker batteries before for mobile phones, but never saw them for much more than a good OEM replacement. They have since grown to an excellent company with awesome products.I bought this for my wife, I was going to get her the smaller 3000mAh version, but she's really into Ingress now so battery life is a must), all of them awesome products. I would definitely recommend any and all Anker products :)Charged my wife's Galaxy SIII from about 15% to 100% in a little under over two hours while playing Ingress. Exactly what the doctor ordered. Well worth the extra 10 dlls from the 3000mAh unit. This is a sexy little unit, no buttons, smooth surface. The LED gives it a nice look and the color makes it extra nice for the ladies who don't like plain black devices (or guys, I'm just too damned plain myself).Also got the dual port 4.8A car adapter from Anker, we loved it!

It also means you get about 10% more charge than other 6000mAh External Batteries.-VERY compact. In my video review, I compare it to a 5200mAh Battery and you can see this Anker is slight smaller.-Material is awesome, a very smooth matte finish-Overall clean designCons:None!Neutral:-USB Cable that comes with it is very short, and it doesn't have any other adapter with it (only Micro USB)-The &#34;shake to charge&#34; features works about 90% of the time, but I'd like to see a physical button to activate it.-Only 1 USB port. I'd love to see 2 USB Ports on a battery this size.Wrap Up:I'd definitely recommend this battery, and it will be great for any device, of any size.

I like the incremental led light in the front and the fact that there are no buttons you simply pick it up and it turns on and lights up to display the charge.  It is compact enough to fit in your pocket so you could charge your phone on the go easily.  I charged my phone up to full and the leds did not even go to halfway so i know this thing is raited as it claims.  It also charges pretty fast.  I noticed after a long charge it does not get hot or even warm to the touch.  My cheap external battery i have gets burning hot.So all in all i would consider it a great product.  It seems smaller than comparable 6000mah battery packs.  I like the fact it is able to detect the product you are trying to charge and bump up to the amperage automatically such as phone vs a tablet.If you are looking for a portable battery this is THE ONE to get.  Stop looking at other ones and brands.

Well, it depends. If you have a protective case like an Otter, replacing the battery might be difficult and time consuming. This spare charger is really fast and easy. Of course if you have a phone with a sealed battery, you won't have another option but a portable charger. Lastly, if you have a phone that has battery change access and you use a holster without a case, a spare battery is probably a better option.When I need a charger, a battery for a cell phone I always buy Anker. The quality of their products is always excellent and while I have never needed their service, their reputation is second to none. You could order an OEM battery and end up with a counterfeit or another brand that won't work right out of the box. I prefer Anker, you get what you pay for. This charger is excellent, buy without any concern whatsoever. Highly recommended.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EF1OGOG" id="B00EF1OGOG-review55" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-22:</strong> Beautifully designed and functional.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EF1OGOG" id="B00EF1OGOG-review56" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-07:</strong> So far not good, I have used it til the Battery died on 3 different iPhone 5s recharges, now that the battery is Dead it hasn't recharged since.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EF1OGOG" id="B00EF1OGOG-review57" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-05:</strong> Easy to carry and can charge my phone twice on a single charge.

Sure, Sony offers their own charger.This little charger, on the other hand, fits the bill quite nicely too.  I'm nearly able to get 2x additional full charges out of this for my Vita which means nearly 15 hours of total gameplay (assuming that you were fully charged to begin with).  This is pretty handy on long drives where chargeable ports within a vehicle are at a premium when you're competing with cell phones to boot.The indicator is another handy feature.  Each tick on the indicator is equivalent to 10% of charge so you can readily tell how much charge you have left on your battery.I've used this handy battery on 3 vacation trips and it has served me well.  I'm sure it works well for cell phones, too, but as a PS Vita user, I'm VERY satisfied.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EF1OGOG" id="B00EF1OGOG-review62" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-18:</strong> Product exterior -Main Unit - overall the finish has a great feel to it.  A very smooth soft plastic that might show some smudges from skin oils if you look really hard but easy to clean off.  It has a good weight to it considering it fits in the hand very comfortably.  The ends are very glossy and while the end with the usb ports (input and smart) is perfectly clean, the other side with the imprint saying 'Made in China, model number' was a tiny bit scratched up but nothing really noticeable.  It does say over here that input is 1A and output is 2A.  Ironically the serial number is not listed on this side at all or on the unit.  ****The serial number is actually on a the short charging cable.  ***Important, for warranty purposes do not remove this sticker..... I admit that I don't like this because usually any large stickers on cables I usually cut off, and also because the serial number should be on the unit itself rather than just the microusb cable.Microusb Cable - The microusb is a very good quality 1ft charging cable.  Some people might prefer longer but fortunately it has the high-quality shielded ends that Samsung OEM Cables have.  There is a plastic covering over the ends protecting the finish that you can peel off.Carrying Pouch - an interesting sports-like carrying pouch that is double layered and has a closing elastic mechanism.  The microusb cable does fit inside with unit while pouch is closed.Description of use - Very easy to install.  I simply connected the microusb input on unit to an Anker 2A USB charger (1A or higher is great).  I found it was like 80% charged and it charged up to 100% fairly quickly.  It works very simply and great.  There is no need for a long charging cable and finding an outlet, this solution works even better and is very portable.  I still have not yet tested it on iPhones or the newest Samsung Galaxy Tablets but it does it work perfectly with Galaxy S4 and other Android phones.  The unit does not need to be shaken to start charging, it simply starts when plugged in.  While charging it does constantly blink the light on and out every second which can get annoying but does at least update its amount of battery left.  The white ring is divided up into 10 leds.  With unit disconnected simply shaking it shows you the charge level.So far it charges roughly 0.6% per minute on a Galaxy S4.  According to 'Galaxy Charging Current' it shows 1900mAh and after a little while drops down to 1200mAh (it does this on stock too).  I still need to do more tests though for accuracy and will update later.UPDATE! 2013-10-19 I have now confirmed that it charges at 0.9% per minute on Galaxy S4 at 2A.  So it takes between 90 to 120 minutes to fully charge the phone.  The last 10% charges more slowly.  I did the test from 1% to 93% in about 96 minutes with minimal usage of screen.  Also after using a 100% charged Anker 2nd Gen Astro 6000mAh, I unfortunately was left with 40% battery on that unit so enough for almost two charges on a Galaxy S4.Ideal users - I recommend these Portable External Batteries to anyone with a smartphone with non-removable batteries.  With an iPhone I'd expect to the user to get 4 Full Charges with this unit.  With a Galaxy S4 about 2 Full Charges.  I recommend getting a higher capacity if you are going on a bigger trip and need more than 10 full charges without recharging the unit.Overall outstanding item and I'm very impressedI was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EF1OGOG" id="B00EF1OGOG-review63" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-06:</strong> small in size, light, fast enough, fits in pocket, and does the job nicely.

Lucky for us we were right there and were able to unplug everything and it didn't spread to anything else. The charging cord that came with it was stuck in the device and broke off when we tried to unplug it. We tried a different wall adapter and cord to charge the Anker device and left it to charge overnight. After taking it to work the next day, he said it wasn't holding a charge and after turning it on the first time, it was already at half power. He was able to use his usual phone cord to charge this phone using the Anker charger, but it did not charge it the full 2-3 times that they claimed it would. We are now returning it.

It seems to do better when plugged into an external battery source rather than the wall unit, so that's what I've been doing over the past year or do.I had a RavPower 5600 that worked well, but died unexpectedly a few weeks ago. This Anker is its replacement, and wow what a great upgrade from the RavPower!I love the clean design and ease of use, but the best thing about this battery is how fast it charges, and then how fast it charges the Kindle. Plugged into the wall, the Kindle could take up to 8 hours to go from depleted to fully charged. The RavPower cut the time to maybe 6.5 hours. The Anker Astro charges the Kindle in as little as 4 hours (from 15% to 100%).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EF1OGOG" id="B00EF1OGOG-review75" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-10:</strong> I was always running out of power on my Iphone5 when I was not at a place I could charge it so this handy little guy was just the ticket for me.

It's small enough to easily carry in a pocket or bag, and so far I have been able to fully charge my iPhone 4s twice on one charge. My only complaint would be that you must use your own phone cable with the USB plug to attach your phone to the battery. It comes with a mini USB to USB cord to plug into the wall using your own USB charger when it needs to be charged. That means I must carry both cords with me. I sometimes forget to bring my charging cord, and then it's worthless. In the past, my other external batteries did not have this issue. Otherwise, it's a great battery and I'm always happy I have the extra power. It took a while, but now I remember to throw both cords in my messenger bag when I take off for the day.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EF1OGOG" id="B00EF1OGOG-review78" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-08:</strong> Used to be when I'd travel by plane, I'd bring a book, a stack of magazines, a large bottle of water and of course, I able to wear shoes with laces. Obviously, there's a new world order and traveling means I have to stay in touch with everyone at all times! Besides hauling my Mac Book, I now bring my iPhone, iPad, slide on shoes and because of TSA restrictions, no water bottle.I'm not phased by dehydration. Like most travelers, my fear of all fears, is that my electronics will lose their power, while in midair! I get the shakes at being left with no phone to tell my family, friends and colleagues that I'm waiting on a line or bored. I also shudder at having no books, magazines or emails from work to read. After all, without any power, I am a broken man - dehydrated, staring at my slip ons.I'd heard that external batteries were an option but thought they were expensive, bulky and not dependable. After hearing my son Alex rave about his battery pack, I decided to read some independent reviews and take a cyber stroll to Amazon. Review after review highlighted Anker's superb quality, reliability and features. However, my foremost reason for going with Anker was their excellent  customer service. I noticed that if in fact there was a negative review, Anker remedied each and every malady. As a result of my research, I decided to order the Anker, 2nd Gen Astro, 6000mAh Portable Charger (2A Output) for $29.99, at Amazon.Looks: In about two days, I received the Anker, 2nd Gen Astro and the biggest surprise was how small the battery was. While I knew this model was portable, I had no idea it would be smaller and  lighter than my iPhone 5. Another feature was the black matte rubber finish which is both good looking and felt solid in my hand. The Anker also came with a handsome padded, nylon-stretchy pouch. The Anker fits nicely in either my briefcase or jacket pocket.Performance: The Anker comes with a micro USB cable and can be charged, via your computer or with a number of plugs that accommodate a USB cord.  The only exception was my iPhone charger. For some odd reason, when I used my iPhone charger, the Anker's light would flash wildly and not take a charge. However, when I used my other electric charger (Non-Apple), the Anker charged beautifully. Out of the box,  the Anker came charged and filled up in about twenty. When completely empty, the Anker charged in about three hours, even though the instructions stated six hours. An LED circle light alerts you to the existing power levels and turns off, when charging is complete. Once charged, the Anker goes into sleep mode and can be turned on with a slight shake. With the Anker fully charged, I went on a tear, charging almost anything in sight! I charged my iPhone 5 (With 9% power remaining), Garmin 410 Forerunner GPS Watch (30% power remaining), iPod Nano (Empty), iPod Shuffle (Couldn't determine the remaining power) and iPad Mini with Retina Display (8% power remaining). The Anker charged up the iPhone, iPod Namo and Garmin 410 without a hitch and each, in about an hour and a half. The only problem was with the iPod Shuffle.  For some odd reason, I seem to believe there are some cable compatibility issues with the shuffle. As for my iPad Mini, the Anker finally ran out of juice.  I would like to add that the charging times are approximations and were not scientifically timed. In my opinion, the charging times were impressive.Regrets: I have to admit, I wholeheartedly recommend  the Anker, 2nd Gen Astro, 6000mAh Portable Charger (2A Output). The charger is inexpensive, good looking, portable, easy to use and will charge your phone, as well as most portable electronics. My only regret is that I didn't purchase the more powerful Anker 2nd Gen Astro2 9000mAh Portable Power Bank Backup External Battery Charger Rapid-Recharge (3A Output) Dual-Port. This bad boy can charge any two electronic devices and only costs $36.99!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EF1OGOG" id="B00EF1OGOG-review79" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-02:</strong> Great product!

They are a life saver when you are on long trips, a heavy user, or away from your charger for a long period of time. So many times this device has saved me from the dreaded dead battery. This battery charges your phone fairly quickly and you can easily get a little over two charges out of it. The cable that comes with it is the perfect length, so you can leave the battery in your pocket while you hold your phone or lay it on your desk.I have had some trouble with them though. I ordered two of these packs and one came completely dead. Anker support reached out to me and was able to exchange for a new one. Their support is great, but this is the second time this has happened to me with these batteries. They're a company that stands by the quality of their product, but I'm just a little weary now though because 2 out of the 4 I've purchased in the past two years have come dead.In short:PROS: Awesome product, awesome support team (if needed), never leave the house without itCONS: 2 out of the 4 I've ordered in the past two years have been duds.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EF1OGOG" id="B00EF1OGOG-review82" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-09:</strong> this is a good product. is a very rapid recharger for on the road.

And then I looked the mophie up and decided that for $100 I'd rather buy and keep an entire spare cellphone on me.I've purchased Anker's replacement laptop batteries before so I figured I would try their portable battery out. The shake to charge feature is very cool, it beats fiddling with buttons on other packs, and I've noticed that simply plugging a device into this will be enough to initiate a charge if your battery isn't already dead. The soft touch finish makes this feel like you paid a lot more than $30 for it, and it comes with a carrying case as well as a microUSB cable.I charge it up using a 2.1A tablet charger, and then it's good for charging my phone fully almost three times. It charged my HTC at &#34;A/C&#34; speed according to the Status menu on the phone, which is a good thing. Not a bad deal at all, and even better when you consider they're using Samsung or similarly high quality battery cells in the device. It's not very large, and fits easily into a camera bag or backpack; if you have more space to spare, you might want to consider their 9000 mAh or larger chargers, they add more capacity and more ports!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EF1OGOG" id="B00EF1OGOG-review85" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-26:</strong> The design and feel of this external battery is beautiful and feels great in the hand.It's a very compact size with enough juice to easily charge my device, the shake feature works well even though I was worried it would wear it the battery, I have seen no evidence of this.Over all the only issue I had was a small bit of solder that was loose in the service which made a rattling sound, this caused no issue and I managed to get it to fall out of the USB slot, other than this one tiny thing the device is awesome.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EF1OGOG" id="B00EF1OGOG-review86" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-29:</strong> this is such a great item - so convenient to have in your purse to recharge my iphone  - no complaints whatsoever - works as expected and what else can I ask for!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EF1OGOG" id="B00EF1OGOG-review87" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-16:</strong> Very few things seem to work right out of the box these days.

All the while, this sleek, 7 ounce battery will fit into your pocket effortlessly. The soft rubber-like material makes gripping the device a breeze. The separate LED indicator lights also provides a more precise telling of the remaining battery power of the unit itself, which fades seamlessly beneath the surface of the battery pack when the unit is in an off state. All available ports are placed on one end of the device, which includes a 5V/1A micro-USB input, as well as a 5V/2A (max) standard USB output charge port that is compatible with an assortment of USB-chargeable electronics.When testing the Astro on its functionality, I connected my iPhone 5S (as well as an assortment of other devices later on) to the battery device with the appropriate charge cable. To activate the battery and let the charging begin, I simply had to shake the battery to activate its charging capability. No buttons necessary.Charging my phone from 10% to full took around an hour or so. I was able to get two charges for my phone from a fully charged battery pack. This is with the phone on, connected, and with apps running in the background.A standard micro-USB was also provided for those who have Android or other compatible devices. No Apple charge cable or adapters were provided, but the original Lightning cable that came with my phone worked just fine.Items in the box includes:-Astro 6000- Instruction manual- A stout micro-USB charge cableFeatures:-6000 mAh battery capacity-Single USB port that detects the connected device and smartly outputs the specific charge rate to ensure there's no overcharging or overheating issues-No AC wall charger was provided with this unit, but it is compatible and will recharge with any standard USB wall charger, including my Apple wall charger-18 month warrantyFor reference, here are some common devices and the amount of mAh of capacity they have when they are fully charged:* iPhone 5 battery 1440 mAh battery capacity* iPhone 5S battery 1560 mAh battery capacity* iPad 2 battery 6,944 mAh battery capacity* iPad 3 battery 11,560 mAh battery capacity* iPad 4th (gen.) battery is 11,486 mAh 3.7 VDC at 42.5 Wh* iPad Mini battery is 4490 mAh at 3.72 VDC 16.7 WhAs noted, you will not be able to fully charge the latest Apple iPad with the Retina display, as this is only a 6000 mAh capacity battery. You must also consider the losses in the charging circuits of both the battery and the device you are charging. When using an external battery, one must take the heat transfer, voltage conversion, and the electronics of your device's charging circuits into consideration. Other contributing factors include running background apps on your smartphone/tablet, as well as its connectivity to Wi-Fi or the LTE networkReal world examples of charging capability with this battery pack:* iPhone 5S approximately 200% of full charges* iPad 2 approximately 57.5% of a full charge* iPad 3 or 4 approximately 34% of a full charge* iPad Mini approximately 80% of a full chargeThis product is solid, functional, and well-designed.

While Astro 3 was very impressive with three outputs and 12000 mAh capacity, it was a relatively large and heavy device, which is expected. Astro 2 shrunk it down to 2 outputs and 9000 mAh capacity with a more pocket friendly footprint. Here with single output Astro and 6000 mAh capacity the size was reduced down to an awesome compact size which you can store even inside of a very small purse. But don't let the small size fool you - you still get all new 2nd gen design with every bell'n'whistle of Astro 2 and 3. So let's take a closer look.Continuing with their environmentally friendly packaging, battery came inside of a neatly packaged box which contained a battery itself, a manual (always very detailed), and accessory box with usb to micro-usb cable and a mesh draw-string storage bag for a battery and a cable.  Now let me tell you about the size of this battery - its is SMALL!!! Weighting around 130g and with a size of 90mm by 45mm and thickness of 25mm - it will easily fit in a palm of your hand where you can make a fist hiding it inside. That's how compact it is. With a new rounded design and smooth edges, the hard plastic shell is lined with a soft touch rubbery finish. You get one micro-usb battery charging port (1A speed to charge the battery itself) and one full usb smart output port for any Android or Apple device. The output supports a maximum charging speed of up to 2A. In my quick test with OEM usb cable I confirmed a charging speed of 1.5A using my Note 2. The speed will obviously vary depending on the cable you use, so keep that in mind and use usb cables with thicker wires.Just like with Astro 2 and 3, this 2nd gen device uses a new 10-segment circle LED indicator to show you the charging progress of the battery or the remaining charge on the battery in increments of 10% thus giving you a higher precision reading. Most of the other batteries usually include 4 LEDs to indicate 25% increments, but with Astro you are getting a better precision. There is no power button anywhere around smooth surface of this battery. To start the charging or to check the remaining capacity you just shake it and display LED comes alive. Also, considering actual capacity of any external battery is typically 30% less then advertised value, in case of 2nd gen Astro a more efficient conversion circuit is used which gives close to 80% efficiency, so you can count on about 4700-4800 mAh of charging power. Considering super compact shape of this battery, this is very impressive and perfect as a portable emergency charge you can take with you anywhere.Overall, the design, the efficiency, the charging speed, and compact size of this battery makes it a very attractive package. It is also very unique and sets it apart from competition. Add to that Anker's 18-month warranty and great support - with introductory price of $29.99 on Amazon this is one fantastic value. I highly recommend it!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EF1OGOG" id="B00EF1OGOG-review98" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-29:</strong> Handsome and well made charging device.

This part did exactly that, but it was one of the most difficult installations I had ever done on an iPhone. It's not so much that the part is tiny...it's the fact that you have to fold the ribbon cables perfectly and make sure it stays in place while getting everything attached. It also didn't help that I was installing this into a non-OEM back casing. That made the fitting just a little bit off. But that was the case, not this part. In fact, I held this part up to the original and it was almost indistinguishable from the original.The 5-star review is because this product works. It was exactly what I needed and it did it's job just fine. If I were rating this on the easy installation, I'd give it zero stars. But, nobody said it would be easy and for anyone who has ever worked on an iPhone, you know this all too well.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004FM6XU0" id="B004FM6XU0-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-01:</strong> My original review is below. However, after 1 month the buttons stopped working and after 2 months the audio jack died. I hate to say it, but if you have an IPhone 3GS it's probably cheaper to buy a new Android or Windows phone instead of trying to fix it.I am a podcast junkie, and I was going crazy because just touching the headphone plug caused my iPhone 3GS to cut in and out (or only play in the left or right earbud). Finally, I had no choice but to buy this cable and do the repair. Warning - installing the cable is pretty complicated. If you have no experience repairing your iPhone you might want to use a repair service instead. However, I have poor eyesight and unsteady hands at it took about 2 (frustrating) hours to install this. Also, you need access to Youtube since I doubt this can be done without watching a repair tutorial.Bottom line is that this item FIXED my headphone jack problem and I am extremely happy about that. Unfortunately, the mute button doesn't work. It is possible that this item was defective, but I suspect that I did not get the mute button aligned correctly in the socket (as I said, installing this cable is difficult). Either way, I don't use the mute button, so I give the item 5-stars.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004FM6XU0" id="B004FM6XU0-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-12-18:</strong> I'm a techie, though not an actual iPhone technician by trade. But man, these things are a bear to install! Give yourself 3 hours and equip yourself with the proper tools--including good lighting and a comfortable pair of tweezers to pick up and hold all the tiny screws... (Unless you happen to be a tiny gnome, with itty-bitty fingers, which would be be a distinct advantage here. Man I wish *I* had a gnome...). Also, head on over to the iFixit site and acquaint yourself thoroughly with the great 3Gs repair guides there. Oh, and I'm so glad I got the one with pre-installed buttons, even if I had to pay a few extra dollars.I got this to fix a shorted power button on my wife's phone: the device screen kept flickering and then it would prompt to be turned off. Unfortunately, the replacement cable only lasted about 5 weeks before the symptoms reappeared. Was my wife too hard on that power button? Was there something wrong with my original repair job? Hmmm... could be? But I took the angle that the part was a lemon, and wrote to the supplier before doing anything else. They very courteously shipped me a new one at no charge--thanks! It is now installed (a little less than 3 hours this time!) and appears to be working fine.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004FM6XU0" id="B004FM6XU0-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-07-07:</strong> This was the 3rd one i ordered and FINALLY it was worth it. the other two (from different maufacturers) we sub par at best, one was broken and had corrosion on it the other had no metal brackets and only adhesive tape that didnt stick. not worth the effort.

And the 125s looked a bit fragile.At least with my BT-3030 it works very well.  It doesn't have a lot of range (40 feet at most line of sight) but that's not my concern.Only downsides are no user replaceable battery and it only charges with USB.  It'd be nice if it doubled as a USB to BT dongle for the PC, but oh well.It's a lot smaller than I thought it'd be.  So small in fact that Jabra should consider making an iPod sleeve with a a120s pocket attached. (are you listening Jabra?)The other minor issue is that when it's fully charged, the power button/indicator LED changes green, but not always.  Sometimes it'll go green after an hour sometimes after 10.I'd recommend this to anyone wanting to use a simple universal BT transmitter.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B000FL4GBI" id="B000FL4GBI-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-04-12:</strong> I use this transmitter on the back of my tv with my Bluetooth headphones.

I did have some problems trying to get this thing to pair, it's looks as if there are no buttons, don't worry, it's there.

It also fits like a glove and is one of the best I've seen in terms of hole alignment.Now for the problem. Obviously a white case will get dirty. However you should be able to clean it and get it back to normal. If you let grime accumulate then it'll stain the case. I've only had the case for a week now. I already cleaned it 3 times over the course of the week. The sides of the case (where you hold the phone the most) has a noticeable dirty tinge to it. If Cruzerlite has a way to clean it then cool.

On the AC site there was a mention of 50% off CruzerLite Case.  I was waiting for my new Galaxy S III to arrive and knew I wanted a sturdy case to start with.  CruzerLite has always earned huge positive reviews.There is only 1 Con.  The holes for the volume and power has thin coverage that covers the screen.  I fear over a brief time it will break.

It's foldable and very lightweight. I can carry it around in my bag without even noticing it's there. It also serves as a good desktop stand when I'm home. My iPod Touch 4g with Speck case sits surprisingly stable on it. It does not tilt over easily like you would expect in a lightweight stand at all. I usually prop it up on a very thick book so it's closer to eye level. Along with my HP Touchpad and Apple Bluetooth keyboard they give me a very productive distraction-free environment. I occasionally use it with my Motorola Atrix 4G with Otterbox case as well as Blackberry Curve 3G, both without a problem.

It was for an ingenious light-weight, foldable, inexpensive solution to most smartphones' lack of a built-in stand (Some HTC phones a sparkling exception). But the construction is defective because the ridge on the base that was supposed to keep the phone from sliding down is rounded and so low that (a) ATT's Galaxy S 3G does not stay up at all, while (b) T-Mobile's Galaxy S 4G, which has a less rounded frame, stays up precariously but after a while it slides down. So I increased the ridge's height with tape and now the phones do stay up but what a non-professional sight.

I love their product, and find it much easier to install and use than Zagg's version.  However, this one left me somewhat dissatisfied.  The protector went on easily enough, but once it dried, it left visible lines and dots over the screen of my Galaxy Nexus.  These do not go away with further smoothing, or over time, as I've experienced in the past.  I followed the directions to a tee, and there is nothing (dust, etc.) under the protector.  It just doesn't work with this screen for some reason.  The lines and dots appear to be in the actual TechSkin, rather than on the phone, or in between the two layers.

I liked the Fantom but 3 weeks later the adhesive began to fail and the Fantom glass started pulling away from the phone glass, so I sent it back for a refund. I went over to the XDA forums and saw that they had a poll going for favorite screen protector and the Skinomi rated pretty highly so for $9 I decided to try it. Wow! All I can say is wow.. it's a wet application, meaning you spray both sides with an included detergent solution and apply it wet. Skinomi provides a very nice hard rubber piece to use to smooth it out, much much better than using a creditcard as other manufacturers would have you do. I applied it, smoothed it out and wiped the excess solution and then let it sit under a small fan for about 12-14 hours. when i came back, it was like glass, almost perfect, you could barely tell that it's there and my screen responsiveness is as good or better than it was!

I carefully followed directions, saturated my fingers with the provided solution, and wet the back of the protector (not excessively). I applied the protector to the phone, slide it into place and then sqeegeed out the fluid and bubbles from the center out to the edges while quickly dabbing the excess fluid with a paper towel.  I then let the phone sit for 24 hours before powering up.The good:- the protector covers the entire glass surface and thus affords maximum protection to the screen;- 99% of the bubbles and imperfections just squeegeed out, the balance disappeared after 24 hours; and- the cost of this protector is very good in comparison to the competition.The bad:- installation is more complicated than experienced with the typical dry application protector;- I had some fear that the excess solution I squeegeed out from under the protector had found its way into the phone's guts and shorted out my new expensive toy.  It hadn't, thankfully, but water and electronics don't mix well so there is some risk in using a product like this;- the protector never became "crystal" clear like a typical dry protector.  Rather, it had a wavey look to it under certain light conditions;- worst of all, when I reinstalled my gell case, the edges of the case lifted the edges of the protector and ruined the effect and utility of the product.  That's not the fault of the Skinomi product, but is an issue that you need to consider  when deciding on the the kind of protector that you want on your screen and the case that you use to protect the rest of the phone.  The dry application protectors that I bought from Verizon don't cover the entire screen and thus don't have this problem because the edge of the gell case rests against the glass, not the protector.  So, depending on the kind of case that you have, this protector may not be your best bet. The irony here is that a major advantage offered by this protector of covering the entire glass surface turned out to be its undoing; and- finally, surrendering my phone for 24 hours while the solution dried was a tough sacrifice to make.Frankly, I don't see that the good outweighs the bad.  The clear protectors sold by Verizon go on in 2 minutes with no bubbles or imperfections (if applied properly), provide adequate protection, work well with gell cases that wrap around the edge of the glass, are crystal clear, and require no down time.  They may cost a few bucks more, but their cost is insignificant in comparison to the value of the device.  I'm not aware of any claim made by the manufacturer that these protectors offer  superior protection to the dry application protectors (aside from covering the entire screen).  So then, why bother?</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005OTKTMQ" id="B005OTKTMQ-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-10:</strong> This product for me works flawlessly, for the half price against the famous brand.

I have always loved the quality and they last virtually forever. They are a pain in the rear to install and the consumer is constantly worried about using water on a phone. After waiting 24-48 hours for the product to dry it is well worth it, normally. This time, like once before (samsung vibrant) the screen protector didnt release the microbubbles properly. I have an unsigtly orange peel effect on the majority of the screen. In all fairness, the screen has a slight curviture and i think that is why the squegee created a slight crease in the middle of the screen. With a product like this, it is hit or miss ususally due to user error. This screen protector covers edge to edge and doesnt allow use for a case. I have used a case on this phone and the screen protector peels off around the edges.

I removed and reapplied it, probably 4 times and used up the applicator spray that shipped with it.After installed, I notice there are tiny "grooves" or gouges in the screen protector from when I accidentally swiped with the side of my finger and caught the protector with my fingernail. When the screen is on, these grooves aren't noticeable, only when the screen is off and when you look at it from an angle. Another way to put it is the screen has an "orange peel" effect now that I have this protector on it. The screen protector also feels softer and adds a bit of resistance when swiping.As far as clarity, when the screen is on, I barely notice the screen protector. I've kept my phone in the same pocket as my keys and the screen still looks good as new.Even though I have more negative comments than positive in this review, I still think this is worth 4 stars because Skinomi is better than the alternatives.

It was over the top. and unneeded.As for the screen protector it is applied wet (you spray your screen with a liquid then apply) you must then wait for it to dry. I did this as directed and found a lot of bubbles, they do slowly go away after a couple of days but one larder bubble (maybe 1/8" by 1/16") never went away. I cannot say if this was the screens fault or mine but I'll assume mine.The screen, like all others I have tried, did make the screen look a little less sharp. But it did protect the screen from scratching and did fir the phone very well.I was happy with the protector. I have since put a zagg invisi shield on my phone. It is applied by a tech in the mall, cost $20 and they will replace it as long as I have the material.  I made the change because they put the screen protector on for me and boy were they good at it.Comparing them both the materials are very similar and both provide the required protection.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005OTKTMQ" id="B005OTKTMQ-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-01-25:</strong> I ordered this Skinomi for my Galaxy Nexus within days of buying the phone, and I ordered the phone the day it came out back in December.  I was amazed that Skinomi already had a skin for my phone.I am very familiar with Skinomi skins as I had one on my last 2 phones and I have recommended (and installed) them on many phones for friends and family.It is important to know that many people who claim that a skin has bubbles under the skin is because they didnt follow proper directions.  There is no possible way that a bubble that appears under a skin can be the fault of the skin itself, it is always, 100% of the time the fault of the installer.If you follow the directions on these skins properly, you will have a perfectly fitting skin every time.  Keep in mind that some bubbles immediately after installation are normal and they WILL work themselves out.  Cheaper, hard plastic skins wont do this.  If there is any bubble after you are done, it will always remain there.Some people criticise Skinomi's because they give your screen a textured look after its done.  They show fingernail presses for quite a while after they're installed.  That is a result of the "gel-like" material that the Skinomi is made out of and is not a fault with your skin.  This look is totally normal, and if you dont like it, don't blame the skin, you just have a preference that differs from how this skin is designed to work.All skins should be a tad bit (1-2mm) smaller than the actual screen of your phone.  If every skin went perfectly to the razors edge of your screen, it would get snagged easily and would start peeling.  I see reviews of people saying the skin is too small.  This is also intentional and is not a defect (unless of course the gap is more than 2mm).The Skinomi skin is as good of a skin as you can buy, for a fraction of the price.  If you follow the directions, or have someone who is experienced in installing skins on a phone do it for you, you will be happy with the results and this skin should last you for the life of your phone.  You wont have to keep replacing it like you have to with other cheap skins.Finally, there is one thing you should be aware of, that has bitten me once on a prior phone.  Because of the gel-like nature of the Skinomi skin, the screen can become slightly "tacky" when it gets warm.  So if you are in the habit of keeping your phone inside your pockets, your body heat may cause the screen to become ever so slightly tacky.  If you also keep money or other pieces of paper in that same pocket, the paper can become stuck to the screen if you leave it in there too long.  It will come off, but it may leave a residue behind that will last for a couple of days.  This is probably the only flaw I can possibly think of with these skins, but again, its due to how they're made, and I dont think that this should detract from all of the other great qualities of this product.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005OTKTMQ" id="B005OTKTMQ-review21" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-14:</strong> Love this screen protector!

I will completely admit that I hate screen protectors and in my experience, they never last, diminish screen clarity, are overpriced, difficult to install properly, and leave me more frustrated than thankful when owning one. That was until I got my hands on this protector. This review is a description of my personal experience but I used many tips and tricks from other reviewers here on Amazon when I bought my protector. I am not trying to steal from their reviews, I am simply describing my experience which involved their tips and tricks.This screen protector goes on wet. I am a lint and bubble making pro in most cases when it comes to applying these screen protectors so,'wet' seemed like the way to go. The wet application of this one makes it almost impossible to screw it up but you need to follow some basic tips.1. Before you even open the box, you should go to YouTube and watched the installation video at least once. I did this before I even bought it. It is only 5 minutes and worth it.2. Make a special time to install your protector. I know, this sounds silly but from other remarks and reviews I read, it seems that some people mess these up when they handle their phones too soon. I started by forwarding my calls to another phone and then I pulled the battery out of my device to prevent accidental powering on. I chose a Friday night for installation because I sleep in a bit on Saturdays and I wanted to ensure the maximum amount of time to settle and dry. Then, make sure you have a clean work area free and clean hands.3. When applying the film, use a lot of the spray. With the battery pulled out of the phone, the non-conductive spray won't hurt the speaker or anything it comes in contact with and it dries without damaging any electronics. Use plenty of spray on your hands, the device, and the film. This makes it easier to install and set up straight. Of all things to think of during the installation, getting it straight is the most important thing!4. I chose to not use the squeegee wedge thing. Unfortunately, this squeegee card has rough edges to it and there are some sharp little bits on there that have been reported to scratch the film. Alternatives you may think of are: a rubber squeegee, rubber spatulas, a driver's license, business cards, or anything non metallic that would make a good squeegie. Windshield wiper? I actually just used my lint free cloth to "rub" the moisture out.5. Once applied, be prepared for the protector to look like poo! Seriously. Just make sure it is straight. When I applied mine, I thought it looked horrible. I remembered reading that it would have some bubbles but they dissapear after a few days. Mine looked like there was "fizz" underneath. To my dismay, the fizz congregated by the next morning and formed half a dozen air pockets (aka, bubbles). I was pretty irked but remembered what I read, it will go away. After another day, they were all gone. Amazing! Be patient, once you are past the initial installation, do not try to re-do it or get rid of the bubbles, they will go away!This protector has proven to be the clearest film I have ever seen. Yes, there is a small amount of orange peel, but that is intentionally there by design and does not affect the viewing of your device. The film is self-healing and will get some bumps and dents and whatnot in it over time. These imperfections cannot be seen from the viewing angle and they "heal" over time. If you happen to encounter a "permanent" wound to your skin, it is backed by a lifetime warranty and Skinomi will send you a brand new skin (sans shipping) in exchange for your damaged one. In other words, you get a lifetime worth of screen protectors.I would reccomend this protector to anyone that asks and I am extremely impressed with both it's clartiy as well as it's quality. Given the warranty, it appears I have paid for my last skin for at least the next two years.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005OTKTMQ" id="B005OTKTMQ-review24" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-09-15:</strong> This is the third wet screen protector that I have tried for my phone. The first was an ArmorSuit which was fine but had a tendency to scratch easily. The second was a Zagg which had significant "orange peel" and seemed to decrease the sensitivity of my screen. I got frustrated with the Zagg and decided to try this brand despite the mediocre reviews. I've been using it for a couple of days and here are my impressions:Pros:-Feels more natural and responsive than some of the competition (Zagg and ArmorSuit)-Virtually no "orange peel" effect (not a huge deal but not really desirable)-Covers the entire screen (cutouts for earpiece, sensors, and camera)-Small bubbles went away quickly and completely-Includes everything you need, including a microfiber cloth and squeegee card-Instructions direct you to an installation video for ultimate clarificationCons:-None really, I guess all these wet screen protectors could stand to be a few bucks cheaperOverall I am very happy with this screen protector. It was no easier or harder to install than the competition, has no "orange peel" effect, feels less evident in everyday use, and the screen remains responsive. No comments yet on long term durability but I'm sure it will be fine. Give this product a try is you are dissatisfied with your current screen protector.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005OTKTMQ" id="B005OTKTMQ-review25" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-27:</strong> Had it on in minutes.

I wish they included a hard plastic squeegee instead of the credit card style.Other:- The shipping was astonishingly slow. It took almost three weeks for the skin to arrive. This wasn't Skinomi's fault though, as USPS lost it. The day I notified Skinomi they immediately sent me another skin, no questions asked.- This skin doesn't match the shape of the screen 100% perfectly, but it's as close as every other brand of skin I've applied (Best Skins Ever, Zagg, etc).I just applied the film and it looks great. I'll update the review in a few days once the skin sets fully.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005OTKTMQ" id="B005OTKTMQ-review27" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-09-21:</strong> great screen cover, fits nicely, comes well packaged with everything required to properly apply the screen protector.

After searching out Amazon for the frontrunners, I was a little shocked to find how few were available on a phone that's been out for almost 2 months now.  Still, I ended up going with the Skinomi Techskin.  I've never used (nor heard of) the brand before, but I have applied decals and racing stripes to numerous cars in the past, so I knew that wet-application techniques were the way to go.  That pretty much made the decision for me.I was quite shocked at how smoothly the installation went.  If you just follow the instructions on the box it arrives in, you really can't mess it up too badly.  The instructions also claimed that micro bubbles would work their way out, but I was extremely shocked at how all of the larger bubbles I couldn't squeegee out managed to disappear.  Within 24 hours the protector was flawless!  The only marks that I could very very lightly see would be a few crease markers where I pressed down too hard when squeegeeing the application fluid out.A few minor notes on installation for those who haven't ever did this before.  First off, do it in your bathroom.  Close the door, steam up the entire room to an almost uncomfortable level, and do not open the door or turn on a fan.  This creates an almost perfectly dust-free environment, as dust will be attracted to the steam, and very little will be left in the air.  Wait until the steam settles and move on.  Second, DO NOT FORGET TO APPLY APPLICATION FLUID TO THE FRONT AS WELL.  This step is extremely important if you want to be able to squeegee the screen down without creasing and scratching the crap out of the front of the protector.  I had to reapply application fluid to the front at least 4-5 times as I continued to squeegee every last bubble out I could see.  If you're afraid of spraying the fluid directly on your phone, just spray it on your finger and rub the fluid on the front manually...works just as well.  Just make sure you don't apply too much pressure on a dry area of the screen or you may crease it.That brings me to my next point.  Yes, the protector is just a little bit softer than others I've used, and if you drug a key across it, you probably would have to buy another one...as it does imprint if pressed rather hard with a sharp object.  HOWEVER, I must stress that the screen would be completely protected, and I wouldn't doubt that ability of this protector to actually keep anything from completely cutting through to the screen.  That is NOT something I could say about other protectors I've had in the past...even protectors who's surface feels harder.  Lastly, I haven't noticed any "rainbow effect" that others have complained of, but who knows...it may be similar to how certain people can see the rainbow effect on a DLP projector/screen and most others can't.Anyhow, quick pros and cons summary for prospect buyers out there:Pros:Wet ApplicationExcellent bubble-removalProtects the actual screen admirablyEasy InstructionsLooks Great when finishedCons:Scratch/crease/impression proneCost more then many othersAs you can see, I have no real problems with this protector.  Yes, it may cost a little more then many others out there, but are people really going to complain about spending a few dollars more on something that will protect an $800 investment?  Me personally, this isn't something I would skimp on.  For only $6 to $8, it's a no-lose situation as far as I'm concerned.  I'll update my review if I notice any problems that's arise.EDIT - 1/21/11 - I've dropped down from 5 stars to 4 stars due to so many imprints starting to form on the surface of the protector.  While the screen does continue to retain it's smooth feel, I've noticed that its starting to feel a little more rubbery, and when pinching to zoom its easy to accidently dig a fingernail into it, thus creating a permanent crease.  While these imperfections are very superficial and on the surface, they still are making the protector look slightly less appealing.  Perhaps a little bit tougher 1st layer might not have been all that bad of an idea afterall.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005OTKTMQ" id="B005OTKTMQ-review29" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-06-12:</strong> Need some careful to glue, because of the wet way of fixing.

I removed the mount from my windshield after a few hours and no residue was left behind, but I would not recommend leaving it mounted in a hot car for days since the plastic of the suction cup may deform.The U-GRIP held my iPhone in place tightly and I was able to use the screen without much problem, however the arms that grip the device make it a bit hard to use the screen right beside them.  The ball and socket joint allows you to move the mount in almost any direction so you can make sure the device is pointing where you want.  You can adjust the width of the mount, and the largest width should accommodate even the largest phone, but some oversized navigation units will probably not fit.All in all... a secure grip that doesn't harm your device.(I received a complimentary sample of this product from the manufacturer in exchange for an unbiased review.)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IX1FLOS" id="B00IX1FLOS-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-06:</strong> This mount has some pluses and minuses. First the pluses:&#62;&#62; The overall build quality is good. It&#8217;s all plastic, but it feels pretty substantial. The ball and socket joint moves smoothly and allows for a good adjustment range.&#62;&#62;  The suction cup worked well. As with any suction cup, you need to have a clean, smooth surface for best results. Wetting the base of the cup with a little water also helps it maintain a good hold. I didn&#8217;t have any problems with it staying stuck even when going over bumps. Same with touching the screen, even with a decent amount of force.&#62;&#62; The arms have padding that help it grip the phone plus avoid scratching the case. Grip strength is good. You can rotate the position from portrait to landscape.But the minuses are pretty significant:&#62;&#62; Adjusting the arms requires you to push in the locking buttons which moves the arm through three stop points. The buttons are small and hard to push. This is not a mount for those with limited hand strength or arthritis. And, even if you have good hand strength, you end up pinching your finger when you push the buttons and pull up.&#62;&#62; There are only three pre-set stop points for the arm. When I put in my phone (Samsung Galaxy) without its case I was able to find a pre-set the was perfect. However, when I had the phone in the case, one pre-set was a little too tight; the next one was too loose. The pre-set notches don&#8217;t give you the ability to fine-tune the grip distance.&#62;&#62; The top grip is spring loaded, but the spring is so firm that when you apply pressure to release it, the arm skips out of the adjustment notch.While it has some merits, a ratchet-type arm adjustment would have been a better design. The three stop adjustment design is limiting and hard to use. It&#8217;s workable, but I can&#8217;t rate it better than average. Three stars.[Sample provided for review]</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IX1FLOS" id="B00IX1FLOS-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-08:</strong> After fully testing this unit in my car and in my home, I am quite impressed with this very well built compact unit! Below I list the PROS and one CON regarding this unit:PROS:+ My HUGE Galaxy 5 player with thick TPU cover (5 inch screen) fit into this tightly, yet securely! My HUGE Samsung Galaxy Grand Duos fit into this even with it's semi thick cover on it! (This needs to be FULLY adjusted and to the largest adjustment by holding down the buttons on the left (both) and pulling out the adjustment section).+ Smaller devices fit well into this adjusting the buttons.+ On the left side of the phone holding part is the clip, you just pull up on the clip to release the phone or GPS.+ The adjustment goes back to the smallest adjustment once you remove say a large device (5 inch screen type).+ This comes with: Extra sticky pad to attach to the bottom of this should you need it. This is a SUPER SUPER sticky pad that you can place on your dash or any area where you need more sticky area and more secure holding power! (For places in your car or home that you need extra holding power)!!!! (I used this on my dash to as it is more secure there now).+ Easily removes from the dash to use on a tabletop. What I did is I placed my Grand in this and because the Grand is so large, the Grand easily stands up on the table. You can also use the lever to hold it securely down on a countertop in kitchen or bath.+ Small and compact - I keep this in a clear ziplock bag in my purse so I can use this in any car I am driving or use it on a counter, and I have even used it on my nightstand as a phone stand and it works well as a regular stand!CONS:Just one con: I had to push BOTH buttons on the right side in adjustments to be able to fit my large phone in this. No problem, I am used to this now!!Provided by Aduro. Happy to recommend this to all!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IX1FLOS" id="B00IX1FLOS-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-15:</strong> I'm talking about the sticky plastic that works as a suction cup and holds this gadget firmly to your dashboard.  I first saw and used this type of sticky plastic with a set of lint rollers:  When the roller filled up with lint, all you had to do was run it under water from the faucet and the &#34;sticky&#34; loses it stickiness and the lint washes off.  After the plastic dries, the stickiness comes back--good as new.  I think it is a great idea to use it on a suction cup--and it works!I struggled at first, playing around with this mount, trying to get a grip on the slider part.  The trick is to remove the gripper part from the base mount so your fingers have a wider range in which to move and manipulate the slider adjustment buttons.  That is simple to do with a few turns of the plastic screw nut.  Then you just pull the gripper section off the ball joint on the base.  Then it is easy-peasy to make adjustments to fit your phone.I disagree with the claim that you can mount your phone into this holder single-handed.  No, definitely not:  The clamp is really tight and you should not fight with it while you are driving.  Set it up before you put the car in gear!The suction plastic is very sticky, which might limit where you can use this:  If you have a tough, thick vinyl dashboard, you should be okay.  If you use it on a thinner material with some give (like leather or wood veneer) you may stretch the material when you try to remove it, or the sticky might rip off some slivers of veneer.  Same might happen with a painted surface.*I received a sample product from Entronik for Aduro.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IX1FLOS" id="B00IX1FLOS-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-22:</strong> I like the flexibility of the U-Grip Slide. The main arm is adjustable to hold mobile devices of various sizes. The adjustment arm uses squeeze clips, which prevent the arm from going outward, but will bump down to the lower catch if the spring clip is pressed down. I've come to push my device upward toward the spring clip, and then swing the bottom out of the grip, so I never need to worry about readjustment.The grip rotates to any orientation I prefer. I chose the blue grip, and the color looks nice, on the interior and exterior of the grip. This dashboard mount uses a strong suction mechanism that holds really well, and it includes a disc of 3M adhesive that would come in handy for an older, weathered dash, if needed. There is a little rubber cup surface with a donut edge that holds on tight with the press of the latch.Whether on the windshield, or on the dash, the angle of the arm offers flexible mounting options that is quite helpful for keeping map routes handy. This is a great way to keep a pocket free, or a phone safe from scrapes and scratches that may be encountered in a console during travel.This is an excellent mount, at an affordable price. I am completely happy with this accessory, and I would recommend this as a convenient phone mounting option.I was provided with a free sample of this product for evaluation and review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IX1FLOS" id="B00IX1FLOS-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-08:</strong> I received a review sample and put it to the test. First, please read and heed Comdet's helpful April 6, 2014 review because some of the limitation cited are valid if you have a phone the size of a Samsung Galaxy Note II or larger. For iPhones or phones of similar size this holder does work well.My test with a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 indicates that not only is this a tight fit, but getting the phone into the jaws of the clamp was an exercise in frustration. Like Comdet mentioned, when I had the clamps at the last adjustment stop, opening the spring loaded jaw further to fit the Note 3 would disengage the jaw from the adjustment stop. If you remember what flypaper is, this cycle of events is akin to unsticking that stuff. The more you tried, the more frustrating it is.On the other hand, an iPhone 5S fit the clamp as though they were designed for each other and this product was transformed from a mechanical demon to an absolute joy to use. Among the reasons why it was a joy with the smaller phones are the protective strips on the sides of the clamp (the blue areas in the photos) that ensure your phone will not be marred or scratched. Another reason why I love this for the smaller phones is the suction cup holds strongly, even on the pebble-grained dashboard in my vehicle. And finally, the ability to swivel the phone to just about any conceivable angle adds a lot of convenience.  Some holders that I have tested were limited in viewing angle, so this one is a step ahead of that group.Bottom line: if you own a phone the size of a Note II or Note 3, look elsewhere because while this one will work, it's too much trouble in my opinion. If you own a smaller phone this one merits five stars and your consideration.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00IX1FLOS', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00IX1FLOS', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00B4J97LY</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00B4J97LY</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00B4J97LY" id="B00B4J97LY-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-12:</strong> After applying the guard I found that it looks different than most screen guards. The only way I can describe it is a matte finish as opposed to the smooth or gel like consistency of other screen guards. I assume the different look and feel is part of the anti-glare feature which doesn't really make a huge difference functionally, but does cut the glare.It feels more dry so my fingers are also less likely to &#34;grip&#34; and interrupt my swipe. Other screen guards keep me from using anything other than the pad of my finger, but this one allows for any skin surface to operate the touch screen.So are I am well-pleased and application was easier than any of my recent experiences with screen guards.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00B4J97LY" id="B00B4J97LY-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-11:</strong> At this price I was not sure what I would get but I was pleasantly surprised .

I put mine on in about 1 minute with the included squeegee and had only 2 tiny bubbles at the edges of the guard. It does cut down on glare.There are major problems though. The first is that the guard causes a weird "rainbow effect" to appear on the screen. I'm not sure of the science behind it, but I suspect that the anti-glare coating causes light to scatter, which leads to the appearance of red and green spots, especially against white backgrounds. Also, it is very sticky, making it hard to use the swipe-keyboard, or play games that use a swiping motion.If the anti-glare is very important to you, this may be a good purchase, but if you're only interested in scratch protection, buy a regular guard without the anti-glare.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00B4J97LY" id="B00B4J97LY-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-07:</strong> I WENT THROUGH ALL 3 TO TRY AND GET IT TO STICK CORRECTLY.

Cut outs allow adequate access to controls (even improving the ease of hitting the power button.Cons: The case is definitely difficult to open until it loosens up. This is actually a good thing in some ways as I've never worried about the case breaking open, but for battery swappers, this should be a consideration. After a few months of use, this problem goes away.As for why I have purchased two, there is a design flaw: the part of the case between the kickstand and USB port is, by necessity, very thin. After a year and half of use, this strip cracked open. I eventually had to replace the case.

No instructions came with mine.  :-/</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007URUXU8" id="B007URUXU8-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-03:</strong> Got this so that I only needed one plug.

The back scratches VERY easily. I was trying to clean it with a wet paper towel, but it left scratches ALL over. I ended up having to put clear nail polish on the back.2. The green is not the same as in the picture. In actuality, it is a bright, lime green.3. Bumper is getting dirty already and I've only had it for 2 days. Maybe clear nail polish will prevent this?PROS1. The case feels very sturdy in my hand.2. Cut outs are perfect for speakers, charging, headphones, etc3. Home and volume buttons are very easy to press. Probably harder to press WITHOUT the case.OVERALLThough i think the case itself will last a little while, I wish I would have saved my money for a different (not necessarily more expensive) case that would not get as dirty and SCRATCH so easily!

One method I found it  best was to talk to the seller about the phone before buying it. Its better than asking questions under the question forum where one half of the people have had a bad product and the other half have had a good one. Its hard to determine whether you'll get a good product or a bad product by  somebody's own experience. I recommend talking to the seller, they were kind and were very accurate with their product. The seller I recommend is Put Group USA. They seem to be doing pretty good but I had to check for myself. People had been getting locked phones. Mines was unlocked, all i needed to do was insert my T-Mobile sim card. People claimed when updating to ios 7 the phone ran slow. My phone remained the same, it works perfectly. Its not slow at all. The problem is also don't always go with the used phones, because although they may claim they are in perfectly good condition when they tend to be messed with. Just go with Put Group USA, and talk to them first.

People tell me if I am holding it in the hallway their eyes track immediately to it.  If you have incipio's red feather case, this isn't the same color of red. :)  I wasn't expecting it to be exactly the same, but I was hoping it would be close.  It is more of a ferrari red, as someone put it, and it is glossy to boot! ;)The case feels like it will be just as slick as the iPhone 4S itself, but if I hold my hand open with the case and phone in it... and rotate to a 45 degree there is enough friction that it barely creeps out of my hand.While the battery does add some bulk, they have take the apple approach and rounded out the edges enough that if you hold this case in your hand, it feels slimmer than an iPhone with a bumper case.  I personally prefer the feel of this case (and the small additional weight) to that of the phone with a bumper on it.  The initial reaction I get when other see it, and find out that it has a battery it in, is "There's a battery in there?  It is really thin if it has a battery, how long does it extend your use time?"I have only had the case a few days at this point, but with my usage I am finding that if I press and hold the button to start charging the phone back up at 40% that I will get to 100%.  I haven't stopped using the phone, yet, however, while it was charging.  Generally I am still browsing the web or talking on the phone for about 15 - 20% of the time it is charging the phone.  I also haven't paid too much attention to how long it takes to get the phone that far... but my best guess would be it is about 1 hour.  I also haven't paid too close attention to the charging time of the case (I will generally deplete the case and then slip it off to charge it back up and keep using my phone with the incipio feather case).  It feels like it takes a long time, but I haven't really timed it, rough guess would be 1.5 hours to charge the case itself.I have charged my case with my old HTC EVO charger and used the same cable to sync the phone with iTunes through the micro USB cable.  So that is very convenient considering that most other electronics I own use the standard micro USB.  The case doesn't appear to be as picky as Apple about which charge it will accept... for example, in my car I have a USB charger from my jabra headset that the phone wouldn't charge from itself using an apple cable.  However, if I plug in the case with a micro USB into the same charger, the case will light up and start charging (the iPhone doesn't charge in this instance however).  The jabra charger is pushing out 5V 750mAh.  I purchased another charger which was for the iPhone 4S [...] which pushes 5V, 1 Amp and this will charge both the case and the phone (together or separate, meaning it will charge the iPhone 4S will the apple cable).Cannot comment on Protection as I haven't dropped the phone (with our without the case), and I hope I never do.  It does feel sturdy enough, however, to take a hit, just not a drop that is face down (see "minor issues" below).Minor issues:- I have an iPhone 4S so the ringer silencer is very close the edge of the hole as this case is for the iPhone 4 and apple moved the ringer silencer on the 4S.- the Flash is not usable while using the case as the hole for the camera/flash is so deep the flash comes back into the camera sensor and causes the picture to look washed out.- The hole for the flash and camera acts like a lint scrapper and picks up a lot of lint from my pocket.- Hole for the volume buttons is a little deep and makes it difficult to access them.- speaker is covered by the micro USB, but they appear to have a slot to push the sound out of the front toward the user... I haven't noticed a huge degradation in audio quality/volume however, calls on speaker and music through the speaker are still audible and plenty loud for me.-Case doesn't protect the front of the phone at all, if placed face down on a table, the screen would be resting on the table.-Glossy packaging (similar to the plastic on the back of the iPhone 3G/3Gs) make me feel like the case will look scratched up after some time (so far so good though over 1 week of setting it on tables in meetings and in restaurants and plenty of pocket insertions and removals.  None of that very harsh, however)Overall: Very slick looking case, especially for having a battery.  Highly recommend at this point if you are looking for a case that will give you a power bump to get your another 60% + of extra batter power in a slim design.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004UDRREK" id="B004UDRREK-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-11-28:</strong> The Incipio Offgrid caught my eye because of how thin it is... for $45 I think its a steal... retail at $70.

The outer cover is holding up well so far, however the plastic part that the phone snaps into has a few flaws. Firstly, it isn't exactly the perfect fit. From day one I could not fit the upper left corner of the phone so that it seats perfectly in the holder. A little bit of the upper left edge (bezel) is not secured as it should be. Second. the plastic slots near the two side phone buttons are very thin, and are easily broken when trying to remove the phone from the case. This has already happened to me. Thirdly, the top and bottom of the phone are not protected by any part of the case. If you happen to drop your phone on the top or bottom, it could be damaged or marred. The case looks good and all buttons, speakers, mics, sensors, cameras, USB and headphone ports are accessible. It also protects the screen very well as there is a stiff card (probably plastic) of some kind sewed into the front cover. It will certainly protect your phone from keys etc. in your pocket, but may not be as protective as some other covers out there.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BIET580" id="B00BIET580-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-23:</strong> This is a replacement for my wife.

When the clasp is on the right, and the case opened "naturally," like a book, the Note is upside down.  I've only had it (and my new Note) a day, and am getting used to it.  No biggie.The leather has a nice feel in the hand.  While not bulky, it has enough padding to provide some possibility a Note inside dropped to the ground would survive.  Be aware, though, that while the Note is remarkably lightweight for its size, gravity will do as gravity does.It is pocketable, well, if you have commodious pockets. Don't think it will work with those new stylish lycra tights . . .When "snapped" into the case all the Note's ports and controls are accessible.One surprise. When the front cover is folded back, there's a "slot" into which a finger nicely nestles, which greatly helps when "one-handing" the otherwise cumbersomely large Note.I have, and really love, the Case Crown nylon rip-stop bags I've used for my iPad and MacBook Air.  Senyx, the seller from which I bought, has reliably sold me several bags through Amazon, some shipped direct, others fulfilled by Amazon.I can recommend this case for your Note.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B007BTV2NW', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B007BTV2NW', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B009C45V54</h2>    <p class="price"> $B009C45V54</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009C45V54" id="B009C45V54-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-20:</strong> This case fits perfectly on my iPhone 5s.

I absolutely love their cases and own 4 of the Glide for Iphone 4S in various colors.  I purchased the Flex while waiting for the Glide for the Iphone 5 (which has since been released in two awful colors!).  All I can say is this case sucks.  First off, the power button doesnt come in contact with the iphones power button so it is nearly impossible to turn off the phone without putting a dent in your fingertip.  Second is the case material itself, I bought the orange and within a week it was down right dirty from being in my pants pocket and my bags.

I had a few for my iphone 4, for my daughter's Iphone 5 (this case), and about 10 for my Samsung S3.  They make three type of cases, the normal thin, hard case, a line called the Breathe (which is like the hard case with holes), and the Flex, which is a firm, flexible case.  The only bad thing I have to say about the Flex case is that it seems that the color is painted on a black tpu case, and the lighter colors (like this light blue case) gets dirty and when washed the black tends to come thru especially on the corners.  This is not a problem with the darker colors like navy blue, black, brown, etc.  Other then that the case fits very well and is not bulky.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009C45V54" id="B009C45V54-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-03:</strong> i used for 3 months.

I was skeptical at first because of the material (normally when I get a case like this the sides aren't very tight and they sometimes protrude out from the phone making the case useless) but after getting it and using it for the past few days, its great. I have no problem with the dust and dirt issues. The only thing that bothers me is what everyone else is saying - the lock button and volume buttons are tight/hard to press. Once you press them, you get no feedback from touch (you don't get that clicking sound or feeling that you are even hitting the buttons) but they do work. The volume buttons are finally getting broken in so  I can feel them being pressed. The lock button is getting more loose too. Just keep using it and it will loosen up. When you put it on, make sure you push the sides on good. There must be a lip on the case and it needs to be flush against the sides to ensure it is on PERFECTLY. Overall, great minimal case. Its not bulky at all and fits in the pocket easily. Tight fit and easy to take off and on. Cut outs are perfect. Given the material, I don't recommend taking the case off and on a lot - it may not be as tight as when it was first put on.

I guess you could say I am a picky case person. Are there any problems? Well, as of now, yes. The lock and volume buttons are very sensitive, something I have never seen from a case. Its not a big deal. It's just me being picky. Anyways, I'm thinking they will break in a little more as time goes on. Overall though, For the price, buy this case. There are great colors, it fits great in the hand, and the are more good things than bad things about this case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009C45V54" id="B009C45V54-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-25:</strong> Great case for people seeking extra protection.  I prefer the s5 slim fit case, but this is a nice case for when I go to workout or on a run.  Phone feels protected all around.  Buttons are perfect and easy to push.  Cutouts are precise.  I really like the color.  The only thing I did not like about the case is that they didn't design it with a logo cutout like the slim fit.  I think that would've made the case look a lot better.Overall, great case for the price.  Elago, in my opinion, makes the best cases for iPhones.  They are sleek, minimal and precise.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009C45V54" id="B009C45V54-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-14:</strong> Great price, color and quality</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009C45V54" id="B009C45V54-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-05:</strong> Bad Looks ugly in handydont use it.

There's a trick to do this, however.  Just remove or bend pin #1 on the diagram below, which is the pin closest to the diagonal corner of the USB port.  If you look closely at the USB port on your phone, you'll see that the other three corners are square.  Note that remove the pin from this cheap adapter, not your precious phone.The way I removed the pin was by using a sewing needle to pry the pin out of its location.  Then use a small flat screwdriver to push the pin all the way down inside the jack.I tried this on my Mogul with Windows Mobile 6.1, and it works great.  Now I can listen to my music via the tape adapter on my car or via my headphone (both having 3.5mm jack).  The charger can work at the same time as well without any distortion on the sound._______________|************||************||*1*2*3*4*5*6.|.\_____________|Source:[...]</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001RXTDP2" id="B001RXTDP2-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2009-08-31:</strong> i'm running a 3rd party ROM (cyanogenmod) which is cupcake plus some donut, on my HTC dream, and it works for me. i tried the 3.5mm port, and the USB headset port while charging and all is good. no headset switching software.IMO, this thing is too big to use as a simple 3.5mm &lt;-> USB adapter while mobile. if you need that, buy one that is dedicated to that purpose. this one is good when you are stationary, and you want to charge / listen to headset at the same time.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001RXTDP2" id="B001RXTDP2-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2009-10-04:</strong> This a solid OEM, straight-from-HTC adapter that works fantastic with my HTC Vogue (Verizon Touch).

I can now listen to pandora radio or the songs I have downloaded to my phone through my car stereo and not worry about draining my battery at all on those long trips. I also use it at work with my portable speakers.I was a little worried after reading some of the negative reviews with people having problems getting this to work and having to download programs, but I figured for the price it was worth a shot.

But if you are looking at using the 3.5mm jack on the adapter, then this is going to be useless. Your phone won't recognize the after market headphones that is plugged into it, unless you buy the "Sound Route Switcher" on the app market.Overall, it works great for roadtrips but, not good for taking on a walk or jogging.

With that comes some practical issues involving the purchase and installation of apps and games. The user forums were invaluable in helping getting this resolved and getting back on track. Once passed that hiccup you will find most apps are somewhat glitchy. Again, as an older model, it does not have a modern processor or even a removable memory card. The camera is passable. This device reminds me of the early BlackBerry products good for two things - email and text. The keyboard is nicely setup and is an absolute necessity with a phone this small. However, that's the upside. This phone is very small and disappears in a pocket unlike an iPhone or Galaxy. This has turned out to be a good starter phone for my young daughter as b it's built well and fits her smaller hand perfectly.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004IPAC10" id="B004IPAC10-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-12-28:</strong> My DroidX broke, but usual story: I'm not up for a discounted phone for a few mos. So I picked up the Pixi+ to use until then. I wanted something a little simpler, but not too simple like a basic phone.Count me as another "new, accidental" user who previously gave little thought to WebOS, now a little disappointed that it's barely hanging on. I only picked up the Pixi+ because of my situation, and I thought it would just be neat to try something different for the time being. Wow, it has a neat and intuitive interface. While the phone obviously can't do what the DroidX does by way of features and apps, I really like the card-and-swipe UI (disclaimer: the Homebrew patches help to make it much better).I really like the launcher and icons (better than what I've seen on the iPhone). And I finally realize that I need a "real" keyboard. I had to correct almost every individual word on the touch-screen keyboard of my Android, which was probably the most frustrating thing of all for me (I realize some Android phones have keyboards). And I did try other keyboard apps.I never would have gotten the Pixi had my phone not broken because it looks a little cheap and ugly (to me) in the pictures. But now that I have it, the keyboard and form factor are great, other than maybe the smallish screen.There are a few things I can't get to work as I'd like. The AIM simply won't log in (it's probably outdated). The music skips a little too frequently due to the slow processor (even overclocked). And I can't get Navi to work for me. You're not going to get Google Sky Maps on here. But for the basics, some things are better than what I had on the DroidX (IMO). The email works way better (even Gmail). the notifications banners are really nice. I like the browser experience simply because of the swipe and bookmark list -- it's just easy. The calendar is nicer and works better. List/note apps and other things are more convenient. Everything is "right there" with no complications swiping apps open, closed, and between several running apps at once. YouMail is better. Deleting things like email, vmail messages, bookmarks, etc is all swipe-easy. Even my Gmail contacts seem to link better. With the Homebrew patches, this thing holds its own even on an old OS / phone. So even with an older phone and less features, I find that I really like it better overall.Lastly, the Pixi+ transitions seamlessly between Wifi and 3G. I've had no issues so far (after several weeks) unlike with my Android phone.It's too bad WebOS wasn't bought by a company that could support it, or at least incorporate it into its current ecosystem. But it is what it is.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004IPAC10" id="B004IPAC10-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-03-17:</strong> I was about to return this phone because Verizon wanted a $45 data plan just to activate it; then I read the brilliant comments by Chuck Homic.Opening the package, I saw the ESN/MEID HEX printed on the box. I held down the power button until the PALM light lit up on-screen. It took a while for it to boot up. The phone tried twice to call Verizon and activate itself, to no avail.On another phone, I called the Page Plus Cellular toll-free number and gave them the Pixi's MEID and the phone number that I wanted ported from my active, prepaid Verizon phone. They gave me a 'Premier Package' 6-digit activation code to dial from Pixi, and said that Verizon is usually quick to release your old number and to call back when they have done so.It took about an hour or so that the old cell number stopped ringing the old phone, indicating that it had been ported.In order to dial the activation code on the Pixi, you first press the little phone symbol on the screen and press Emergency Call. When the dialpad shows, hit the backspace three times to erase the 911 off the screen. Enter the six-digit code and hit the Call button. The phone will take a while to activate and will need to be rebooted when it's finished.After you reboot the phone, you'll have to do the Phone Symbol- Emergency Call- erase 911- thing again. Now on the dialpad, try to call a phone number near you to test, like a home number or something. When the phone near you rings, hang up and listen for the confirmation on the phone that it's working.IMPORTANT: Page Plus Cellular gives your account about $2 worth of phone/ text/ data to start your service. Because the Palm Pixi Plus requires a data connection to set up the Palm Profile and activate FIRST, you cannot use WiFi yet to do this. The $2 credit should be plenty to just set up your profile; if not, then call them from another phone and make sure you get the full-on Premier activation code.When I was told this, and since I only use the Voice feature for rare 'emergency' and 'notice' calls, then I opted for the Standard Plan of $10 for 100 minutes that expire after 120 days ($30/year).After the Palm Profile was set up, a brief video tutorial ensued. I then immediately tapped on the Signal Bars symbols to turn on the WiFi, and entered my router's WPA security code for access to my home WiFi network.Now using my own WiFi, I felt FREE to import/ associate the Pixi with my Google contacts, emails, and calendar. Sweet.Here are my notes on this - [Amazon took away the link to my SpringPad notes - [...] ]UPDATE: I've put 380+ songs on it, plus the Pandora App, and I still have 5gb of space.The 'Amazon MP3' app is already built in. The music sounds so good that I ordered the Palm headset as well. I also like the AccuWeather app and about 16 others.UPDATE: I got the dedicated Palm stereo headset for about $3 and discovered that double-clicking the Mic Mute button will advance to the next song (FF) - see review:Palm Stereo Headset for Palm Pixi and Palm Pre. At that price, I try to keep a pair in the car, work, etc.UPDATE: I got a deal on the Belkin Bluetooth dongle for Home Stereo -NEW Version Belkin F8Z492-P Bluetooth Music Receiverand so that I could play my music on the Pixi over my full system; I really like that.UPDATE: plugging and unplugging the charge cord was starting to be a chore, so I bought the TouchStone inductive charger from Palm where you just lay the phone on top of the thing -Palm Touchstone Charging Dock for Palm Pre and Palm Pixi. You have to use a special jacket w/ the TouchStone, and I chose one in bright orange -Palm Pixi Touchstone Cover (orange)UPDATE: THE HOLY GRAIL FOUND -- 'Mark' commented on Chuck Homic's post on Jun 16, 2011 - how to keep voice calls coming in while shutting off cellular data usage but still allowing for WiFi data flow:Mark says -"Mobile hotspot is *not* the only way to consume data. The phone will try to use data silently in the background for you. But you can make it so that it won't do it via carrier data. Open up the phone app (the green phone handset icon), swipe down on the upper left hand menu and select "Preferences and Accounts". A new card will come up. Scroll to the bottom and you should see something labled "Data Usage". Set that to "OFF". This will also extend your battery life on the phone by quite a bit.""If you really want to use the background data features of the phone - called "Synergy" - enable wifi and connect to your home wifi network."Thanks, Mark</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004IPAC10" id="B004IPAC10-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-03-30:</strong> Ah I had to return the phone the guy did refund my money, so I can not say anything bad about him but the phone was reported lost, I could not activate it it became useless to me, so I then contacted him and mailed the phone back the next morning, along with a tracking number something he never provided me with I like to do good business he says he did not know the phone was report lost or stolen but that is his problem not mine.I returned it and I am done, I am not using products that are hot, if you want something new purchase new I purchased from Closeout Masters.

It is a terrific phone for what I paid: $36 from the OEM shop (notated as there are several different marketplace sellers).  My experience was very good, phone arrived fast, and new (other reviewers commented on having trouble activating used phones).  The package included a wall charger and usb charger.I'd like to thank many reviewers who pointed to pageplus!  what a fantastic deal, and very nice people too.  Regards activation, it took a bit more time as the msin # was not on the box and had to be retrieved from inside the phone, under the battery (not a huge issue, just took a bit of extra time).  I will also note that the 12 cents left after activation is *before you put any money in*.  After activation I had just over 100 minutes, ample time to check the phone/ service/ coverage; all very good.Back to the phone itself: as one with many (too many) cell phones... mostly from bad experience; poor service/ coverage etc  I would compare this favorably to every other phone I have bought in this price range (e.g. the lg620gLG 620G Prepaid Phone (Net10)which is an adequate phone, but nowhere near as nice or fully featured as this phone.  I would also compare it favorably to the motorola razor (not a very smart or solid phone) as well as several basic Nokias.  The pixi is an early  smart phone (as in pre-android).  It has PDA features (contacts, task list) implemented as cards (basically ap icons) an MP3 & video player, which unlike on some other phones/ services, you can add your own music to my dragging & dropping.  It also has a button to connect to Amazon's MP3 store.  The phone has "synchrony" to  connect to google, MS outlook and palm's website, which brings me to one important feature I *really dislike* : Your info will be stored on Palm's server.  I personally hate the intrusion on privacy and am hoping for legislation to contain it. But, this is something you should know.  It will limit how I use my phone! There are friends who also value their privacy... I can not will not put them in my contact list, so that cripples the phone somewhat for me.  I also will not use an organizer function which posts my appointments to any web site.  I am a psychologist, (there are real ethical issues here). I am hoping this is not a trend.  If it is, I will be buying up last gen phones rather than succumb to the intrusion.The phone also has a web browser (verizon's implementation) email connects, as well as popular social networking sites.My complaints with this phone are few and mostly related to Verizon; the documentation is minimal at best (e.g. to transfer music, drag & drop... it does not say where.  I put different songs in the phone window, and created a music folder within it, both were picked up by the MP3 player).  I have not yet figured out if I can create ringtones on it, but know, at least that I can import them (some phones block this, forcing you to buy from the service).  The user guide has more information on how to use gestures, unique to this platform, than other aps. or even the physical phone (when I needed to remove the battery to activate, there was no info on how to open the phone...) It was fairly simple, and info available out on the web, but why was it not included in the user manual?  It seems the manuals (3 included) are more about disclainmers & safety warnings (don't listen to your music too loud, throw your battery in a  fire: good one, submerge in water... so it is a process of discovery, finding out what all of the features are.  It is not a complicated phone to figure out or use, but reasonable documentation is nice.  Some of us *do* read the manual ;)In brief: This is a great phone for what it is currently selling for.  You can use it as a prepaid phone on cdma networks. It is a smart (not android) phone with PDA functions, a browser, MP3 and video player, a camera (which I forgot to mention earlier) which also shoots video (not very high quality, but then none of them are) and some features which can make set up etc easier for some as it uses synchronicity to pull down your contacts, to do lists... from other sites (if you give it permission).  It also has aps and google maps on board (you have to enable google snoop to use them).cons:Poor documantation/ user manuals, no memory expansion (but a good amount on board), have to agree to Palm's terms of use which will pick up information you enter. (Note: other "features" require giving permission to various services, but those can be denied, Palm's can not).  I personally do not like being tracked or having my personal info distributed, sold... and will always opt-out.  Fortunately most of these decisions are put in your hands (so you can opt to use google maps if you permit google, e.g.  I have several of these features turned off or crippled on my phone, but still think it is a terrific phone for what it costs; best I have found so far.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004IPAC10" id="B004IPAC10-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-07-19:</strong> description should tell all --- not Palm's best work -- freezes way too often -- says 8 gb memory but you get error message after error message saying toss cards too many apps open.

Once it booted up, I was prompted to activate the phone with Verizon Wireless. I shut the phone off, went to my account page on Verizon's website, activated the phone, then started over again.After activation, I was prompted to create a Palm account. The first thing I noticed was how cramped and sludgy feeling, yet clicky the keyboard is. The second thing I noticed was how slow this thing is. But I wasn't expecting much from a smartphone with a 600mhz processor. Seriously though, when I tried to change my ringtone, it took 5-10 seconds for the phone to gather and display the ringtones. "Seconds" doesn't usually indicate a long time, but compare it to any smartphone released in the past year and it'll seem slow.Once initial setup was completed, a walkthrough began to play which demonstrated how to use the phone's gestures. What looks like dead space/useless bezel between the keyboard and the screen is actually a touch panel for back, forward, and up gestures which feeds back with a soothing, glowing strip of light.Web OS is pretty nice though. I like the way multitasking works and it's fairly simple to use with little learning curve. If you want to search for an installed app, search the web, or search for an address or business, just start typing and a card will appear which lets you choose Google, Google Maps, Wikipedia or Twitter. Adding custom ringtones and wallpapers is refreshingly easy; Similar to Android devices, you can plug the phone in, choose "USB Storage" and just drag your wallpaper images into the "Wallpapers" folder, and ringtones and notification sounds into the "Ringtones" folder.Overall, the phone looks cute and fits nicely in the pocket. The soft back cover is nice (I prefer soft touch to glossy plastic or even glass). It's a functional device that will provide you with entertainment, information and communication on the go. There is an app store and some widely used apps are available (Evernote, Pandora, Accuweather, a Twitter app, Facebook, Angry Birds, etc). And even though pretty much every smartphone has it, the mobile hotspot functionality comes in handy (if you pay for it).Despite it's crappy 2MP camera, fixed 8GB of storage (that's right, no MicroSD card slot) tiny, low quality screen (but at least it's glass and capacitive) and tiny keys, it's worth buying since it's only $40 off-contract here on Amazon. If HP didn't give up on WebOS and Palm devices, it would probably cost at least $250. So, it's not a bad deal. The only reason I bought it was for the price. I sold my iPhone 4 months ago and have been using a basic cell phone. I missed having an mp3 player, map, camera, casual game player and web browser on me. I'm not eligible for an upgrade for another year, I can't spend $500+ on a new phone at full retail, and I'm sick of sketchy Craigslist sales and used phones with scratched displays, caked up skin flakes and dirt in the crevices, and lingering cologne/perfume odors. Honestly, I was pleasantly surprised with WebOS. But the OS and the device itself are lacking - A LOT - and if there was a faster, better WebOS phone available for a typical smartphone retail price, I wouldn't buy it.Most people replace their smartphones within a year or two, so the fact that HP gave up on WebOS isn't that big of a deal. Just don't expect a ton of updates and support. The phone has 3-4 year old hardware anyway. If you're in a similar situation as I am (i.e., too poor to buy a new phone off contract, but not too poor to pay your share of a family account) or want a pre-paid phone, it's not a bad purchase. I could also see this being useful for someone who has an expensive smartphone but wants a second device when there may be a risk of losing or damaging their good phone.Too bad I couldn't get a Touchpad when the liquidation happened. That would have been nice. It's cool how they transfer links and other data. I ordered one from OnSale through Amazon. They took way more orders than they could fill and cancelled a ton of them after holding everyone's money for a few days. That sucked.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004IPAC10" id="B004IPAC10-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-07-10:</strong> I very much appreciated the review that talked about getting a Pixi Plus, using only WiFi, staying off of Verizon by signing up with a reseller like Page Plus--everything is working so far in terms of "free" e-mail, web, etc. access as long as I'm near WiFi (at home and work, mostly). My old Palm PDA was dying, and this has been a great replacement.The only regret I have is that a few apps from the past aren't available on the newer operating system of the Pixi Plus (HanDbase, for example); other than that (and the need to charge this every night!!), I'm quite satisfied so far.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004IPAC10" id="B004IPAC10-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-06-05:</strong> At this point,(I have only had this cell phone a month now) I feel it is becoming one of the best devices I have ever bought. The last Palm device I bought at Amazon with paying full freight, was the Palm TX, a big disappointment. Taught me a great lesson, never pay full retail for electronics again, the price will drop even if it's older technology. As a result Palm lost me for many years as a customer after being a long time user. Until now. Could not resist this device at $56,which AT&T; sells unlocked for hundreds. Web OS is one of the slickest OS's ever encountered outside iPhone/touch, having no experience with Androids can't comment. Hardware is good, resolution very good, ringer volume on the low side but acceptable for me.If you follow previous comments on how to activate the phone sans Verizon(see Chuck Homic,he is the reason I went for it(the method described worked superbly), it's the best bargain out there in the world of smartphones. Cellular portion of the phone I rarely use(though that works excellently), I mainly wanted it for it's wi-fi capabilities, and that's free. In a sense it's like an iPod touch with a cell phone attached. With Kitty wireless you can get good deals on pins and texting, good small company to deal in tandem with Pageplus, with all your cell phone needs. $30 dollars a year to keep the phone active, is a huge message to the big carriers that there are cheap alternatives, if you are willing to deal with not having the latest rage device, this is one heck of a phone, in a class of it's own.Not a big gabber on the phone, so the low volume on incoming calls didn't bother me too much, you can always wear a headset, no mic needed. Lots of complaints over screen size, it's no bigger or smaller than most BlackBerry's out there I believe, when navigating web sites you do have to really pinch and zoom and double tap a lot.  You can use iTunes or windows media to sort of organize your stuff on the phone itself. Just drag iTunes music directly in to the device, you can use Windows Media Player, or in my case, Windows explorer drag and drop. Options galore.The only minor complaint I have is the the ringer and speaker volume could be louder. I basically use this as my MP3 player and hearing the ringer with a headset is plenty loud, but being in a loud environment trying to hear a ringer might be a bit difficult, vibrate only works with one pulse and it's over. But the phone portion is not that critical for me, remember Verizon network has the least amount of dropped calls, which is comforting.The browser and the synergy gathering of your email accounts work very well, overall an outstanding deal, I'm happy. At this price buy 2 or more for gifts. They'll love you.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004IPAC10" id="B004IPAC10-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-09-17:</strong> I like almost everything about this phone. I like having a smartphone that is inexpensive, small, has a physical keyboard, and can do all the important tasks like make calls, send texts and emails, and surf the internet. I don't care that much about processor speed, apps, etc. This phone costs almost nothing and does everything I need it to, on an OS that I think is better the iOS or Android (WebOS is very intuitive and easy to use and Apple copied a lot of ideas from it).The problem is that the quality of this phone is so bad. The cover starts peeling apart after a few months of normal, light use. I the touch screen stopped working. It made a weird wailing noise every time it received an incoming call (even with the ringer on silent). It's just a shame because I don't want to carry around a huge Android phone and I don't want to fork over a ridiculous premium for an iPhone. But after my second Palm Pixi falling apart, it's just not worth it to get another one. Too bad.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004IPAC10" id="B004IPAC10-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-04-16:</strong> This phone is such a hassle for me that I am quite burnt out.

However, I have some MAJOR complaints and dissatisfaction about the Bluetooth feature1.) the Bluetooth feature DO NOT support pairing with other device(phone) or computer.  WTH?  even my 2008 Window Mobile phone support it.2.) Bluetooth feature ONLY support pair with COMPATIBLE headset.[...]3.) the compatible headset list is very short.  my Kensington headset does not work, so are some of my newer motorola headset.  WTH.I guess, Windows Mobile's compatibility still better than webOS .BT transfer is such an useful tool, how can they let this feature slip away?  Also, I confirmed that with Palm tech support.  It is true for the Palm Pre 2 also!!Update: Ok. I also found out that you cannot delete downloaded or transfer file on the device itself.  You have to use USB cable to connect to computer, THEN delete the file!  There is no "window explorer" or anything similar to go the the proper file directory to delete the file.  WTH!?!!!  even BB and Windows mobile 5 and 6 can do it back in 2007.  Can Palm do any better?Update #2: Somehow my hotspot didn't work anymore.  The only thing that I hadn't done is hard-resting.  On the Backup menu, it stated that "Your data is backup automatically every day."  So, I took it that it really does that.  However, I am SO wrong about it.  It is NOT.  I hard reset per VZ representative instructed.  Yes, I got the hotspot working again.  However, the data is not backed up!!  I am talking just the contact info, not even the memo and txt.  And the phone becomes not as responsive and sometimes freeze after this hard reset.  horrible.Update #3:  After using the phone for 6 months now, I realize the battery life starts to give.  I am a very light phone and internet user, may be only get online for 15-30 min, and talk 30-45 min per day.  The battery will last only 8-12 hours, sometimes even less.  When it was new, it was at least 12 to 18 hours.Update #4:  This is the 7th month of experience.  The phone has become very laggy and even "temporary freeze" randomly.  The message "too many cards have been open" become more frequent.  I have to do restart the phone every time.  Another thing is that I think the is a "bug" when receiving CJK txt messages.  First, the phone doesn't support CJK (Chinese Japanes Korean) language on TXT meg.  However, view CJK web site has no problem.  Anyway, the main problem here is that, when any CJK txt message is reviewed.  The phone will randomly restart.  Until I delete those CJK message.  the restarting problem is cured.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004IPAC10" id="B004IPAC10-review24" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-19:</strong> This product is not bad for one the early smart phones.

The case has the look and feel of something much more expensive. One small note of caution: when you decide to take the phone out, take your time and use caution. As the fit is so precise, you do need to "massage" the phone out of the case (very gently), to make sure you do not scratch or mar anything.

It's been on my phone for about 3 weeks now, and it looks just like it does the day I put it on!

After reading reviews for several similar products, I finally decided to get GreatShield Ultra Anti-Glare (Matte) Clear Screen Protector Film. Honestly, I was not disappointed.The instructions were easy. I like that the film doesn't fully extend and cover the whole front of the phone, leaving a a cm of space from the edge. This is good especially to those who has a phone case cover that hugs and extends towards the front-face of the phone (like mine does). However, lining the upper film cut-outs to the phone takes a bit of time. The anti-glare/matte finish works great even under direct light. The cover has a high quality finish which doesn't impair the phone's touch screen. Price is affordable.TIPS for a lint/bubble free application:1. Use a small drop of rubbing alcohol. This dissolves any fingerprint oils & easily air drys.2. Use tweezers to hold the film.3. Apply film in a relatively dust-free room that has minimal air current.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00872R5SI', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00872R5SI', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B008CENSA0</h2>    <p class="price"> $B008CENSA0</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008CENSA0" id="B008CENSA0-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-13:</strong> The case fits my s3 and makes it look really cool but makes my phone sticky and dirty. Also the case on the inside gets dirty real fast. The case seems to be made out of cheap material cause I washed my phone case than dried it and put it on my phone and an hour later some of the material inside the case melted on the power button of my phone and it got stuck and my phone wouldn't turn. I had to clean all that stuff off my power button and take out the battery and clean a bit of the inside before the phone would even turn on. Totally makes your phone different but not worth it. There are better ceases under $5 like the gameboy. Iv'e bought other cheap ceases under $5 and they work a million times better than this one.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008CENSA0" id="B008CENSA0-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-07:</strong> The item had a very early arrival and met all expectations that I had for the product.

Personally, I wish it had more (or any) frontal protection. But I understand that the iPhone 4S's screen area is not that large to begin with. I don't want to argue with iPhone peeps. Spare me, please.For parents searching for a robust case (i.e., a case that will prevent damage to their child's iPhone), I would suggest investing in a so-called &#34;LifeProof&#34; case instead. LifeProof offers superior shock protection and something that no other iPhone case even considers -- water proof protection. To me, $45 for a LifeProof case (protecting an iPhone 4S) is a wise investment.Nevertheless, if you're a fairly careful person, or if you believe your kids are (good luck on that), the Otterbox will offer a fair amount of protection from shock.  But, if it gets wet, or if they strike the frontal area of the iPhone, then as they say, &#34;have a nice day.&#34;LifeProof for kids.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-12-22:</strong> ordered yellow/gray to replace my current black on black otterbox commuter case for my iphone 4s. the yellow/gray case arrived much stiffer as though product was too old. could not get charging cover to stay closed. will retun for refund.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-19:</strong> Not heavy duty enough for me.

All I had to do is fill out the form on their website and the next day they sent a new one. Not only that but, the small crack in the case is the only damage I've noticed to the case or my phone since I've had it and I am really clumsy with my phone.

It fits well, looks like it will do a nice amount of protection since it states it will provide shock absorbance, dust resistant (doubt that, all rubber cases attract dust) and scratch resistant, but I've had past experiences with otterbox cases for my past smartphones and all the cases I've owned did a great job. The only bad thing about this case is the installment of the case itself. The iPhone pops right into the rubber layer easily, but squeezing the phone into the hardshell case is a pain in the ass. It tells you on the directions to put the phone in the bottom first, then pushing it into the top. I've tried both ways (putting the phone in from the top and bottom) and both were really difficult to do. Once I put it in the bottom way, trying to push down on the phone so I could squeeze the top half of the phone into the top of the hard case was a pain in the ass as well. You have to literally bend the hard case over the top of the phone and try to get the lock button and headphone cover buttons into the holes without pushing the rubber part off the phone, which will happen. I've had to re-apply the case into the hard shell part numerous times, and I've finally gotten it right...I think. Another tiny problem that annoys me is the top right of the case of the phone doesn't seem "snug", it looks like the rubber part isn't fully inside the hard case. Overall, it's a great case and will do it's job but prepare for a hard time putting the hard shell case on the rubber part.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-14:</strong> These cases are very good quality and protect my iPhone very well.

However after trying out some other cases of other brands recently, that were all smaller more sleek cases, I decided to order a Otterbox Commuter case to try it out. It's significantly slimmer than the Defender, so I find it fits in my jeans pockets easier. Both the Defender and the Commuter use a 2 case design of one case fitted inside of another. The inner case of the Defender is hard plastic, with the outer case being soft rubber. The Commuter case is the opposite, having a soft case for the inside and a hard plastic case for the outside.Check to make certain when you order your case that you are getting it from Amazon themselves (might also say "Fulfilled by Amazon"), if you want to be certain you are not buying a knock off fake. While the majority of 3rd party sellers here are probably selling the genuine thing, a number of recent negative experiences many have people have posted about in their reviews sounds as though one of the sellers was shipping out fakes. Real Otterbox cases are tough, and last a long time. They don't fall apart within days. If you're buying this and able to get it shipped to you using Amazon Prime Delivery or Amazon Super Saver Delivery, you are getting it from Amazon themselves and should receive the genuine case.I ordered the Hot Pink and White case, and I find it's a little lighter in color than the online photo shows. Online the case looks almost fuschia, but in hand it's a lighter shade. It comes with a screen protector you can apply to your iPhone touch screen, and it goes on quite well. All the buttons on my phone are easily accessed when it's in this case, and there are snug gaskets over the charging port and earphone port to help your phone resist being damaged should it come in contact with water. It's a cute case and I think I'll be ordering a second one in another color. If you're looking for a little extra added protection, check out Otterbox Defender line.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review33" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-01:</strong> My Husband liked my otter box for my 5 and when he received this one for his 4 he was quit pleased.

The commuter case is nice because it is not as big as the defender series, but it still offers 2 layers of protection.  It still makes the phone easy to fit in a pocket but protects it in case you drop it.  The covers over the ports are nice as well as it gives the phone a little defense against moisture and the all evil pocket lent.  The only complaint is that it leaves the camera wide open, but most cases do anyway.I know that prices can change based on demand, especially accessories like these that are for older model phones, but it is slightly frustrating that there can be a $10 difference.  I also find it amusing that they offer &#34;frustration free packaging&#34; considering the packages in the stores are so frustration free that half the time in Walmart they are stolen straight out of the package.All in all, a great recommendation for any owner of this phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review35" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-09:</strong> I've been buying my family the Otterbox Commuters now for all their iphones.

That case too started to chip, and so I was a little disappointed and purchased the speck case. So far the speck case hasn't cracked (knock on wood!) and seems to offer the same protection as the otterbox. But you definitely can't beat the customerservice of the otterbox!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review37" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-17:</strong> love it would order it again, love the color, holds up real well, easy to hold in your hands thanks</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review38" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-12:</strong> Don't bother with this cover or risk breaking your phone.I don't understand the purpose of this cover since it puts the phone at risk.

This fits the bill. This case also comes with a screen protector that you really want to take your time applying, and ensuring that your screen is squeaky clean, and completely DUST FREE, like not even the little invisible hairs that can get on the screen (if that happens, you get bubbles).

One of my biggest pet peeves is if the picture misrepresents the product. Like so of the other reviews the only problem is that the silicone gets grungy very easily, and the polycarbonate case doesn't fit perfectly over the silicone case. No one would be able to notice though, unless they really look at it closely. This case is really easy put together.You can clean the silicone part by mixing 1/2 cup of Clorox, and water, then soak the silicone case for 1 night. You should have bright white again by morning!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review44" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-06-02:</strong> I bought this for an iPhone 4 and it fits perfectly. I especially like the big cut out around the flash and camera. First case that does not distort flash pictures. The best feature is what seems like good protection (I don't drop phones to check out the protection) and very little bulk especially compared to the defender series. The mic flap works well. The flap over the power can be a bit annoying but loosens up with repeated use.What I did not like was the screen protector. Just bad. Bubbles galore and I have put on other screen protectors and none of them got near the amount of bubbles this one did. It could have been user error but I am pretty careful with getting screen protectors on. Also it doesnt feel that good to hold. Now that is a trade off as I am sure the Otter protection comes from the rigid plastic. But the plastic doesn't feel particularly good. The inner rubber case does feel good where you can grip that though.Bottomline is a good trade off for adding minimal size yet providing what seems to be good protection. It also looks nice. I would just have another brand of screen protector on hand.Update: From the department of irony. A friend wanted to see the case when we were out walking. I took the case out in a swinging motion from my front parket and it fell forward onto hard concrete with a little forward momentum. Absoultely fine. So yes the hard rigid plastic doesn't feel great, but it does serve a purpose. And although less cushion feel then the defender series that gets you less added bulk and weight.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review45" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-11:</strong> Love the pink and the case feels good in your hands.

It is very solid, and defiantly protects your iphone through all kinds of falls/dents/scratches. However, I wish the back was fully covered so you don't have to use a back protector to cover the apple logo. The other thing is that the silicone attracts a lot of lint from your pockets. Only sometimes though, and it comes off very easily. I've used this case for 2 years now, and Otterbox even replaced my case for free when I told them that he had cracked at the bottom.

I've gotten multiple for friends as gifts one of my larger robust friends fell down a flight of stairs and landed on her iPhone in an OtterBox case and it survived. We jokingly call it the 1000 pound cart-wheel oh it's so funny!But the thing I like about this is that they slimmed it down from its bigger brother's and now is more manageable and to me that was the only thing I really had an issue with the other otter boxes I've seen.Definitely a good price and is well worth it for your expensive phone. The first time you do 1000 pound cart-wheel and your phone survives it'll be well worth the investment is like insurance.Thanks for reading!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review89" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-16:</strong> Well worth the money and I can't think of any case to have.

The hard part of the case, is a light teal, then the rubber part would be more of a really light teal, or a darker aqua. I bought this case for my iPhone 4s, and this case looks really good on the wight iPhone 4s. The quality of the case is finominal, and keeps all the buttons safe. The compartment where you would insert the power cord, is hard to open, because the rubber keeps it so safe but you get use to it after you plug it in a few times.

It's a perfect mix of the advantages of a hard and a soft case.  Hard cases are good if you like to keep your phone in a pocket- it slides in and out easily.  But soft cases offer more shock protection...  So a case that combines both is ideal.  There are a few others out there, but this one wins because of it's simplicity and low form factor- the most protection for the least amount of bulk.  My main complaint (which is pretty minor) is the unnecessary cut out for the Apple logo on the back- sure, some people may want to show off how cool they are owning an iPhone, but I really doubt most of us care or want that extra hole in the case.  Otherwise, highly recommended.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review111" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-15:</strong> Works great even if it is a bit difficult for us older folks who are all thumbs.

They include a very small cloth to clean the screen and a small plastic card to burnish the protector to you phone screen. Some brands will include a tacky strip to aid in removing small dust particles before installing a cover but OtterBox does not.The inner silicone shell is designed with a full front bezel and peel-back covers for your charging port and headphone jack. In addition your on/off switch and volumn buttons are fully covered. There is a wide opening for the camera and Apple Logo in the both the silicone case and outer hard shell.I was never able to get the hard shell fully seated on both sides of the phone. There are cut-outs on the sides of the silicone case where tabs on the hard case seat into. I could get one tab in but never both. If you don't get both sides seated the silicone frame is not snug and that part of the hard case doesn't lay flat. After removing and reinstalling the case three times I decided I don't like it well enough to hassle with it anymore.There is one other thing I don't like about the case but that is a personal preference. I don't like hard cases, I find them slippery and miss the grip I get from a TPU or all silicone case. Despite the hard case not covering the sides of the phone completely it does cover the area where you hold the phone. If you already use and like hard cases it wouldn't bother you.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review113" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-23:</strong> I ordered this for my 4s because I love Otterbox cases, but not the price of them.

So do I keep taking it of its case, which will surely lessen the life of it or just deal with it.5 stars if they could figure out a case that maybe you could just figure that out.Has anybody had success with using this in a docking/charger/speaker station and not having to remove the case?

My only complaint, hence four stars, is that the rubber becomes more pliable over time. So now after 18 months of use, it does not fit snugly on my phone. So when I take it off to wipe down my phone, it takes a while to get it installed properly on my phone.To solve the sliding car dash issue, I bought a front window phone holder that I keep permanently in my truck.

This one has some shortcomings. It's a hard case so there's little protection from drops. The case won't slide over the phone with a screen protector on as it's too snug. The case insists on sliding between the screen protector and the phone, essentially peeling off the screen protector. Finally gave up on applying a screen protector after this happened repeatedly.Also - one big shortcoming w/this case as well as the Commuter, which I three of -- somebody at Otterbox completely overlooked the fact that people like to plug in lots of different varieties of ear buds to listen to music. They must have tested this with one brand that has a really narrow pin to plug in. We have yet to find ANY earbuds that will plug into the case w/o modifying the case. I ended up having to bore out the earphone jack hole on all three of the cases so my kids can listen to music w/o completely removing the case. What a nuisance!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review133" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-08:</strong> It was a good case but both I got ended up cracking at the bottom where the connector went in.

The mostly plastic outer shell on the commuter offers a little less protection but slides in and out tons easier. Another point of interest is the defender series restricts a little of your signal strength being so thick. I tested this theory standing side by side next to a friend both having 4s phones on the same carrier and my phone was one bar less in strength than my friend.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review135" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-04:</strong> Well it's an Otterbox, build quality is great and protects your phone as advertised.

She has had many cases over the years and has never cracked any of them (she is a gentle child!)  She usually wears out the print pattern on the outside of the cases due to use!  With only a 30 day return policy now this item can't be returned!  This is unusual for an &#34;Otterbox&#34;' named product.I love Amazon for their amazing way that they stand behind their products but not this time!  I will go back to buying cheaper and well build cases from Monoprice, Ebay etc from now on.  My advice is to spend your hard earned $$ elsewhere for a case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review138" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-22:</strong> This case is of lighter weight and slicker on the outside than the Defender is - it also does not have the big clip like the Defender has, either, so this case with your phone can slip into your pocket. The part you touch is mainly the plastic which is smooth. It will not fit in the Defender clip since it is much less thick / wide.This has covers for the openings in the phone like the Defender, but no cover over the &#34;silent&#34; switch. There is also a cut-out for the earpiece / user-facing camera and the &#34;home&#34; button. The screen protector is thinner and easier to use to operate your phone features or play games.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review139" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-22:</strong> I have seen her drop her phone on more than one occasion and is constantly thanking her Otterbox for saving it.

I love that it comes with a screen protector cause that way you don't have to buy it seperatly. The silicon layer is not really for protection, its just so the second layer doesn't ruin the phone. And then the polycarbonate is a strong layer that protects the phone very well. If you drop your phone, the screen will not crack because the case takes in all the impact. Unlike other very protective cases, this one isn't very wide which is great. It easily fits in my pocket. What I do not like though is the apple logo on the back of the phone is uncovered. It gets dirty and finger marks so I wish they covered it like in the defender series. For anyone looking for a great deal of a case that protects the phone, and still doesn't make it hard to fit in your pocket, this is definitely the best case out there and I highly recommend it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review153" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-17:</strong> I don't know if Otterbox will like this review, but I'm going to write it, anyway.I bought this case back in November.  Everything about it has been just fine.The case is not too big, but one can definitely feel that it provides nice protection.  My only complaint is that I wish they did collegiate colors.I have grown somewhat clumsy in my dotage, and have dropped my iPhone 4S a couple of times.  Those drops have produced nary a scratch or crack in the glass.Well, about a month ago, the top lip of the hardshell developed a crack.  I have no idea why.  I kept the phone in my pants pocket, so that could explain the issue.  Then, after about 3 weeks, the top hardshell lip broke completely off.I made a warranty claim with Otterbox (via their website).  They sent me a couple of e-mails to confirm that I was an actual Otterbox owner, and then a few more e-mails.And then I received a brand new case in the mail today!Wow!  What customer service!!!Truth be told, this is about the third time Otterbox has treated me this way.  I have a couple of iPod waterproof boxes (that I swim laps with - ugh), and when those started to barely leak, Otterbox replaced them for me.

I borrowed her phone occasionally, and I enjoyed it too. It was well designed with enough padding to protect the iPhone, and the rubberized grip made it easy to hold. But after a couple of years of use and abuse, the screen cover was badly scratched, and the case was dropped one time too many and cracked. So we shopped around for another OtterBox and chose the Commuter Series case. If anything, it's an improvement over the old OtterBox. It's noticeably smaller and less bulky, and it's easier to insert the iPhone 4.All of the necessary openings are there, including the camera flash. The case has rubberized grips in the areas where your hand holds the phone. Unlike some cases we've seen, the opening for the charger plug is big enough to allow the plug to be pushed in without any difficulty. And the case looks good.Overall, the OtterBox case is an attractive case that fits the iPhone 4 perfectly and provides excellent protection for the phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review182" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-16:</strong> Otterbox is the absolute best case for cell phones.

The screen protector doesn't seat completely, and it is very shiny. It's a pain to see in an office setting or outside. The case also catches a tremendous amount of dirt/grossness. It gets under the screen protector and can be felt scratching the screen under the &#34;protector&#34;. My 4S actually had more damage from being in the case than without. The rubber protection around the hard plastic shell rips and tears easily at spots where you would open it (vibrate buttion, charging port, etc).While it did survive some nasty drops, I wish I got a Lifeproof (who was recently purchased by Otterbox). Spend the extra money and get the Lifeproof case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review185" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-23:</strong> Saved my phone!!!

I was turned on to Otterbox last year for my Blackberry, and it worked like a charm.  After upgrading to an iPhone 4S, I did research online, checked many reviews, tried out cases in the store, and found the Otterbox Commuter to be the right one for me.It has a silicon inner case, with a hard plastic outer case.  I prefer the hard plastic outer, since its easier to get in and out of my pocket.  The rubber corners are a great trick for impact protection, although you won't find me doing drop tests off the roof of my car to the asphalt below.The clear plastic screen that came with the case was easy to apply and I can't even tell its on.My DW has been using the Otterbox Defender on her phone, which is fine for a purse person, but since my phone goes in my pants pocket, this slimmer version works for me.  From a fashion perspective, it seems to project the original shape and form of the iPhone, instead of masking it behind a much larger case.The ports on this phone, from which I primarily use just the charger, are easy to access and seem to get gunk like lint out of the connector.  I see myself keeping this case for the lifetime of my phone.Overall, I'm completely pleased.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review192" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-27:</strong> Great color, and price was good.

It might not be the slimmest one around, nor the most glamorous looking but if you're a klutz, like me, it is WORTH IT! I am tall and therefore the height I drop it from is significant enough to do serious damage to the phone without a case or a flimsier case. I can attest to this because after almost two years of ownership, it has developed a small crack (the case, not the phone!) from all the dropping.I can fit it into my back pocket, it's not insanely huge and the silicone allows it to be grippier and prevent it from sliding all over smooth surfaces. It also increases the shock absorption and distribution when you drop it. A hard case can crack on impact and ruin your phone, a soft one might not be protection enough, this has both things.One thing that was kind of annoying, but something I anticipated after watching a review on youtube about this case, is that the silicone flap that over the charge port doesn't close all the way and the fact that the plastic portion might have a slightly imperfect fit over the silicone. You will get over this very quickly, it is not bothersome enough to interfere with anything. I'm pretty OCD about this stuff and I don't even notice it anymore.It is easy to take the phone in and out of the case and while for the most part your phone will be left with no marks, I DID end up having slight marks on the metal band around the phone where the volume and power buttons are. This is part of normal wear and tear, I'm not too concerned.I've dropped my phone off tables, couches, onto linoleum and cement and it's been just fine in this case. It's a worthy investment!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review194" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-01-07:</strong> Practically everyone has an otterbox for their iPhone, so I figured I'd give it a shot, in hopes of protecting my brand new phone 4S. When I first got this case I was really pleased with it. It fit very nicely and also looked nice. The first drop the plastic cracked at the top corner near the ear bud jack. It did protect the phone, but the case got loose on that top corner. Then I took it off to put a screen protector on and went to put it back on and you have to bend the plastic on the case a little to get it over the top rubber buttons covering the ear bud jack and on button. I did this and the whole upper third of the case snapped off. Now i put the case on successfully two or three other times before, but this time it snapped. And looking at it the plastic is very thin and cheap, probably why it cracked the first time I dropped it. It's a nice case that looks good, but the plastic is made way too cheaply. I'd rather just be careful with my phone and get a cheaper, less bulky bumper case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review195" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-28:</strong> I really liked this case.

The cover fits snugly and the inner piece protects the screen if dropped face down on the floor--which I have managed to "test" already! I have a white iPhone and as good as this case looks, I was still concerned about the inner white rubber piece getting dirty (it surrounds the front), particularly from face make-up; unfortunately that did happen and I am no longer using this case because of it.

At least for this case that wasn't true. The first time the case broke, the plastic cracked off and shattered my phone. Otterbox replaced the case because they figured it was defective. I got the replacement and while it helped keep it from damage several times (I will give credit where credit's due) one time it fell out of my pocket it dropped shattering the case and my phone's back screen to pieces. I contacted Otterbox and while they wanted to send me another case, I wasn't about to take my chances on another case and having to come out of pocket a third time for a shattered screen.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review233" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-07:</strong> This case was described as fitting the 4S and it does...mostly.  The headphone jack cut out does not line up and the top off/on switch is very very hard to engage.  I had to use a hard object like the blunt end of a ball point pen to engage the button.  I suspect it is not lined up exact.  In addition, I could not dock my phone with the i radio dock with this case on unless I used a dock extender and that is a pain in the what ever.  I found the hard shell part of the case to be a very uncomfortable fit for my hands.  It feels almost slick.  I have at best average sized hands for a woman and this case made me feel like the phone was going to squirt out of my hands.  I cannot address the protection aspect of this case, it may be fine, but I cannot recommend it to anyone who has smaller hands.  I purchased an Incipio casse from Amazon (see my review) and like it much better.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review234" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-07:</strong> one and only case my husband will use I think I may need to get one as well, the defender has some quirks so since he loves this I may try it</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review235" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-07-05:</strong> nothing like the original otterbox.  its smaller design makes it more desirable, but it doesnt hold up.

The first inner layer is a robust silicone material which is durable and absorbs impact force along with the outer hard plastic layer that fits tightly. Most of the buttons: power, volume, headset input and the 30-pin plug are covered with the silicone. The camera and flash are given a wider window for easier cleaning for dust and debris and for picture clarity.  One poor note - the headphone 3.5mm plug is covered with the hole on the wrong side.The feel of the otter box is a little less slippery than most and definitely less bulky. It's really just a series of thin, but tough skins over your phone. There is no doubt that you can drop this and feel protected. The hard plastic outer sheath does not completely cover your iPhone like the others. Instead it has cut-outs to give just as much protection without excessive cove rage. It's simply better designed than previous models. Check out the price on other models and you'll see that this is on the lower end, but it doesn't skimp on quality.It also comes with a separate plastic clear cover along with a cleaning cloth and an installation card for those bubbles. YOUTUBE has some great videos of how to easily apply these covers without any bubbles or trouble.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review263" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-19:</strong> I love the colors of this OtterBox, but the white part gets dirty fast.

This otter box was designed to be a skinnier than all the other otter boxes but still have great protection. It feels good in your hands and is not hard to fit in your pocket. I gave this otter box  4 stars only because it doesn't come with a built in screen protector and is easy to get scratches on the screen if dropped. So I do recommend you buy a separate screen protector and you can see it in one of my reviews.

It provides a nice level of protection while still fitting in a typical uniform shirt pocket.  I found the Defender case to be too thick and rubbery to permit one to easily insert and remove the iPhone from a shirt or pants pocket.There is a little design flaw with this case, hence the four star rating.  The plastic frame at the bottom of the case in front of the docking port is a little too thin.  After putting this in my pocket upside down for ten days, the plastic piece in front of the docking port split in half.  It is just too thin to be tugged on when removing the case (and iPhone) from a pocket.  The piece at the top of the cover spans the entire depth of the iPhone and doesn't seem to be prone to the same cracking.  So, as long as you pull the phone out of a pocket by the top of this case, you should be fine.  My Defender case now sits in my nightstand.Otterbox quickly replaced the broken case once I contacted them under their one-year warranty program.Great price and Amazon Prime is an added bonus.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review267" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-14:</strong> I loved my case it was not what I expected it was WAY better.

It really fits the phone well, covers all the buttons as it should, and definitely feels secure in the event of dropping and such.  The color choice SUCKS.  The silicone part of the case is white and I dont think the couldve thought of a worse color.  It is CONSTANTLY FILTHY.  I'm not a dirty person, but I am a female that wears some makeup (as most do), so the case gets dirty from that. So unless you plan on holding the phone an inch from your face you will end up with a makeup covered case that doesnt come off.  And don't even think of putting it in jeans--- it will turn blue.  Pretty much anything and everything gets stuck to the white silicone and it looks disgusting.  I've had this phone about 2 weeks and I've already purchased a new different one because I cannot stand the look of it.  So if you dont mind a dirty case/don't wear makeup or jeans.... go ahead and get it! The quality is great besides the dirt factor!Oh and the bottom cover for the charger doesn't stay tucked under-- so that can sometimes get annoying as well.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review270" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-04:</strong> This otter box is slim and stylish!

As someone else mentioned in their review the silicon piece was very flimsy.  I've had other Otterbox cases and the silicon piece on this one was very weak. I'm usually very careful with my phone but I was holding my phone and something else in my hand one day and my son grabbed that other thing out of my hand and there went my phone on the floor.  It fell from a distance of MAYBE 3.5 feet on to a wood floor and the plastic around the camera piece cracked and the whole corner cracked.  My phone was ok but the case was not.  I guess I would have expected the case to survive a drop of 3.5 feet seeing how their website says it's "Impact Resistant". I did keep the silicon piece and used it inside of another Otterbox plastic housing but it was too big/loose and the other plastic housing couldn't quite fit around it.  So...take that for what you will.  Leads me to believe it's not an authentic OtterBox.  But I'm not an expert and that's just my opinion</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review277" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-26:</strong> I really dig this case.  I originally considered an Otterbox Defender, but after comparing Defender and Commuter cases in the store, it looks like the Defender is about 1/8 to 3/16&#34; bigger in every dimension, including thickness.  I wanted it protected, but I didn't want it in a bubble.  Also, my wife as a 3GS defender, and the rainbow effect on the screen was unattractive.So I instead went with the commuter and a Zagg invisibleSHIELD case-friendly screen protector.  Let's just talk about the Otterbox, though:The silicone portion is not the gummy/sticky kind.  It's got a bit of rigidity to it, fits the phone correctly, and covers the charge port and headphone jack that flip back for easy access.  The silent/ring switch is exposed.  Volume/power buttons are covered and there are tactile bumps on their place.  The cameras (front and back) and home button are all totally exposed, which you can see in the pictures.  Also, a cut-out for the Apple logo is (amusingly) on the back as well so you can tell it's not one of those evil Android devices I've read about (I kid).It would have been nice if the volume + and - buttons were labeled, but up is above down.  Not a huge deal.  I find the sleep/power button difficult to press.  There's a lot of &#34;give&#34; to that button that wasn't there previously.  I took the phone back out of the case to make sure I hadn't broken the button or something (I hadn't).  Again, you get used to it and it's not a huge deal.  You learn to apply more pressure and just press on one side of the button instead of the middle.The outer plastic part is slick.  Literally.  I picked the phone up for the first time and it immediately slipped out of my hands and landed on the carpeted floor.  Easy to slide in and out of your pocket, but I wish it had a soft-touch texture or something on the sides to make it more of a sure thing to hold.It's kind of like an inside-out Defender, as the soft silicone is on the inside and the hard plastic is on the outside.  The Defender, as noted above, is silicone on the outside.Still, despite all my complaints, I feel that my phone is protected and secure without feeling super-big and bulky.  It adds maybe 3mm in each dimension (height, width, depth).  If you need less thickness, I'd argue that you are not really protecting your phone.  If you want more thickness, the Defender is there for you.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review278" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-03:</strong> The case is great although it does not come with a screen protector or in a brand new case but it works great and is in awesome condition.

I do have a speck candyshell case that I like and fits well and does also have the larger cutout for the camera and flash but it does not cover all the ports.  I found that during my sons little league games dust gets in these areas so I bought this case.While I like the look and feel of the case I find that the fit isn't great.  The polycarbonate shell does not fit correctly in the cutouts in the rubber.  This causes a problem for the cover for the charging port.  I have to try to bend the polycarbonate piece so that the cover will stay.  It works ok, but definitely doesn't look as good as it does on the video review I watched on otter box.I have a couple of the otterbox defenders for the iPhone 4.  While they fit well, they cause a haze in the flash and the rubber outer layer has stretched out and I always struggle to get the cover for the charging port to stay put.I like that the commuter is easy to get in and out of my pocket like the speck candyshell does and there isn't a lot of added bulk.  The defender is a struggle to get in and out of your poket.  You do loose the grip created by the rubber outer layer on the defender.  The outer layer on the commuter is pretty slick.  It would be nice if it had a bit of grip.Overall, I'm pretty happy with this case, but I wish that it fit better.  I hope that my solution to getting the charging cover to stay put lasts...Update:  after just a couple of days the outer shell of this case cracked.  I contacted Otterbox and they responded immediately.  I provided a little information to them and they are sending me a replacement.  Excellent customer service!!!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review281" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-12-29:</strong> The phone case itself is great. Love the way it fits, love the protection. The yellow did change colors shortly after purchasing, the visible yellow is now a dingy color, almost a light gray.

I originally bought one that was sturdier as I was so concerned about dropping my new iphone. The sturdier one is great and very protective but bulky and heavy so I decided to try this one and I love it.  I haven't dropped my phone but I feel the product would prevent serious damage to the phone.  I did add a screen shield and I'm very happy I did that to protect the screen.  If you really want to give your phone the most protection then the sturdier cover is the one you would want as it completely encloses the phone inside the case and no need for a screen protector since it's built into the case.  But if you want a good cover that's less bulky this one is the way to go.Also, this brand is not that easy to find in the retail stores and the selection is very limited.  The salesperson at the Apple store recommended this brand but they don't carry it.  Go figure.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review286" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-01:</strong> This is my first time buying a non Defender style OtterBox. It's certainly worth the money here on Amazon. My only complaint is that the rubberized parts of the case sometimes get out of place on the face of the phone. I'll most likely opt for the Defender series again once this case runs its course.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review287" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-01-15:</strong> I have had an iPhone for about 3 years now and have gone through so many cases. I've had the iFrogz Luxe Case, SwitchEasy CapsuleRebel M Menace Hybrid Case, and the Agent18 EcoShield Slider; my boyfriend also had the Otterbox Defender. Although each of these cases has perks, they all have drawbacks. I see many more pros with the Commuter Series from OtterBox than I have seen with any other iPhone case.For starters, the case is not bulky. When comparing it to the Defender, it wins hands down. The defender was awkward, bulky, and came with a holster clip that most girls won't use. Yes, this case would be handy if you were possibly in the construction business or if you really had a problem with dropping your phone, but for my needs, it didn't fit the bill. The Commuter case has a soft inside and a hard exterior, and they come in two different colors. This is both appealing and functional. The soft rubber casing allows for a no-slip grip and shock absorber and the hard shell keeps it from being too sticky. It is comfortable in the hand and provides the perfect balance of rubber to hard shell casing.I have dropped my phone a few times and the case has held up well, I can't see any wear on it. However, I have noticed that the soft shell (my color is yellow) does show discoloration. My hard shell is gray and you can see gray spots all throughout my yellow case. While this is not a big deal to me, it is just something I thought was worth mentioning. The Commuter Series in my opinion is superior to all other iPhone cases I have owned and, for $22, I think it's worthy of protecting the iPhone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review288" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-30:</strong> My mom LOVES her otterbox. It looks nice and the colors are perfect for her. The only downfall, which is kinda important, is the white softer portion is already discoloring (from absorbing the dirt from our hands). This is an awesome case, and I highly recommend an otterbox, it doesn't add much bulk, keeps the headphone and charging ports protected from dust, but keep the coloring in mind when ordering (mom got the purple/white one if it doesn't say that anywhere, I ordered the blue with a lighter blue softer shell, mine is showing discoloring too, but less noticeable because its not white). I definitely recommend the case, just make sure you think about your coloring!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review289" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-18:</strong> If you know anything about the Otterbox cases, is that they are generally ugly. I am thinking that they received reviews and noticed this too as they are now coming out with more attractive and less bulkier cases with the same protection. This case is awesome, it has great protection, isn't as bulky, and looks nice.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review290" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-03-18:</strong> I got the Commuter Otterbox case the day before my new iPhone 4s came. I've been debating for a few days on whether to get the Defender or the Commuter and after doing some research, I have decided to get the Commuter. The Defender is nice and seems super durable, but honestly I do not drop my phone that often and I am usually good with my phones, except for the occasional accidents I drop it every once in awhile. Also, the Defender is too bulky for my taste. One reason I got the iPhone was for its sleekness and the Defender would have ruined that feature for me. Since I do not want to compromise the sleekness of the phone, but also want great protection and knowing I take good care of my phones, the Commuter seemed like a good compromise.I will admit, putting on the case took a bit of effort first. You definitely have to "massage" the phone in the case a little since you are trying to make it line up with all the buttons/switches with the silicone case and the hard plastic cover. I am a perfectionist so when I saw that it was not lining up correctly, I kept fidgeting with it or took the phone out and tried it all over again. The trick is to slide the bottom part in first and then press on the top part to snap it into place (just like the video on otterbox.com) Before I was doing the opposite so I felt kind of dumb that I did not just look at the video first (haha). I can reach all of the buttons and switches fine and the flaps for the usb/charger connector and the headphones stay in place when I tuck them in. I can see some people with big fingers having trouble trying to switch the silence on/off, so keep that in mind if it is a big deal for you.I am not really sure why some reviewers said their case is not lining up correctly with their phone or the phone just does not fit with the case. I am looking at my phone with the case on and it is all secure and tight. I do not have the screen protector that came with it on, but I am sure I will need to soon so I do not regret it later.Like I said before, if you're clumsy, just get the Defender and you will not have to worry about your phone at all. If you are usually mindful with your phone, get the Commuter. I have not dropped my phone on concrete or anything like that yet (fingers crossed!) but if I do end up letting it happen, I will update!UPDATE!Ok, so I've had this case for a little over a month and my iPhone is still sitting pretty in it. I just dropped my phone today on tile when it slipped out of my hands because I was fiddling around with my handbag. Oh my god was I happy that nothing happened to my phone or case! I still say this case is a great buy, I mean 20 bucks to protect a $200 phone is pretty nice! I'm never letting this phone out of its case when I'm out. If it wasn't for this case, my phone will be shattered!Only negatives about this case is it takes a bit to get the phone to fit in the case, but you get used to it after a few times. Also, the lock/unlock button and volume buttons are somewhat hard to press down easily since the silicone covers them, but you get used to that as well.Happy hunting for the right case everyone!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review291" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-25:</strong> Was so happy to find this at the price I did.

Just what I was looking for. It's a 2 piece system. A high quality siliconized rubber(not the sticky lint collector type) fits tight around your phone but still lets everything function properly. Then a plastic shield clamps around the top, bottow and sides but still lets the rubber show in the corners. This allows great grip with slippery fingers. The whole thing is low profile and slides in my pocket with ease. Great fit and function and plenty of quality to last up to abuse.

While using this otterbox case, I placed my phone on top of my Mustang's roof and took off down the road (absent minded mom). The phone flipped off the roof and landed in the street and was run over by the other cars behind me. I watched the rear view window in horror as it jumped off the pavement as each car went over it. There was not a scratch on my iPhone. I kid not. It only powered itself down. The case was smashed a little but still usable. I emailed otterbox to tell them about his amazing story and they simply wanted to replace the case for me for free. ???? Seriously? Saved my phone AND a free replacement? So I get a new case and SURE enough, I did it again. Again, it was run over several times (same busy street). This time, tire marks on the front of the case, and pavement pits on the back. Still, my iPhone was unharmed. Just powered itself down. I just bought another OB case to replace my cracked case - Otterbox would have replaced it again, but seriously, I'll gladly buy another from them.

The Otterbox Commuter Series Hybrid case fits nicely in all my pockets but it's certainly not tough. It crack while in my pocket when I sat down after 7 months of ownership. I must have sat in such a way that it contorted the case and stressed the corner which is where the brittle plastic snapped. Prior to that I was disappointed that the rubber that goes around the screen is thin and flimsy and it would often come off or get stuck under the lip of the case. That issue got worse over time. On the plus side this case is easy to put together and has a nice firm feel to it. I dropped my phone twice but both times it was from a short distance onto carpet so that wasn't a very good drop test.  The case doesn't at all interfere with the usage of my phone but in spite of a few good qualities I won't be purchasing it again. My dad has the Otterbox Defender series case and it's an extremely tough and protective case but it adds considerable bulk to the phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review316" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-15:</strong> Not a bad case, but the harder shell (gray) broke after about 4 months.

Luckily, he was using the same model otterbox, so his iphone stayed protected but the otterbox was pretty mangled.  After seeing the amount of protection otterboxes provide, my father asked me to get him the same one, just in a different color.  Shipped using Amazon Prime, so he got it in 2 days and it was exactly what he wanted.  It's the perfect amount of protection without making the phone too bulky, and it can (obviously) withstand a beating.  Would highly reccomend this for someone looking to get great protection without sacrificing too much of the phone's slim profile.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review320" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-01-05:</strong> Great price on Amazon.

The last otterbox pulled out my hair, was impossible to remove from pockets, and so bulky. This case is perfect, hard shell with rubber sides. Have dropped my phone half a dozen times, some from high up, not scratches or harm done to the phone. Fits most of my cables, some after market (other otterbox did NOT do this, had to buy Apple cables).Not completely covering as with other otterbox, so theres a drawback but much more functional. Only difference it made for me is not being able to carry it in the rain without covering it, which in Arizona, is not much of a problem.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review322" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-07:</strong> Bought this for the wife's phone or my daughter's phone...

Not from impact or damage, but from general wear.  The wear occurs mainly around the flap for the power cable connection (it will eventually wear out/tear off), and the hard plastic shell (which is cracking across the top of my iPhone).Otterbox will replace fully if in warranty, but that takes time, and I have just about given up at this point.  Instead I keep rebinding cracked plastic with epoxy.  Hopefully this case will last a few months more as I passed my 2 year contract and am kind of waiting to see what the iPhone 6 will be.That being said, I do like the Otterbox case style and will continue to purchase similar cases from them moving forward.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review332" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-20:</strong> Pros:Good protection - not just a thin plastic cover that provides only scratch protection, but something to absorb shock from a fallA quality made product which fits well (after some wrestling to get it on)Cons:I could to without the giant "Otter" logo on the backSilicone IS a lint magnet - there's just no getting around that fact</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review333" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-22:</strong> This is a nice case, but the white piece is porous and it picks up dirt and dust quickly.

Although the defender case provides great protection, it has flaws; so when it was time to replace it I decided to purchase this commuter series case.Although this case does not provide the same level of protection as the defender series case, I believe it is adequate for most, and excels in areas that the defender falls short.  This case is slimmer and better looking (in my opinion), it's not a lent magnet (the defender is), and the hard plastic exterior allows it to slid in and out of your pocket easily (I huge plus for me).The biggest draw back is that the buttons that are covered by the case sleep/power button and volume up/down are very difficult to press with this case on. My hope is that it will become easier as it is broken in.  Also the screen protector that was included with mine did not go on very well. It does appear to be a good quality screen protector and is easy to install, but the top portion (above the front facing camera) will not stick down properly, as if it does not have adhesive on that area. I don't think this is a design flaw, I think I just got a bad one.So overall I'm happy with the protection and the look of the case, but only time will tell if the buttons function better after break in. If they do, great! if not I can live with it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review341" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-30:</strong> Hey this otterbox case is good.

It does exactly what it claims to do and that goes a long way! Easy to handle and won't stick inside pockets. When the case cracked prior to the 1 year warranty expiring, I simply took pictures proving the damage claim and OtterBox sent a new case out almost immediately. Since the case comes with a protective film for the screen, I was able to completely change out my case and start new again. So rest assured, that even if this case fails (which it shouldn't), you have solid customer service and support, which is another thing they claim, but it's true!Be advised though, the protective film that comes with this case is extremely reflective, but it yields the clearest/cleanest screen when in appropriate lighting. Outside, forget it, you're going to have problems, but it's still very protective and fits just fine.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review345" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-20:</strong> Great case.

After reading all the positive reviews and YouTube videos I decided on this one. It didn't come at a blazing speed but I didn't bother getting mad at that.-First impressions were that it was easy to install but was bulkier than advertised but not by too much. Just don't think it's going to retain a sleek look. Was pretty happy with it until I realized it won't fit in a dock at all and the headphones won't go in. Was still not going to freak out cause I figured it was the price to pay for protecting my awesome phone.-Fast forward a couple weeks. Found a few new annoyances. 1)The snap in protector for the charging slot won't stay in. 2) The lip on the side gets in the way in landscape mode when texting/gaming (kind of). 3) when I pulled off the case I realized that the silicone is letting in (and trapping) all kinds of dirt and grime. Now I pull it off every couple of days and soak the case in soapy water for a while. Also it just looks like a redneck or a child's case compared to how everyone else has their phone.- So to wrap it up finally.. Unless all you're after is paranoia protection and nothing else, show off your phone a little more and get a wrap and bumper or slim case. Apple is a much better designer than otterbox and it'll get just as dirty with or without it. Btw, the good thing about the case is that it DOES FIT THE 4S, and looks like it would actually help if dropped but I don't know from experience ....</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review348" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-28:</strong> GREAT case.

The commuter series is a little less heavy duty than some of their other series, but it allows a slim profile for those who carry their phone in their pocket.  Also, I've dropped my phone plenty of times and the Commuter case hasn't let me down.  It offers plenty of protection against drops, is somewhat water resistant (not totally submergible, but will hold up if you spill a drink on it), and is easy to install.  The case also comes with a screen protector which is excellent since it means you don't have to order one separately.

The teal color is gorgeous, not too blue or green, but a true teal/tourquoise. It looks great on mywhite iphone, but would also pop on the black phone since the color is so vibrant . The case fits the phone perfectly, and is comfortable to hold.  It's smooth, which makes it easy to get in and out of handbag pockets, but not slippery at all. This case cradles the phone on all four corners, back and sides while allowing easy access to all the control buttons.

I think they all take away from the sleek looks of an expensive phone.  I haven't  found any case  that improves the look of my phone.  But, it's difficult  to rationalize the feeling when you drop your phone and you know it's going to shatter.  In that brief moment in time, your pulse quickens and your BP rises.  You break out in a sweat and you remember having  looked at cases and thinking, &#34;I'll just be extra careful,&#34; knowing quite well that you really should have used protection....All this takes place in one or two seconds.  And then reality hits:  You pick up the phone and see the glass.  It's like having your puppy run over by a car...sickening.  So you spend a hundred dollars or so to get your screen replaced, and the same day you pick out a durable case like you should have done in the beginning.  Do yourself a favor and buy this case before it's too late.  The Otterbox Commuter will not improve your phone's looks but it isn't as clunky and the Defender series.  You need it, you know it, now buy it .</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review373" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-17:</strong> Bought this case, Great case does what it is supposed to do, fits very well.

I would buy the case again because it's cute, and it protects the phone very well, but the only down side to it is that it gets dirty quickly.

I do like the box and that is is not too bullky.  Easy to put on and seems that it will give adequate protection for the average user. Now if you are the type to bike, or such and talk on phone, then the defender might the your box.  The only caveat is the provided screen protector. It works but when you have the phone off you can see some bubbles (tiny) and maybe any other imperfections. With the screen on you see none of this.  Also it does not seem to degrade any use of the screen so that is a plus .I may later look into a Zagg protector.  I've heard pro and cons whether they are needed at all. The new glass if almost unscratchable anyway.  The apple guys at the store say that if if makes you feel better do it but that unless you drop it on a rock on its face or allow the face to hit something your not gonna get broke. And the glass if extremely scratch proof. So I guess that part is up to us.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review381" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-01:</strong> Much sleeker and nicer looking than the old style otterbox.

I loved how it kept a slim profile that was easy to hold, and the cases look sharp, and they show the Apple logo through the back.  They also did not affect photo taking, and gave free access to the main button below the screen.My phone also survived a drop or two using this case.However after several months of use, and using a pocket to carry the phone while at work, I found that the silicone would get a little stretched out, just enough to where at times taking it out of my pocket would pull the corner of the case off.  Its also, like any silicone case, became difficult to keep clean and fresh-looking with the lighter colors.  Because of the loosening of the case, I switched to the Otterbox Defender and am liking that much more, despite the slightly more bulky size.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review383" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-08:</strong> I like it but the only problem with this item is, the white part gets so dirty and you can't clean it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review384" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-20:</strong> This case protects my iPhone wonderfully.

It provides me with sufficient protection for my iPhone without adding too much bulk.I had the OtterBox Defender Series case before this one, and while that case probably does offer a bit more protection, it adds a LOT of bulk. And, I also did not like the OtterBox Defender Series case's port covers. Specifically, the main port cover at the bottom of the case. It was always very difficult to get it to close properly, and I eventually just cut it off with a pair of scissors.Now, with that said, while I found this Commuter Series case to provide ample protection for me, IF you are someone who frequently drops their phone, you may still want to consider the Defender Series case, as again, it is clearly a much beefier case.For me, this OtterBox Commuter Series case is perfect. It is designed very well, it fits the iPhone 4/4S perfectly, and I do feel that it provides me with sufficient protection. I've owned quite a few different iPhone cases, and so far this case is my favorite.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review392" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-16:</strong> This is my second commuter case for my 4s.  The first one I had broke near the bottom(the thin piece over the 30pin connection) so I needed a replacement quick.  I decided to use the black silicon from my previous commuter with this ocean blue hard shell cause that combination looked better.  But beware, if you have a thick screen protector it might not fit perfectly cause these for some reason the newer commuters' are more stiff(which is good) than older commuter cases.  I've had my black commuter case for a little over a year and its a lot softer than this one.  I use the TechArmor Privacy Screen Protector and it didn't fit right with this combination.  With the black silicon it worked fine.  It could have just been the stiff silicon.  Maybe after wearing it out a little it'll fit better.  Still a great product.Oh and it did include original packaging and screen protector.  My black commuter was from the Verizon store-VZ packaging and no screen protector.  And more expensive.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review393" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-05:</strong> Came super fast, and even though I thought the white part of the case would of been the hard part rather than the purple (just so when putting it into my jean pockets it wouldn't turn colors) but i like it either way.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review394" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-09:</strong> I got this case because everyone in my family has an iphone.

We finished by using Goo-gone and that saved it from more damage.  Also the front was not quite wide enough to slide under the cover on all four corners, so one long side is really not tucked into the case that well.

It has a nice form factor, appears very well made, and provides ample protection, including a small bumper which protrudes to protect the screen, which I consider essential and is missing from many other &#34;slim&#34; cases.  (Admittedly I never dropped my phone in the case so I can't vouch for it being as protective as it appears.)  Unfortunately I do have some quibbles which makes me unable to recommend this case for the $20 I paid for it.1) The case is actually two separate parts, a silicone inner section and a hard plastic shell.  This is a somewhat awkward system and I wonder about it's purpose as it doesn't appear that you could use either part separately, so why make them as separate pieces.  In any case, it makes putting your phone into the case MUCH more difficult.  It took me probably ten minutes to get my phone lodged in there properly, and I was worried all the while that something was going to rip.  If you dont change cases often this isn't a huge deal but it is bothersome.2) The hard plastic shell is oddly slippery.  I know this doesn't seem too bad, but considering how often I'm holding my phone I could easily imagine it being a sizable annoyance.3)  This is more of a recommendation, it looks terrible if you're using it with a white phone (If it's the black case.)  I thought it might look good but it was actually very unattractive to have the black case with my white ipod.  My personal opinion (although my girlfriend agreed.)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005SUHRVC" id="B005SUHRVC-review419" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-02:</strong> I would so buy a norther one.

Cheaper than buying them individually. They are the knock off type and not original bumpers but I have never bought original bumpers. Items look exactly as in the first picture and fit the iPhone 4s also.edit: I've used most of these and I gave away the not so male colors. I must mention that these do not last anywhere near as long as original ones and they do discolor after time as the rubber comes in contact with jeans etc. But that's basically what you pay for: minimal yet attractive protection.

I believe that the AT&T; version uses a different processor which may give higher performance on AT&T;'s own LTE networks (will still work on any GSM network anywhere), but if you are outside the USA I would return it and ask for what was ordered.Note that these phones originate from many countries (that's how they get the price down), so that you may get an instruction manual in Turkish or some other language that you don't speak.

Music player will play all the sound files in the phone including ring tone, audio files from whatsapp (need to create playlist, not easy if you have thousands of song need to sort)5. Phone will freeze randomly and no respond while pressing the home or lock key (could end up rebooting or need to wait for awhile to respond)6. Build in keyboard lagging, always delay for over a second7. Overheat!!!!! the bottom of the phone can become extremely hot while using the phone8. Phone call log showing all the calls and messages, need to fliter it every time9. Not supporting multi language coding, if you select Chinese as the phone language, phone will not display Japanese characters or other language (English is fine) in songs; if select English as system language, you won't able to read any other language characters10.

When I email Hong Kong customer service, they said I had to bring the phone to the service department in Hong Kong12.

Videos all stream and play nicely, same with Netflix and amazon instant. 100000s of apps, super faster, I sometimes lag on subway surfers but otherwise it's flawless. Works with all of my email accounts. The sole problem is without even using any app my phone dies 6 hours into the day. This is really sad to me. So basically if I play a game or watch a two hour movie on the phone it will be down to 50%. Also, I know that there are extended battery's out there but I dont want to ruin the sleek this of my phone by adding a fat back to it? Get my drift?4 stars for the phone's feature-1 star for the crap battery life.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00812YWXU" id="B00812YWXU-review29" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-02:</strong> buy it thinking it was original samsung but left very disappointed to see that it was nothing more than a cheap copy which to buy original price. lo compre creyendo que era original de samsung pero quede muy decepcionada al ver que no era mas que una copia barata la cual compre a precio de original!!!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00812YWXU" id="B00812YWXU-review30" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-05:</strong> great device I used , leter I changed to S4 because im a tech person, but my wife still use it and it just works great!!!!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00812YWXU" id="B00812YWXU-review31" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-12:</strong> It's brand new as described, loves it, works perfectly and it is absolutely a very nice looking phone, it's functional and it has a very high quality screen.absolutely recomend this phone is a fine piece of art!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00812YWXU" id="B00812YWXU-review32" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-09-25:</strong> Excellent as expected.Very fast phone and the best Android phone so far. I already installed Jelly Bean and I'm loving it.For buyers GT-I9300 or international version is the quad core but it only have 1gb of ram. I noticed that it consumes a lot of battery if you use most of the features like sensor, wifi, gps and gaming. Just maximize your battery by turning on all power saving features, lower the brightness of the screen and use dark wall paper. I hope I don't encounter any problem with the phone since it's been excellent so far.I noticed though that upon unlocking your device when you press the power button the screen has a delay and will not lit up immediately unlike other HTC phones that I have.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00812YWXU" id="B00812YWXU-review33" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-13:</strong> Seller wanted to rid this product. Although it worked, sensor of phone (bottom left)doesn't work well. This is the same side of the phone where the main call button is! Problem 2, the port on this phone doesn't work, therefore the battery can't be charged. I bought a new battery and tossed the old one thinking this was the problem. Seller then wouldn't take the product back. I bought a battery charger port so seller refunded the amount for the charger. Very displeased. Problem 3. Thus is an individual. It's far better dealing with people who have products vs one product.

If you want more protection you'll have to get a case that will probably be bulky and cover up your phone.

It offers a good balance of protection and size.  I have used this case on my 5s and my wife's 5c and it fits and works perfectly on both.I normally rest my pinky on the bottom of my phone while using it and this case does not bother me at all. Some cases like the elago s5 slim case is cut off at the bottom so it may irritate our finger there. This case does not do that at all.The only warnings I have are that there are two barley noticeable clear protectors for the clear backing that you have to peel off for it to look clear. You will feel like you are going to scratch the case up but if you are careful you can remove the film on the inside and outside of the case and it will look very nice.The included template to add your own photo  is also a nice touch.I would highly recommend this case to any iphone owner.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A8RUZEG" id="B00A8RUZEG-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-03:</strong> Compared to my other case, which is also a transparent case, I'd say this would be the bulkier version, depending on your situation you might like the bulkiness to be more carefree about dropping your phone, but I like a thin phone so id go with a slimmer transparent case then this case.

Case came with protecting plastic on both sides of case. Phone slides in okay. Fit is fairly tight which is good. Power and volume control buttons are covered by rubber buttons which I don't personally like.  The edges are not thin which is good and bad -- good protection including if you out your phone down face first (edges keep screen from touching table) but mute button is harder to access as we'll as plugging in earphones.  Good case which I'll probably use for a long while but 4 out of 5 because of covered buttons which don't feel as nice as phone's own buttons and edge color does not match phone exactly (not as shiny as pictured).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A8RUZEG" id="B00A8RUZEG-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-20:</strong> I ordered Navy Blue, but it's not the color as pictured on Amazon.

My only issue is that the case came with instructions to put a photo on the back but when you go to the website, you simply are unable to even create it...if it wasn't for that, I would have given it 5 stars.

The company who makes the case puts two plastic covers, one on the front & one on the back so the plastic doesnt get ugly or scratched during the shipping. I got my gold 5s yesterday & it just looks beautiful with the phone! The color of the case makes the gold on the back stand out, Its just great.

Another thing I noticed is that when I took this case off, there was a grid pattern on the sides of my Evo that I could not rub away.  The inside pattern of this case must have rubbed this pattern into the material.  The back of the phone has the same pattern on it, but I can replace the back cover.  The sides are another matter.  I ordered the Innocase Rugged product and am much more happy with that case.

I did manage to get the case dirty with maple syrup and saw dust. I removed it from the phone and washed it in dish water. Dried it with a soft towel and allowed it to sit in the drainer until all the little crevices were dry. Then I put it back on my phone. It came with a screen protector which I didn't realize and I didn't use since I already had a screen protector on it.

I have dropped my phone on asphalt with the case from waist height and no damage at all. It makes the phone around .71 inches thick but thats a small price to pay for good protection. The material is very high quality. It does become an issue trying to take my phone out of my jeans pocket and it does collect lint at first. The main issue I'm having is that it has stretched a little over time and the phone slides inside the case a little but not enough for it to come off at all.The case protects the camera lens and actually makes it easier to use the power and volume rocker buttons. The kickstand works just fine and access to the headphone jack, hdmi and power are good. Overall this case has amazing quality and is what to expect from Otterbox. In general any type of soft case will stretch a little and might collect lint. So if you don't mind that and the thickness of the case, the Otterbox Impact series case is a good protective case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0043GWDYI" id="B0043GWDYI-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-12-13:</strong> Been using this case since I received it.

And, the kickstand is a bear to get out (I have to use an ink pen or something similar to pop it out -- it's so difficult to do that you're liable to break a nail).  Having said all that, it's a solid, hard plastic case with a leather look. Somewhat slippery to hold though.  And, once you get the kickstand actually out, it's pretty cool.Update:  Now that I've had the case on my Droid X for a bit, here are a couple more observations:  It actually begins to have more of a slight "leather feel" the longer I've used it.  The kickstand is worthless when charging, as it is on the same side as the mini USB port, rendering it unusable for that purpose.  Looks good on the X, but beginning to wonder now how much I'll actually use the kickstand.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003WUX75A" id="B003WUX75A-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-08-27:</strong> The Amzer Limited Edition Elite Leather Snap On Hard Case is an exact clone of the case Verizon sells at its stores for $25. I've bought a couple of different style cases for my Droid X, and so far this one is the one I like most. It fits very well, even with the BH6X extended battery. It's not bulky, and weighs little. It's far from perfect though. The case is actually a plastic shell, with a thin leather skin glued onto it. I have my doubts that it will hold up for a long period of time. The kickstand while useful, is next to impossible to open without excessive force. It also rattles when closed, which annoys me. Phone protection is probably minimal too. For now it's my case of choice, but I'll keep looking for something better.Edit: I have to change my opinion on the protection the case provides. Yesterday, I accidentally dropped my phone on a concrete sidewalk. The phone hit on its top corner. Although there's a good sized gash in the case, the phone survived without a scratch. I'm pretty impressed now.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003WUX75A" id="B003WUX75A-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-08-21:</strong> This is a good protective case for the droid x.

However, with the cable attached it is useless.  The cover snapped on just fine but I'm not sure I can get it off without destroying it.  It locks together real tight.

I actually paid twenty dollars for this a few months ago. The texture is like hard leather- like a shoe- but textured. I have dropped my phone several times on concrete and no scratches on my phone. The case did snap off once, but only after being dropped. The only negative thing I can find about this is that it is difficult to remove if you need to pull the battery. However, that's my phone's fault. There should be no reason for me to pull the battery, but it freezes occasionally, and therefore need to pull the battery. I don't have a problem pulling out the kickstand. It is firm but I'm able to pop it out with fake nails as well as my soft real nails. The case looks nice, they kickstand is extremely useful when watching a youtube video or playing chess :)Update: After a couple of months and another few drops, one of the side tabs broke. It won't snap shut anymore. I went back to my old case that was a bejeweled case that attracted lint like crazy, and am now on the search for another. Yet here I am...eyeing this case again...the only one with a slim kickstand. The other commentor was right when he said the kickstand shouldve been on the other side; you can't charge the phone and use the kickstand simultaneously. Other than that, I'm thinking of buying it again. It protected my phone from several drops, and therefore worth it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003WUX75A" id="B003WUX75A-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-09-02:</strong> I received this item and snapped it around my Droid X and was instantly happy.

That being said, I will not type anymore words extolling its greatness as there are many positive reviews already written that cover anything I could say.I will take this time to write about two glaring omissions that would have made this the creme de la creme of Android phones.1 - The speaker phone is abysmalYou would think with phone this big they would have the space to put a good speaker or god forbid even stereo speakers in this bad boy, but no.  The speaker is barely audible in the car unless you place it right next to your ear, music playback is quite lame, podcasts are just tolerable.2 - No LED indicator lightWhy oh why can I not look across the room and see an indication of whether I have missed a call or received a text message, why in 2012 do they make a 700.00 phone without a simple LED alert light, this in my opinion is an inexcusable omission.So, other than those two issues it is a great phone.  I just wanted to warn potential buyers so they know up front about these issues.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0067WEX1M" id="B0067WEX1M-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-05:</strong> I don't usually write a review for a product..However, this item, Galaxy Note, is one of the best phone I ever used.I ordered the phone on 4/29 and received on 5/2...When I oped the item, it was brand new with samsung sealed tape..I used to have a iphone and since the contract ended, I wanted to try a Samsung Galaxy Note due to a huge screen size..Pro.1.

Also got a 50 dollar gift card for buying it from them so plus 2. Was tired of the small size of the Iphone and had one since release. It was time to move on to something better and was tired of waiting for the Iphone 5 that wont come until Fall now. All I can say is wow, and what other people say when they first see it. Already tell a huge difference in the vividness and clarity of the screen, the speed of AT&T's HSPA+ (almost 4G) here locally. The speed of the device hands down faster than the Iphone 4. Its icredibly thin and lite for its sheer size. Completely dwarfs my Iphone with screen size alone. Bought a gal case at the local AT&T store and paid way too much but needed protection other than from just insurance. Wasnt happy with the 40 dollar case so I ordered one from Amazon for 3 bucks and couldnt be happier, yeh 3 bucks look them up! The stylus is nice to have but havent used it much yet. I get about 13-15 hours on a charge with regular use, without wifi on, bluetooth or gps that is. Brightness all the way up. The videos look like 1080p like watching my 120hz led samsung tvs at home Im not kidding. Accepts MP4 format for videos. Watching movies on it I'm in awe. And 1080p you tube videos have to be seen to be believed. Email easy to set up once you get past Gmail account which you need to access the android market. Happy I got the white after years with a black iphone. I am able most of the time to use it one handed but not that easy takes practive I have normal male hands not huge. Overall so far the best phone Ive had. I had the Dell Streak when it released in 2010 but it was too glitchy and slow this blows that away.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0067WEX1M" id="B0067WEX1M-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-13:</strong> The screen is almost too big when you first put it in your hands and start playing with it but that goes away in the first week. Now I'm so used to big phones that I couldn't imagine going back to something under 5 inches! This comes with Gingerbread however which is known to be a battery hog. If you buy this I recommend rooting your phone and flashing Jellybean on to it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0067WEX1M" id="B0067WEX1M-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-03-22:</strong> REVISED/UPDATE--May 7, 2013: For over one year, I have owned this phone with no problems and it still looks and performs like new! AND GREAT NEWS: On May 6, 2013, I checked and Jelly Bean OTA (Over the Air directly on the phone) is HERE NOW! And today, I installed 4.1.2 Jelly Bean and LOVE IT on the GNote, feels like I just bought a new phone! Just for you to know: Samsung began rolling out OTA in late March 2013 for the Note N7000 so it takes a while for every country to receive this. So here is is all 511 GB of it! To get the update go to Settings, About Device and Software Update (you need to be in WiFi or Data and have 75% battery). The update is HUGE because it is Jelly Bean (no more Ice Cream Sandwich)! Now more about this great phone: I thought very long and hard before I bought this device in late February, 2012 and it came SEALED in the original box - totally new and unopened! This review is for the WHITE INTERNATIONAL UNLOCKED version of this device. I bought it from Amazon but chose to do the review under the dark blue device because it has more reviews and will be read more often.***Since over one year has past since I purchased the device (Feb 16, 2012), so I am more confident about this device as it works wonderfully in all areas! The reason I mention that is ALL INTERNATIONAL phones DO NOT have a US warranty and I took a HUGE chance spending $700 (at the time of purchase, it is now about $620) for this device! However, I have owed smartphones and computers for many years and have found that if they fail, 95% of the time they fail WITHIN THE FIRST 30 DAYS! In fact all of my smartphones have "shown" me in the first 30 days by "acting up" whether they would last or not. I have NEVER (so far) had any problems with this device. It is superb. Below are PROS and CONS.PROS:1) Huge 5.3" screen that is vivid, clear and easy to read. **The size is NOT TOO BIG for me and I am just 5'3" with small hands and the phone is light and easy to carry around. I also bought a combo pink case/cover for $10 on eBay that is slimline and protects the phone in style!2) Great music player with good sound with headset or speaker.3) FM radio included (AT&T; version does not have FM radio). So you DO NOT have to be on WiFi or Data to listen to the built in FM Radio App!4) Fast processor.5) Data has been 3g+ to 4g for data and it is lightening fast, fast, fast! (Mostly I use WiFi, but sometimes data and again, it is very fast). I have AT&T; data that I buy each month as I have the gophone (pre-paid plan) and I buy the smallest data they have as I use WiFi 95% of the time. However, I use my Tab2 7.0 3g for my data now as it has a larger screen.6) WiFi easy to connect and works perfectly with long range ability!7) Good stock browser, however, I downloaded Dolphin HD Browser and I can get "desktop" pages (not mobile pages) and also tabs, and so so many features. Opera is OK, but Dolphin HD blows all the other browsers away!8) Battery life - Decent - Since I am on WiFi or Data 100% of the time when I use this device so the battery lasts me about 5 hours before I have to recharge. Now when I turn the WiFi on and off to conserve battery, I get about 10 hours or more! Also I have backlight on 90%!9) I chose White color, very regal looking - so this is a pro for me!10) Size: Perfect combo mini tablet with 5.3" screen and great phone, don't need to lug around my 10" tablet anymore! And I do not think this device is too big to use as a phone and have no problem putting it up to me ear to make a call. This phone is lightweight and easy to hold. I bought a pink snap combo faux leather cover/case on eBay from US seller for just $10 and it is an all in one case and cover so this device is easy to carry and it is protected at all times.11) Camera and Video Camera - This takes better pictures than my regular camera and I move the pictures to my 32 gig SD card. And video is wonderful for a quick video! Mostly I take pictures when I am out and about, so no need to have to take my old camera as this device is: CAMERA, MINI TABLET, MUSIC PLAYER, FM RADIO ALL IN ONE DEVICE!!!!!CONS:1) This is an INTERNATIONAL PHONE WITH NO US WARRANTY. However, in the box there was a 24 month warranty with a Samsung UK address and phone number for the UK warranty center. This is the only concern I have. However, in my experience, most devices "act up" or "fail" within the first 30 days, (about 90% of the time), I am not worried, as I have had the phone well over 30 days and it is working perfectly and I am very pleased with my purchase of this device. So for this ONE reason, I deducted 1/2 of a star, hence 4.5 stars instead of the 5 stars that I would have given to this device.2) APN SETTINGS for Internet Data and MMS messages must be manually inputted (all international phones require this). WiFi and text messaging works right out of the box, however, APN settings are needed for Data and MMS messaging.If anyone needs the APN settings for AT&T; or T-Mobile, please comment and ask and I will answer and give you the APN settings. Also, I will answer any questions as I am a techie type of person. Thank you for reading my review.Please feel free to join our discussion should you have any questions or comments regarding the Galaxy Note. Since I am a techie person, I will be glad to answer questions.Thank you for reading this updated review and I hope that it has been of assistance to you.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0067WEX1M" id="B0067WEX1M-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-06-06:</strong> I got a Note in white. Took it to T-Mobile only to find out that the SIM card slot had a "leg" missing. Back it went.Reordered it, and now it freezes, to unfreeze it I take the battery out. it takes a long time time to "wake up", battery feels really warm, almost hot, have to wait for a long time for the system to finish scanning the media card, so if I am in a hurry to make a phone call, well, no luck there. I like the phone a lot, but it is more trouble than is worth (to me).

I probably use the stylus once every 2 weeks to write down a quick memo.I'm a girl so I generally keep my phone in my purse or bookbag.  Girl's jeans generally aren't big enough for my phone, and my few that are only about 1/2 to 2/3rds of the phone fit in the pocket.  It can fit into guys jeans and cargo pants really well with room to spare generally.  You can sorta tell that it is in there though.I don't consider the size a disadvantage, since I love how big the screen it.I got a case that covers the front and flips over to the back (like a book).  I really like it because I feel safe putting it in my purse or bookbag, without scratching it's beautiful screen.  Make sure not to get a case with a magnet on it.  In simple terms, the pen works though a magnet in the tip of the pen interacting with your screen, and I've heard stories of a magnet in the case messing with the phone and creating permanent dead spots that can't be written on anymore with the pen.Also, when looking for cases, if it is a case that replaces the back of your phone, make sure to check if it is for the N7000 and not the AT&T; one.  They don't have the same spots that snap together, and you will be very sad.If you have any questions, I'll try my best to answer. :)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0067WEX1M" id="B0067WEX1M-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-07-30:</strong> This is just the BEST wireless handset out there.The screen is big and gorgeous.

Poor battery life! I read the specs before purchasing and it says that it lasts much longer than the Samsung Infuse, my previous phone, but NOT even close! For example, I'd charge the battery on Samsung NOTE to full capacity until around noon or so and then by 6 or 7pm the battery indicator is already in the red! This is barely surfing or talking.  I never had a problem like this with my Infuse or my Samsung S2, my current phone.2. You can't create Ymail on the default android email account!! I didn't have this problem with Infuse or my current S2! I had to have 3 different email apps with the NOTE to see all my emails.  I have over 10 different email accounts such as Yahoo, Rocketmail, Ymail and Gmails.  So this is really inconvenient compared to my former phone Infuse!3. You can't turn off the loud clicking/shutter sound when taking pictures or Video recording! Again, there's no such problems with the Samsung Infuse or S2?? I like to have some privacy when taking pictures of the black board or the overhead screen projection during my class room lecture or meetings. This is really ridiculous!In summary, if you pay over $700 for a phone then it shouldn't have the problems I mentioned. Why is it that the less expensive phone can do more or give you more? It's illogical! I returned/sold the NOTE after having it for 5 days.  I hated the thought of paying so much for a phone and getting less than my previous Samsung Infuse which I sold for only $300. I now own Samsung S2 and love it! Also, I can create all email accounts onto just one app. (NOTE: Samsung S2 AT&T; version allows Ymail but not the Samsung S2 i9100 International version)  The only good thing about the NOTE is that the screen size is perfect for me. But otherwise, I wouldn't recommend the NOTE because of its price. It should be worth no more than $550 at this time for the flaws I mentioned.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0067WEX1M" id="B0067WEX1M-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-25:</strong> I love this phone.

What held me back? Really wanted an Android OS without the limits on it like the Kindle Fire. While the IOS5 is no doubt awesome, just didn't want to be limited by Steve Jobs' view of the world. (Flash, please.) But I was initially beaten down by the way-too-many Android phone options, with their respective pros & cons. IPhone 4s was just an easy way out. UNTIL....I saw the white Samsung Galaxy Note. No more need for a heavy tablet to drag around on the road with me. Can still use the Straight Talk Unlimited Plan, courtesy of the sim card from my Nokia e71. Gorilla glass, so no PITA screen saver needed. Blazing fast data connections (thanks to another customer's inclusion of the best APN settings for the Note in his Amazon review). A screen more brilliant than any device I have ever owned. The most perfect size...it fits comfortably in my hand even with a leather case on it.[Zenus] Masstige Ostrich Diary Case Cover for Galaxy Note (I9220/N7000) - Royal NavyLightweight. The Android Gingerbread OS is awesome & can't wait for the ICS update. And did I mention the SIZE? The iPhone 4s I almost bought fits completely inside the glass screen of the Note. I would have been miserable trying to read that 3.5" screen and constantly zooming in & out. No zooming needed with my Note.About the Amazon sale: next day delivery with Prime. Fulfilled by Amazon but the seller changed between the time I placed the order and when it was shipped. But the phone arrived in a sealed original box with everything intact. Had to change the language from Spanish to English since it's an unlocked international version. No warranty but I am OK with that. If anything goes wrong, it happens in the first 30 days usually with tech items.Negatives: none. You have to figure out settings etc when dealing with an unlocked phone but Google is your friend. The battery does not last a full day for me but I am figuring out how to find and turn off auto updates etc that suck battery power. But I do plan to buy an extra batteryHyperion Samsung Galaxy Note 2 x Battery + Charger (Compatible with At&t; Samsung Galaxy Note, and all international Galaxy Note models)and keep it handy. The tech experts on You Tube claim they have no problem with battery life but they are smarter than I am in figuring out how to reduce battery drain thru apps & widgets.Android OS: I hate the live wallpaper and can't figure out how to get rid of the stock wallpaper screens I do not want. Google has not been my friend. I've read that the international Notes will receive the ICS update before the AT&T; Notes. Gingerbread runs like silk for now.I am so glad something stopped me from sealing the deal on an iPhone 4S. The Note exceeds all my expectations in features I anticipated and those I didn't even know existed.Get the white if like me you just don't "see" black gadgets anymore, like in the handbag or on the desk, and have to call your black phone to find it.

She is always losing her charging cord.  Anyway, they arrived much quicker than I expected, I can't remember how long, probably 10 days or so and I was expecting a month.They all work but the tips are all a little too big.  I have to force them into the phones and to the adapters.  Two of the mini USB tips nearly came off inside the phone.  I've had to superglue them back on to the cord.  But for the price I don't mind.  Now our house has cords all over the place and we never have to look for one.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00490Z2J6" id="B00490Z2J6-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-14:</strong> Excelente producto, muy recomendable, muy buena calidad, lo utilizo para llevar en el carro y con todo el uso que se le ha dado no ha fallado.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00490Z2J6" id="B00490Z2J6-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-16:</strong> this item, although it's inexpensive is too cheap to bother with.

But it's so inexpensive it's not too much to lose.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00490Z2J6" id="B00490Z2J6-review66" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-27:</strong> It does what it supposed to doWorks with Jabra Cruiser blue tooth devicecould have been little longer, but its fine</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00490Z2J6" id="B00490Z2J6-review67" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-25:</strong> Its cheap and probably cheaply made but thats what I bought it for. i wouldn't expect it to be great and I definitely wouldn't use it for any sort of ROMing or anything that requires a GOOD cable.

I use these things all the time for charging my smartphone, e-reader, tablet, and external battery packs. So far I haven't found a device that doesn't work with this cable, and it also works fine for transferring data. I've used it on both 1A and 2A outlets and it seems to work just like any other cable.The neat thing about this one is it retracts. At full length it's a bit less than a yard long, which is plenty for me. A standard cable of this length is a pain to manage- gets tangled and stuck way too easily. These ones wind up when not in use and are adjustable to any length between, making them a lot easier to handle. When retracted they easily fit in a pocket.Perhaps best of all, the things are dirt cheap- these are cheaper than most non-retracting USB-micro cables I've seen. I've been a bit rough with the mechanism on occasion and they seem reasonably durable as well. They're my cable of choice for travel use.So far I've used it with the following devices, with no issues:Kindle PaperwhiteKindle Fire HD 7&#34;Samsung Galaxy S3HTC EVO 3DAssorted external battery packs (Pyle, Anker, Gorilla)I've used these to charge from outlets, 12V car cig lighter adapters, and external battery packs. Works fine.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00490Z2J6', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00490Z2J6', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B0093CDKCQ</h2>    <p class="price"> $B0093CDKCQ</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0093CDKCQ" id="B0093CDKCQ-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-29:</strong> nice and snugholds your iphone very good, nice back stand as well it work for my son when hes watching somethingfasshipping, i got it before the expected timeNICE AND CLEAN PACKEGING,</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0093CDKCQ" id="B0093CDKCQ-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-10:</strong> I've had this for awhile and it's durable and holds up well.

You have to pry very hard to get it off and in the process, you will damage some of the rhinestones on the lid of the case. One other thing you can not charge phone with case on. Once you plug the charger in, it does not plug in tightly, the case hinders it from it plugging in tightly. We almost had to almost tear the top of the case off, to get it off and it will bend easily when trying to remove it. The Pen works great.

But we ended up tossing them away because they were incompatible with our choice of screen protector. The case kept lifting the edge of the protector. Part of the problem may be due to our choice of screen protector. But part is due to the fact that these cases are so soft that they move around a bit as you hold them and squeeze the sides to have a good grip on the phone. That movement is what was causing the case to lift the edge of our screen protector.We use ArmorSuit screen protectors. They really fit the Samsung Galaxy S3 perfectly, even though the screen has tapered edges. But the ArmorSuit material is soft and can be lifted if a case wraps around the front and is in contact with the protector as it is in our case.We have three S3 phones and all of us experienced the same problem using these cases. Luckily we were able to re-stick the edges of the protector that these cases tried to pull up.We have all moved on to other cases that don't wrap around the front of the screen. In our case none of us have a history of dropping our phones so we don't need cases for damage. We just want a case that provides a better grip as the S3 is slippery.I'll give the case 3 stars because they aren't bad. But I'll take off stars because they don't work with all screen protectors as they wrap around the top edge and contact the screen protector and they move which can interfere with the screen protector. Pretty cheap though. We wish they would have worked for us.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008CNZ8KY" id="B008CNZ8KY-review25" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-15:</strong> I was excited to get these so I could change my case at any given time.

Believe me, its worth it :) For $16, this is an GREAT buy!!!!! Well, as it says, you get 10 cases, all of which are very more vibrant in person, a cleaning cloth, and a screen protector which all work very well. BUT- the only thing though about the cases (that i previously read also) is that yes, you have to take off the case slightly to charge the phone... because the charger plug does stay in but then sooner or later, it slips out/ off. Other than that though, all of the other slots/ buttons are very crisp and alert. Like, for example(s), on top you have your headphone jack port slot which is very roomy/ big because you don't have to worry about any problems of plugging in/ out the headphones. On the back, the camera, speaker, and flash ports/ spots are very clear and the case isn't in the way of the view. Also, the volume and the power buttons on the sides are very crisp and clear- you can hear the volume button whenever you press them with the case on them. For personal use, I picked the dark blue case and this is what i experienced, none of which of with the other cases and so i hope to get a chance to try on all the cases on to see if i get all of the same experiences even though they are from the same brand :)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008CNZ8KY" id="B008CNZ8KY-review45" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-07:</strong> These are some cool lil cases to just slap on.

I got 10 nice quality cases in a great pallet of colors for $15 which even qualified for "Prime" shipping. This order was great as 5 members of my family have the Samsung Galaxy S3. My wife and I and mother-in-law just started a new cell phone plan and got these cases within the week. We chose our colors (orange and purple), my son (black) mother in law (blue) and daughter in law (pink). As a backup, I also chose the bright green and my wife chose the deep red.The case is very good quality. It is NOT flimsy, soft silicone. It fits very snug and stays on. Some have said it's too tight but that's subjective, I had no problem getting it on. It's a blend of about 75% 'hard' plastic and 25% soft silicone thrown in. The slight soft texture gives it just enough grip/traction so it doesn't slip off slightly angled surfaces like car dashboards. ALL the holes (in the cases I've taken) line up perfectly. There was a tiny bit of over-mold flashing in the two smallest holes (which doesn't hamper anything) but it's nothing a sharp scalpel (if you have one) didn't take care of.With the Galaxy S3 being so popular and on sale at a lot of places (due to the release of the S4), getting 10 cases is nice for families. I'll bet you' may even have a friend who could use a new case.Thank you "The Friendly Swede" and Amazon!!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008CNZ8KY" id="B008CNZ8KY-review60" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-09-12:</strong> These fit perfectly, look and feel nice, and are of sturdy construction, but the hole where the charger plugs in isn't quite big enough for the OEM S3 charger.  You have to pop the bottom half of the cover off to get the charger to go all the way in.There is also a bit of flashing around the edge that can confuse you when you are feeling for button locations.  I trimmed it off with an exacto.I also have the flip cover, and these actually fit onto the device with the flip cover.  The caveat is that you can't really feel the volume rocker when you have the flip cover open, but since they weren't made for this, I can't exactly dock points.  I am considering attempting to modify one of the pink ones (not a big fan of pink) to see if I can solve this, and if it works, I may modify the rest too.  Perhaps someone can come up with a silicone cover designed to work with the flip cover.The colors are striking against the white galaxy S3.If they would fix the charger issue, this would be a great buy, and would get a five star rating.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008CNZ8KY" id="B008CNZ8KY-review61" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-16:</strong> This is a nice selection of soft covers for the price.

I needed to port my phone number from my VoIP provider to Google Voice, but Google Voice can only port in mobile phone numbers.  So I ported my number for free from my VoIP provider to this phone, and then to Google Voice for a twenty dollar fee.  I barely used this phone, but for the extremely low price it seemed like a decent phone if you need to keep things simple and inexpensive.  The buttons were nice and large and the screen was fairly easy to read.  The menu navigation was a little weird until you got the hang of it.  It is so amazing how low the price is for this phone, especially since there is no contract.

But I didn't feel like getting another android phone or apple, especially with news of the upcoming Nexus and iPhone 6 later this year. So I decided to tough it out and get a basic flip phone. Just 8 years ago touch screen smart phones were barely coming in and people were crazy about getting latest and greatest bar, flip or slider :) I want to gain an appreciation of wireless phone technology by removing the clutter of apps, finicky OS's, short battery life, featureless slabs of gorilla glass and sky high prices.I chose this phone for its utter simplicity and long battery life. It's running smoothly for me no hiccups at all. With my SGSII I had gotten into the habit of charging it every night. But with this phone Alcatel 665 I haven't had to charge for three days before one of the bars disappeared. Reception with tmobile in my area was better than the galaxy and at times was more accurate at reading service availability.Operating the phone Is pretty basic and you'd be able to figure stuff out pretty easily. Just make sure you go through all the submenus, cuz they hold extra tidbits of information -sometimes important ones. Comes with one battery, micro USB charger, instructions and a SIM card. If you're gonna be handing this off to elderly folks you might want to configure some of the more complex stuff yourself first, like: sim card or handset lock so you have a copy of the codes, style of ringing, alarms, profiles, etc.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007ZSWEKO" id="B007ZSWEKO-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-25:</strong> The phone is not worth the money.

Since I spent so much money on this phone I didn't want to go with a slim TPU case because they don't offer adequate drop protection but I didn't want an otterbox case either because those things are too big. This case was just in the medium and it fit just right. It offers medium protection without the bulk, it's easy to slip in and out of pockets. The majority of the back is glossy so the grip is solid unlike matte covers. The only con is the crappy screen protector it comes with and the back glossy part is prone to scratches as well as the front lip isn't really that thick.

The case offers complete protection for all sides of the phone. The case even comes with a screen protector, although I have elected not to use it. I'd highly recommend this case.I also purchased two holsters with this case. Both holsters are beautifully made, are very inexpensive, and fit this case nicely (although they're a bit tight upon first use). I highly recommend the following holsters:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008DJ3142/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00 Samsung Galaxy S3 Bergamo Italian Leather Case Holster with Swivel & Fixed Belt Clip (for dress)http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008FQR63U/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00 Heavy Duty Vertical Nylon Pouch Belt Clip Holster Carrying Case For Samsung Galaxy S3 i9300, i747 (for work)The above combinations are far superior (in my opinion) to the Otterbox Defender that costs nearly twice as much.

I generally have the Rock Quicksand case (excellent case by the way) on my S3 most of the time, but will switch over to the Faxion when I know I'll need a little more drop protection.Doesn't add very much bulk at all, but definitely provides some decent drop protection. I always put it on when I know my kids are going to be playing with my phone. Case has nice styling, but I suppose that's going to vary for everyone. The white and grey looks great on my white S3 and doesn't look out of place in an office environment. Adds a little bit of weight but it feels very good in the hand.Looked at the Incipio Silicrylic also but didn't want the 2 piece case and wasn't a fan of silicone. Also looked into the Speck Candyshell, but read a few reviews about the charger port area cracking. Also saw that the Faxion was slightly thinner than the Candyshell and I was looking for a secondary protective case that added the least amount of bulk. So far, very happy with this one. The back gets a little scratched up, but with the white, it's not very noticeable.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008B81ZDE" id="B008B81ZDE-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-10:</strong> This case is VERY hard. It actually makes pressing the power and volume keys very hard sometimes. Maybe some cases might be softer and thus easier to press, but mine can be kinda hard sometimes. The other issue I have with the case is that sometimes, upon taking it out and putting it back on, it does not go into place properly, and blocks off a portion of the area needed to plug the charger in properly. It's usually too far over on the right side of the phone.But I am pleased with the quality and style of the case, and despite my complaints above, I will continue to use it until I decide I need a refresh.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008B81ZDE" id="B008B81ZDE-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-06:</strong> This case seems like it would provide decent protection, but it doesn't have a lot of texture.

In the mail I have the 40" antenna "CA40M" just to see what a ridiculously-long antenna can do.I installed the antenna on my trunk and I see an increase in dBm (signal strength) as well as download speeds (24Mbps -> 31Mbps).  I haven't had a chance to test it's "max-range" in the middle of the desert yet, but what I see from in-my-garage testing shows promise.The product also fits my S4 well.

For that this case works very well.As most of the other reviews have pointed out this front flap does not line up properly and 3 to 4 mm of the screen are exposed at one side. In practice this does not really lessen the protection you get from the case it just looks bad.On my case not only is the cover off to the side a bit but also a bit sideways when you twist it a bit to get the clip to wrap around the other side.The build quality of the case leaves a bit to be desired. There are a few paces where the stitching is messed up a bit. It looks bad but the case is not falling apart yet.The other major issue is that the case opens backwards! Not only does this feel weird when trying to use the phone it also makes most of your apps upside down when you try to use the case in stand mode.Huge oversight in my book.But the case does what I purchased it for.
