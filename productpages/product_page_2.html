You plug it in as directed on the instructions.  To use it you lift the handset and push a button on the earpiece to turn the earpiece on.  The sound quality is very good.  Microphone seems good, nobody has complained they cannot hear me.  Volume is adjustable.  There is really no detectable interference.  There is no head attachment so you must use this over the ear.  That would have been nice.  Sometimes in a hurry it is tricky to get it situated on your ear correctly.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B000P7LHDW" id="B000P7LHDW-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-18:</strong> the batter died and then yo uahve to buy and solder a new one in there.  REALLY!  or thow it out and buy a new one for 200.they say they dont make the CS70N anylonger so you have to buy a whole new unit.  Terrible design.im on the phone a good part of the day and should have known better to not buy a more expensive unit.do yourself a favor and call the manufacturer first and ask about stuff like battery life, how to replace.  I would have not purchased this if I had know it woudl last only a year or two.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B000P7LHDW" id="B000P7LHDW-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-06:</strong> The range is really great and the battery life has been very good so far. It does the most important things well. Here's why I'm giving just 4 stars: 1) It picks up too much background noise. I was able to improve that someone with setting changes, but it still picks up significantly more than just the handset. 2) It suffers from interference with other bluetooth devices. If my cell phone and regular bluetooth are in proximity of me while I'm using this my voice will start cutting out. I have to move my cell phone and bluetooth to the side of my desk so it's not between me with this headset and the base. It's an easy fix, but caused a major issues for a while until I figured that out.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B000P7LHDW" id="B000P7LHDW-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-08:</strong> I just upgraded to this unit at work.  I am on conference calls for up to 6 hours a day and I need a headset to free my hands for typing and my neck from having to go to the chiropractor.  I previously used a blu-tooth model that did not have good sound.  People were always asking me to speak up.  Then if I turned it up a notch, it shrieked.This new DECT 6.0 gives wonderful sound quality.  It is as good or better than the quality from the handset.  The wireless capability makes this even more convenient.My only complaint is that this unit is a bit bigger on the part that goes behind the ear than other units I have owned.  It makes for a difficult fit.  I never have a feeling of being able to ignore that it is there.Pros:o sound qualityo wireless capacity / distanceo easy to find accessories - this is a well known brandCons:o how it fits on the earOverall - I recommend this unit for the sound quality, which is the best of any unit I have owned.  If the fit were a bit better, it would get the full 5 stars.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B000P7LHDW" id="B000P7LHDW-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-03-25:</strong> Just received it this morning and feel strongly that I should write something about it. This is a really nice wireless headset. Setup in 5 minutes. Spend a little more time on 6 different ear pieces comes with it and decided on one with silicon gel that fits really good. The sound quality is decent and is comfortable to wear. It is also lightweight and I can barely felt it. Replacing the ear piece caused me to break one small cushion piece around the connector, but it can be avoided. Don't think it is a quality issue. The headset can be used for either right or left ear. Overall I am very happy about the purchase.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B000P7LHDW" id="B000P7LHDW-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-04-13:</strong> Over the years I have tried so many different brands of headsets and none of them worked like a Plantronics.

Once on, it's absolutely adorable and the buttons all align up pretty well. BUT it offers no front screen protection, as in the case doesn't cover the phone around the sides. Though that's no big deal if you have a screen protector. Biggest thing for the 2-star review though is that since it's a case that snaps on so flimsily, I'm willing to bet that if I dropped this phone at any time the case wouldn't offer any protection at all.So, cute but you definitely get your money's worth.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FC0JRC" id="B005FC0JRC-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-12:</strong> Works great, looks even better on the while i phone. very soft and easy to hold, does not slip out of your hands</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FC0JRC" id="B005FC0JRC-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-11:</strong> For the price this cover is very nice.

When I saw this case, I had to order it, it is so girly. I did read some of the other reviews and am so happy that my case arrived in perfect condition. It fits my iPhone perfectly, and looks so nice. I am sure to receive many compliments on  this case as I have not seen any iPhones with a like case. I immediately took my green and white bumper off my iPhone and replaced it with this one. Thank you so much for a lovely case. Will reccomend this case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FC0JRC" id="B005FC0JRC-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-05:</strong> The only weakness to this case is that it covers the volume buttons completely.

Many water proof containers have a flap that folds over and this one does not.  The thumb wheel type openers are difficult to operate but I suppose that's a good thing that they aren't easily opened in the water.  I tested by putting the screen cleaner cloth that comes with it inside the pouch and drowning it for several hours in the pool.  It is difficult to sink if it has air inside so squeeze out any excess air to test.  It passed the test and the cloth was dry after several hours in the pool.  I had to put it in a bucket full of water and then tipped it upside down and sunk it to the bottom.  The stylus that comes with it looks remarkably like the one I paid $20 for at Best Buy!  The strap is also nicely made.  I suggest blowing a little air in with your phone when you close it... to help keep your phone afloat and easily found should it come loose from where you have it attached.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AK1GN4Q" id="B00AK1GN4Q-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-08:</strong> Look great and worked great.

I figured if it leaked or sank to the bottom of the sea, I'd still have my phone. The strap came in handy a few times. I do have plans to buy a floating strap, though. Both my iPod and iPhone have Otter Boxes on them and they each fit inside the case nicely. I took the iPod and case snorkeling in Nassau last week and it worked out great. I snorkeled for about an hour and a half, including diving down about 6 feet, and had no leakage. I did forget to squeeze all the air out, so for some of the above water photos there was some glare from the plastic, but that was operator error.

We used it on the beach to keep the phone from getting sand or receiving too much sunlight. It also protects it from falls and hits... it's like the ultimate &#34;phone cover&#34; you can hang from your neck. The pen works perfectly.About the water proof thing... I really have my doubts, you have to close it VERY TIGHLY so you can put it underwater, and anyways you get to see little bubbles coming out (and that's when you start to freak out). Phone doesn't get wet, but definitely gets very very humid, so BE CAREFULL, use with extreme caution and try to close it even better with your own hands while underwater.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AK1GN4Q" id="B00AK1GN4Q-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-14:</strong> This is an excellent waterproof case, it works exactly as described.

Their phones are some other brand, but they still fit nicely.  I was worried once i got it that it wouldn't because their phone isn't listed as one that this case Is for, but they do fit. None of us are brave enough to actually intentionally put our phones in water,  but we will keep phones in these while at the lake this summer.

I wanted to be able to take pictures in the lagoon without damaging or ruining my cell phone since that was the smallest and most compact item to take pictures with without lugging around big expensive equipment. I must say I was hesitant at first, but I did a trial run at home first with paper towels inside the case submerged under water overnight. It seemed to work fine without any leakage. The same held true while at the lagoon. At times it was hard getting my cell to take a picture when I pushed the snap button, but overall it took a pic when I pressed snap. Also, picture quality wasn't 100% crisp, but I wasn't looking for perfection nor professional grade shots. I just wanted to be able to get some shots so that I could show friends and family what it was like in the lagoon. I couldn't have asked for a better product. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to take shots in the water without having to worry. And yes, my cell was submerged under the water for great lengths while enjoying my time in the lagoon. If I can find a way to post pics from my cell using this waterproof case, I will post them.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AK1GN4Q" id="B00AK1GN4Q-review23" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-20:</strong> I bought this so I could but my Galaxy S3 phone to secure it at the water-park.

Due to the condensation, I did have to wipe the lens now and then so it could shoot clear. Must have for water-parks!! I was also able to but my drivers license,debit card, and two season passes in the pouch as well! You can still use your fingers to navigate your phone touch screen though it can be tricky at times.

If you're worried about small drops getting on your phone, or if you're using this to keep documents dry, it's best to let the exterior of the case dry before removing your items because they will get slightly wet on the way out.Pros:- Seals well- Fits my LG G2 with slim case on- Touch screen works- Camera quality almost as good as without- Plastic feels solidCons- The clips are just a little too hard to open when you want to get your goods out. Finger nails may be chipped- If your phone has a light sensor that turns the screen off depending on the light (as mine does), then you have to make sure your light sensor won't be coveredOverall I'm happy with the product.

Inside was the waterproof pouch, lanyard, cleaning cloth, and stylus.  I wanted the lanyard so I could attach the pouch to me while in the water while snorkeling or boating so I wouldn't lose my phone.I always look for good deals when buying stuff like this and this pouch is the best deal out there right now, Sept 2013.  It was $13 when I bought the white version, now all versions are $14.49.The first thing I did was to put in some kleenex and submerge it.  I even compressed it so bubbles would show if there was a leak.  No leaks, just like all these reviews say, but if it's my $650 Samsung Galaxy S4 phone, I'll test it myself too.  The lanyard attaches to a eyelet on the top of the pouch very well.  So losing my phone should not be a problem.I'm a photographer by trade so I want to know if I can use the S4 for shots underwater.  The S4 without the case is fine in good light.  The case adds some softness to the images.  It's not terrible, but you can see there is less sharpness.  But it's still takes a pretty good image.  Underwater, you wouldn't get any shot without the case so it's good there.  I have the regular S4, not the "active" S4.I put my S4 in the pouch and tried to take pictures in a bowl of water.  Sometimes the camera accepted the touch screen command and took the picture and sometimes it did not.  Out of the water it works perfectly.  I tried setting the screen to "High touch sensitivity" and that helped underwater a little, but not enough.  So I made the volume buttons the camera shutter.  To do this I changed the camera settings to use "The camera key" in the "Volume key" setting.  You get there by being in camera and pressing settings, then the 3rd tab shows this setting.  It took a little to get used to the volume key as the shutter, especially in the pouch, but it is serviceable.  I almost gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  But it's not the pouch's fault, the camera/phone touch screen just doesn't work well underwater.  I never expected that, but after "further review" I should have.  Also after further review, everyone should set the volume buttons as the shutter.  It's easier to take a picture without shaking the camera.The pouch locking mechanism is quick to close up, but opening it can be a pain.  I'm a guy and my fingernails are not that strong, but with some effort, I can open up the pouch without a screwdriver.  Since I can use the S4 functions without taking it out of the pouch, it's ok.You can choose how buoyant it is by having extra air or not in the pouch.  If you put in too much air, the phone can be hard to operate.Whenever I use underwater gear I always include a/some silica bag/s.  This pouch is no exception.  I put a silica bag in the pouch to stop the condensation that might happen.  These are those little white bags of stuff you get in all kinds of packaging that needs to stay dry during shipment.When taking video, the same sharpness complaint is there of course, but the plastic stops wind noise, but not other sound so that's good.I'm very happy with this pouch, now I can take and use my S4 in sand and water.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AK1GN4Q" id="B00AK1GN4Q-review28" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-29:</strong> I needed something to keep my new LG Optimus F3 (Virgin Mobile) from getting messed up. My first thought was to find your basic otter case.  That kind of case worked for my old LG Optimus Elite but the screen suffered since I carried that old phone in my pocket (mini scratches, etc).  I digress.  I did end up buying a sleek mini otter case for my phone and found out that my phone doesn't fit cases that I've come across so far.  I like the otter (silicone/plastic) back because without it, the phone will continue to slip through my fingers, a lot!Then the ECO-FUSED Waterproof Case caught my eye during my latest search online.  I don't swim, dive or come close to bodies of water, but I do leave my phone by a work sink, so it makes sense.  I've used it for about 2 weeks with no damage to my phone, mission accomplished!  It's great because I can just put it in my purse (no problem), by the sink (perfect!) and in the car (a phone saver).  Plus, my phone WITH mini otter fits well inside and it looks like it was made for it.My peeps have commented: &#34;is that a phone charger?&#34;, &#34;what a cool phone protector&#34;, &#34;where did you get that? I love it&#34;.  One of those who commented dropped her iPhone a couple of months ago. The screen on her phone looks like a spider web and the phone company won't help her get a new one until her contract renews.  One of the big three, shame on them!  This case would have prevented that.By the way, the only thing I have trouble doing to my phone when it's in the ECO-FUSED waterproof case is to try to press the power button on the upper right side of the phone.  Don't really care though because I set up my phone to turn on if I hit the front action/home button and off after two minutes. P.S. that phone I have has yet to run out of juice after 3 days.  Best phone ever for me.  How this relates to this case?  Having it in this case prevents accidental ON and subsequent power drain to the phone, at least so far.  My old phone always heated up because of that kind of thing.AAAA+++++ ECO-FUSED!  A case not only for underwater use.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AK1GN4Q" id="B00AK1GN4Q-review29" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-01:</strong> After my boating accident by which my Galaxy S3 got total (salt) water damage (the water damage indicator got bright red on both the phone and battery), I replaced it with S4.  I thought about buying insurance (T-mobile told me that it is about $11 per month for my $30 a month prepaid plan aka Walmart plan, plus about $150 deductible).  So, I looked around waterproof skin/cover and this product is the only one that lists S4 as a compatible model.  Upon receiving it, I tried this cover.  It worked!  Camera also works in the case.  It came with a pen which works from outside the cover.  For my next boating trip, I will make sure that my phone is in this.  For the amount of money involved, this probably saved a few hundred $$ than buying an insurance (I am very careful with the handset.  I have never dropped but my phone is in a plastic case so the only way I would damage my phone would be by water).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AK1GN4Q" id="B00AK1GN4Q-review30" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-26:</strong> This product went beyond expectation.

However, I decided to test it by submerging it under water with the cardoard insert it came with and the top corners were a bit wet after a while.

It is the best one so far but still not perfect.Things I like about it:* good sound quality. I've used it when driving and could hear very well. There were no complaints on the other side too so I assume they could hear me well.* comfortable. I use it with the ear piece and it fits well. You can keep it on while driving and it doesn't bother (almost...). I don't know if it's my ears that are different from all the rest of the world but the 'in ear' innovative ways to mount headsets just never work for me... I must have an ear piece that goes around the ear.* affordable. I got this for the incredibly low price of around $15. I am not comfortable with spending $100 or even $50 for a BT headset no matter how nice its features are. The only thing I would pay more for is for excellent sound quality that can handle background noises and winds. I still haven't heard of a headset that does this perfectly so until there is one, I'll just look for ones that don't cost too much.* easy pairing* can be charged via USB so no need for a power socket (but can still be charged using a socket)* dedicated power button* battery and connection indicatorsthings that I think need to improve* power button is very awkward placed.* power/battery/connection indicators only light when the power button is pressed* this is the most annoying thing: you need to press the power button for a few seconds to turn on/off. A sliding power switch with an on/off position would be best: it will be easy to use and will immediately indicate if the device is on or off. I think Jabra are using this for newer modelsIt's worth noting that integration with iPhone is different from my old headset. for example, i don't know how to direct music to the headset (but maybe you're not supposed to do this. I mean why would you listen to music on a one ear headset...). However, with this headset the phone still rings and most sounds are not directed to the headset until you actually start or answer a call, which i find very useful. with my old BT, all sounds were re-directed to the BT so you couldn't hear 'click' sounds when dialing or even message tones etc.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B002DJEQ6K" id="B002DJEQ6K-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-28:</strong> Large ear piece did not fit in my ear.

I'm moving backward to fountain pens, stationery, and great stamps with music in the background.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B002DJEQ6K', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B002DJEQ6K', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B009PAWIZ6</h2>    <p class="price"> $B009PAWIZ6</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009PAWIZ6" id="B009PAWIZ6-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-22:</strong> muy bueno , calza muy bien en el telefonome hubiera gustado que fuera mas gomosohay que quitarlo para usar el adaptador de HDMI.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009PAWIZ6" id="B009PAWIZ6-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-22:</strong> A strong and solid case.

Most recently on the Note 2 it has become a little more challenging because I wanted a case that would protect my phone but not add so much bulk that the already huge Note 2 got bigger.  This is the perfect case if you are in that category.  The case fits nice and snug, there is no extra room for the case to move around and it covers all around the phone so that you can put your phone screen down without anything hitting the screen.  The design on the back and sides give you that extra grip and overall is a solid design.  The glossy parts of the case do attract finger prints and smudges but they wipe off easily enough.  All the cut out of the phone are easily accessible and the case's covers for the volume rocker and power button do not restrict use at all.For the price of this case you can't ask for a better deal!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009PAWIZ6" id="B009PAWIZ6-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-30:</strong> This case for the Note 2 has to be the best value in an phone case on AMazon.

Considering I am prone to dropping my phone I knew I needed to get something on there right away.  I bought this hoping it was a hard plastic phone but it is more of a soft plastic.  Not like a gel case mind you but a flexible plastic.  Not entirely sure this will protect the phone from a large fall and I hope not to find out, but it should do for protection for now.  Feels good in the hand, very cheap price and I got it in four days.  I say get it until something better comes out.

The GN2 is a large phone, and I wanted something that would keep the back from scratching, provide a better grip on the device, and some shock protection in case of an accidental drop.  This case performs well for all of those needs.  The only gripe I can think of is that the shiny "X" in the middle is a fingerprint magnet, but it quickly cleans up with a microfiber cloth.  The cover is easy to remove and replace, yet stays on securely.  I'll be using this cover when I have the device in the car cradle (flip cover won't work), and my flip cover for most other situations and "formal occasions".  Can't go wrong with the low price on this product.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009PAWIZ6" id="B009PAWIZ6-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-16:</strong> The price is right, it adds grip to the phone without adding much size, and it looks good.

Another disappointed Amazon reviewer of the case mentioned above informed the DURA X as a good alternative in their review, so I gave the DURA X case a try. This is a very nice, attractive case that should protect the Note 2 well.  The only complaint I have is I wish it had that rubber matte soft feel.  This case has a much harder feel, and doesn't have the same easy grip that you get from the rubber matte finish style cases.  However at the end of the day I want a case that protects the $700 phone it houses, that is, and always will be priority one for the case in my book.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009PAWIZ6" id="B009PAWIZ6-review21" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-19:</strong> This is my everyday case.

I prefer this over the one with kick stand because it seems to offer more protection for the screen.  IMO, the lip that goes around the screen is substantially thick enough to feel that the screen will be well protected if dropped face down on even flat surface but definitely not on an uneven pavement.  It is well design not bulky like some others.  The material is thick enough to have a feeling that the phone will be well protected and can absorb the shock all around if dropped (no, I haven't been brave enough to perform the dropped test).The only draw back is the fitting is bit too loose in my taste.  Overall, I am very please with this exceptional case especially for the price and its quality.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B009PAWIZ6', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B009PAWIZ6', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00C9QE3AQ</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00C9QE3AQ</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C9QE3AQ" id="B00C9QE3AQ-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-15:</strong> Does what it say it will though it slips out a bit here and there, overall I think it was a good deal</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C9QE3AQ" id="B00C9QE3AQ-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-08:</strong> Bought this for me but sadly it won't work with the Kraken AMS case due to the large amount of bulk added By the case depth wise.

First I use it more than I thought I would. It is simply handy for me to put the phone in the cradle each time I get in the car so I am not fumbling around with the phone.I haven't had any of the problems so of the other reviewers mentioned. The cradle comes with several sets of  sticky 'pads', I added one set to the cradle to make it the proper width for my CD player slot. The cradle has never came out of the slot nor has my phone fallen out of the mount. The phone stays wherever I put it and I have driven more than 1,500 miles.I will make a note that I have a Samsung Galaxy Note (large phone) so I have only put the phone into the cradle in the lengthwise position- I don't think it would fit crosswise. I am able to rotate the screen into the crosswise or lengthwise position and it holds either way.I would recommend this. I drive a Prius and my radio controls are not below the CD player. This would not work well in a Nissan Rogue since there is a large knob behind where the phone hangs.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C9QE3AQ" id="B00C9QE3AQ-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-24:</strong> really good product, it stick like glu in my car. i did i coast to coast trip and i didn`t move at all.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C9QE3AQ" id="B00C9QE3AQ-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-03:</strong> Great, I really like it.

First off, my phone is a Samsung Galaxy Note 3, which is a very large phone.  Due to it's size and the positioning blocking some buttons on my radio, I tried to install the holder upside-down, like several reviewers said worked for them.  It popped out of the CD tray several times, crashing to the floor with my phone in it.  I tried a thicker insert, and it very tight, but the problem kept happening, so I just inserted it correctly.  Now it stays pretty well...except the arms do not hold the phone for long.  After a few bumps and turns, my phone pops out and falls.  Out of six trips, I've managed two trips without my phone falling to the floor, and that's with constant checking and pushing the edges back in.It should be noted that I'm using a very low profile case also (CaseMate Pop), which, of the three cases I have, is the thinnest.  So, I'll probably give this to my husband to use with his iPhone 5S, which it will be great for.  I think my phone is just too large and heavy.Update:  6/25/14:  The phone was popping out when I had it in landscape mode with the retractable arm at the bottom.  Today, I tried it with the retractable arm at the top, and the phone did not pop out once.  I don't see a noticeable difference in the arms...so, I deduced that it is the sheer weight of the Note 3 that makes the retractable arm unable to keep from opening.  Makes sense, huh?  So, I'm changing my rating.  IF YOU ARE HAVING THE "POP OUT" ISSUE IN LANDSCAPE MODE, MAKE SURE THE RETRACTABLE ARM IS AT THE TOP.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C9QE3AQ" id="B00C9QE3AQ-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-27:</strong> I love this... it works wonderfully in my Chevy Volt.

My center dash has a bit to a curve on it and so I don't believe this mount is getting enough surface area to grab on to when I try and mount it.  It seemed to work okay for a few days with the largest adapter pad on it but now it quickly slips out when I go to mount my Samsung Galaxy S5.  I'm sure if I had a more flat shaped dash, this would work better for me.Even when it is mounted and holding its position, the layout of the dash has a circular 4-way button (U,D,L,R) right under the CD slot.  If I'm listening to the radio then I might see that the mount sinks or slips just enough that it begins pressing the up direction on this button and causing the stations to change.

For those of us that have moved on from the CD-world and have gone digital, it's nice to find a product that can utilize that slot in the dash of my car.  I have had problem after problem with the phone holders that try to stay suctioned to the windshield--as the hot and cold didn't agree with it, and they inevitably fell off---and always while you were using it.It takes about 2 minutes to install, and that includes opening the package.  This comes with 3 different pads that you place on the center &#34;wings&#34;, choosing one that most closely matches the slot height of your CD player.  Then, there is this little clamp on the bottom that &#34;locks&#34; it into place.  It doesn't engage the motor of the player itself, so it just sits there.And it's the same color as my dash (it's a soft dark grey).The phones (we have a Samsung Galaxy 3 and a HTC Droid DNA)--and no, I don't know if it will fit others--go to a phone store or Best Buy and compare your phone with one of the ones we have and you will have your answer--and they fit comfortably, and don't wiggle a bit.  The sides don't compress any button on the phones...a big plus over other holders I have had.It's infinitely adjustable (within reason, of course), so you can position your phone to your driving comfort.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C9QE3AQ" id="B00C9QE3AQ-review24" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-02:</strong> I've gone through a few of these reviews and I have to wonder if the writers are reviewing the same product. This mount requires significant effort to push into a CD slot. It has a locking lever on the back that spreads the holding fingers. With my current-generation Maxima, the mount is very stiff and secure with a Galaxy S4 and case. If my CD slot is all representative, I don't see how it could fall off.Relative to the Mountek nGroove, it's simply better in almost every way. You can mount and remove the phone with one hand. There's no ratcheting system, and nor is one necessary. It's physically smaller and with a low-profile build that looks better on the dash. The arm and ball-head have vastly greater flexibility than that of the nGroove; I had no trouble angling this one toward me in landscape or portrait. It vibrates slightly while driving and a bit more if you touch it, but it's stiffer than the nGroove, which shoves back with touch.The nGroove has a more versatile CD mount (in that the fingers can expand further), but at the expense of an ugly protruding knob. The locking lever for this mount has fixed travel, so if it doesn't hold (I don't see how this is possible, but for the sake of argument), you're out of luck. This appears to be the only advantage of the nGroove. Neither mount interferes with the S4's buttons.So far, I'd definitely recommend this product. I'll update if it gives me reason to suggest otherwise.UPDATE: It does occasionally rattle a bit over rough pavement. Not a big deal. Also, if it's been set in one position for a long time, the ball-head can get sticky such that the initial adjustment may take two hands. My S4 will slowly droop if the ball shaft is extended parallel to the ground. Shift it up a few degrees and it stays forever. It's now December: same as it was new.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C9QE3AQ" id="B00C9QE3AQ-review25" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-19:</strong> This one is better than Mountek nGroove which I have in my other car, the locking mechanism used on the Caseology is much more low profile and less intrusive allowing for more viewing on the CD players display.

Its perfect for what i need.. and its right there where it should be.. The only small problem I have is I have to take my case of the phone to use it... but that's a small problem... it holds it very securely and its not shaky art all..for those that have bought this.. or about to buy it.. it has three circular discs that insert into your CD slot.. the middle one has shims of different thickness that you use in accordance to your CD slot thickness.. I wish they did this for all three.. I think it would secure it even betterIf you are thinking of getting a cradle for your phone.. I would HIGHLY recommend this oneUPDATE: This is a great cradle.. I have a galaxy Note II and this holds it very solid... I used the extra rubber pads to secure it more... every now and then i have to fix it a little.. But I thinks that's just my carelessness of yanking my phone out of the cradle if I am running late... its not the cradle coming out by itself... this is a solid piece of technology...

It comes with three extra pads that make the part of the unit that grips the inside of your CD slot thicker, trying all three I could not get it to be secure enough that it would not just sag and either fall out or just be pulled out.

Doesn't bop around or lose grip even in my VERY still car over the crappy roads which municipalities seem to favor these days.

I'll never again buy a custom auto dock that's designed by a phone manufacturer for just one model of phone.  This Caseology car mount can handle any type of phone.  It'll even handle my wife's old Garmin GPS unit that she still likes to use but for which the original suction-cup mount has long since broken.  What's so great about this unit is its versatility.  You can put it pretty much anywhere and it sticks.  And it's adjustable to any angle.  Even if you're not using your phone for navigation and the screen is off, this unit offers a great place to just put your phone when you're in the car so it won't slide around on the seat or dash or take up a cup holder you could be using for a drink.  But if you need navigation or want to charge your phone while it's in this dock, just use your normal charger and plug the phone in.  It's great!  And it's not just a cheap piece of plastic.  It seems like it's well made.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C9QE3AQ" id="B00C9QE3AQ-review64" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-02:</strong> I bought it for use with my 2009 Prius.

By far, this is the best looking, best designed of them all.  I put this on my sports car, because it's old and it doesn't have any of that fancy dash navigation or entertainment center (which is how a sports car should be).Pros:1. Real nice design. Simple, easy to use, and it's precise in how they utilize the suction mechanism2. It accommodates a phone with a case on3. Spring on the expandable holder is fairly large. Large enough for any phone in the market4. Rubber grip on the holder part works good with the rubber case.5. the face rotates 360 and it has a very distinguished, "click" mechanism for adjusting it up and down6. Suction is designed very well. Even with the plastic cover, it was sticking to the counter pretty good. I think it's because of the lack of travel of the rubber piece, and pressure that's developed within the concave inner circle underneath the suction cupcons:1. Power source isn't integrated. So you have to manually connect the power wire to it, every time you're in the car2. The phone holding mechanism is a bit iffy. I know if I actually drive my car hard, there is a good chance, my phone will swing outside of the car (convertible)Really, that's about it.Conclusion: Really nicely made, expensive looking piece of car furniture (this is what I call most things like this). It's nice to not have to take the case out to use this, and it's nice to look at with careful consideration on user experience and user friendliness in design. It's very inviting and I just want to touch it and use it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C9QE3AQ" id="B00C9QE3AQ-review67" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-30:</strong> I've been looking forward to writing this review because because after recently purchasing the Mountec NGroove and experiencing it's poor quality vs expectations set by so many positive reviews, I was frustrated about the hassle of returning it.I was hesitant about ordering the Caseology One-Touch CD mount because, it is half the cost of the Mountek NGroove (http://www.amazon.com/Mountek-nGroove-Universal-Phones-Devices/dp/B004G1L52Q/ref=sr_1_2?s=electronics&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1398876113&sr;=1-2&keywords;=mountek). However, within minutes of receiving and install it, it was clear that this product beats the Mountek and probably most others (I own several mounts, so I'm qualified to make that statement).1) Easy to install. It stays on firmly to my CD player slot without me having the fear that it might cause damage.2) Once on, it says put and does not wobble (as the Mountek did).3) You can turn it to directly face the driver (unlike the Mountek).4) Very solidly put together. There are no rough edges or sense of cheapness about this.The only negative is that, unlike ratchet based cell phone mounts, the Caselogy uses a simple spring which you have pry apart with two hands when you insert it and take it out. That's very low-tech, but I still gave it 5 stars because all the positives far outweigh this one negative.If you're look for a CD Mount for your cell, and it'll fit the dimensions given in the item decision, you'll save a lot of time by just ordering this one.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C9QE3AQ" id="B00C9QE3AQ-review68" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-01:</strong> I like this product because it holds my phone and twists and turns and is really small and compact.

Not the best.Pros: Easy to attach to CD player slot.  Stays fairly secured inside slot.  Does not shake too much while driving.Cons: Not as easy to remove the cell phone, I have to use both hands.  One hand to pull the clip out while the other hand holds the cell phone.  If you swivel the phone around there is a slight chance the base will slide out of the cd slot.Summary:  It's not bad for the price, I think it's a convenience location to place the phone.  I have another phone holder for our other car and it is a suction cup style with a long arm.  Compared to the suction cup, this one is not bad because it kind of keeps the phone out of your view of the windshield.  I would recommend it for the price.  If it were more expensive then I'd research other products before deciding on this one.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C9QE3AQ" id="B00C9QE3AQ-review70" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-17:</strong> I have used many of these windshield holders including the green sticky ones at Walgreens and they all are trash!

Neat little idea.My only concern would be if I had a large case on the phone it may not fit into the holder- haven't tested it out yet, though since I only have slim cases.**UPDATE:After a little over a month it stopped holding in the cd slot.

It's small, sturdy and grips the phone securely even on the oldest roads in the country. I spent a few hours driving around Plymouth, MA the other day and if you are from the Northeast you know what the roads are like here. Potholes, dips, frost heaves and years of patchwork are the norms for many of the roads I travel. The holder had no problem hanging on to my phone regardless of the road.I can easily pop the phone in and out of the mount with one hand. I like the spring idea better than the other brand with the plastic gears and button system. If the springs wear out I'm sure I can find replacements at a hardware store or online for a few bucks.I read a few reviews complaining about the mount vibrating while driving. That worried me and caused me to spend hours  surfing reviews of this product and similar competitors before I bought it.  Well yeah, it does a bit, but not excessively. No more so than any other CD slot mount does according to the reviews from similar products. How could it not be perfectly still in a moving vehicle? It's really not noticeable unless you are staring at the phone waiting to see it vibrate over a rough road. It's not like your phone is going to be flapping around as you drive.The mount fits firmly in my aftermarket detachable face Kenwood deck. No chance of it falling or vibrating out. I like the little snap in handle that locks the mount into your CD slot. That was one of the main reasons I bought this over the kind with the big ugly screw. On my Kenwood much of the screen is still covered by the bottom of the mount. Obviously it depends on your screen location as far as this being an issue for you. Though it obscures much of my screen, it's no big deal because I don't need any of the info displayed on it.Pros: Sturdy yet light, grips CD slot firmly, grips phone securely, and of course the price. Sixteen ninety-nine with 2 day free shipping is a good deal for this device.Cons: Maybe block some of your screen. The mount does not respond to voice commands like &#34;fire missiles&#34; or &#34;turn stop light green&#34;. That's all I can think of.I'll be back to complain if this mount fails to satisfy me over the long haul, but as of now I would definitely recommend this to friends.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C9QE3AQ" id="B00C9QE3AQ-review84" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-14:</strong> I love it.

As I expected though; it will work loose after putting your phone in and out of it often. Simple give it a little nudge once in a while and it will stay in place.

It bubbles up all over and is hard to apply. I tried multiple times as did my wife. Couldn't get it on without bubbles and the 1st layer of the case pushes up the edges of the screen protector. I am currently using it without the screen protector. It is a rather bulky case and without an integrated screen protector I could receive the same protection from a case without all of the bulk.When the phone is in the holster face first it is well protected from drops or damage however it won't be dust proof. The holster has a locking clip just as many Seidio cases from the past did. The holsters normally make it 6-9 months with me before they break. The weak point is where the clip that holds the phone in the case hinges to the holster. It is all plastic and giving time it fails. Have had this happen with multiple Seidio cases in the past as far back as my 1st old school Blackberry Bold.  Unfortunately over the many years they have never changed the holster clip design.So when compared to the other cases out there I rate it as okay. All of the different brands of cases for different phones that I have owned all had some issues. The flaw with the non integrated screen protector and the weak clip/holster design really ruin the functionality of the case. Why all the bulk if it isn't bulletproof? If I had it to do over again I would not purchase this case. Due to the continued use of a weak hostler clip and the screen protectors I will likely not be ordering anything Seidio.

This one is ever better than that and the otterbox because it offers configurable protection for your phone.Just want a slim case for pocket carry? No problem, just take the rubber and stiff plastic layer off (the design is similar to an otterbox commuter case in that regard) and underneath is a nice slick matte black slim case that fits easily in a jeans pocket.Want full on protection for more rugged carry? Put the rubber and hard plastic skeleton over the slim case and you have full on drop protection. You can put it in the holster (which is easier to get the phone into and out of than an otterbox defender holster due to the spring clip that provides the retention), and you can even lock the holster so the phone cannot bounce out. I have actually strapped the holster to my mountain bike handlebars and locked the holster so I can use my phone as a bike computer.The only downside is the adhesive screen protector that comes with the case is not as good a quality as some of the better ones out there (Zagg, Tech Armor, Skinomi, etc) so plan on installing another one instead and using it with this case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004TS1JZY" id="B004TS1JZY-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-15:</strong> I used a similar Seidio case when I had my HTC Evo 4G, so I got this case when I got an iPhone 4S.  It protects the phone wonderfully, but has one flaw and one minor annoyance.  The flae is that the silicon outer case flexes a bit when you put it in the holster, so if you are not careful, you will have partially remove the case from the phone and not secured it to the holster.  Fortunately, if you know about the problem, you can keep your finger near the center of the case as you are inserting it into the holster, so the problem doesn't occur.  The minor annoyance is the small flap that is used to protect the camera lens.  When you open it, it doesn't always want to line up with the indentation that holds it open, requiring another attempt to put it in place.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004TS1JZY" id="B004TS1JZY-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-29:</strong> This thing is not going to keep your phone protected as well as a griffin. Nothing will keep it that safe for the money. I thought this would be close. No way!! To have 3 different layers of protection and then a cheap screen protector. That's not going to cut it for what i do. I do Landscape and mowing. I get grass, sand, and dirt on my phone everyday. It gets hit with rocks flying up from a weed eater.My Griffen with a real screen protector cleans up after work with NO scrapes. This does NOT fit the bill.The rubber second layer did not fit snug. The screen protector is as cheap as they come and holds AIR!! If you work out doors or in a trade. A Griffin survivor is the way to go.DON'T waste your time if your a man or woman that does real labor.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B004TS1JZY', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B004TS1JZY', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B006JTHGBM</h2>    <p class="price"> $B006JTHGBM</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006JTHGBM" id="B006JTHGBM-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-07:</strong> I bought this for my husband, It does not protect the front of the phone in any way so you will need screen protectors but it is a durable case.

Yet, it sometimes sticks out on it's own.  It is held in very tenuously and it breaks far too easily, for my, each time (twice now) within two months of purchase.  And I am not hard on these.Also, the corners, which are always the first to hit when you drop your phone, are almost completely uncovered, making it worthless in that regard.If you only plan to have it so that you can clip your phone to your belt it is fine.  But it will not protect your phone well from dropping, especially if it hits on the corners, and the stand in back (a would-be great feature) is hard to open, yet super flimsy and breaks easily).I have purchased it twice. I am not sure why. I guess I was giving the benefit of the doubt. I won't buy this one again.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006JTHGBM" id="B006JTHGBM-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-25:</strong> This one is a lot cheaper than what Verizon wanted for one and looks like the same thing!

Sorry for this being kind of an informal video review. I can't believe how good this feels on my hand. At first, I didn't want to get it because it didn't have the color I wanted. Since they came out in colors, I saw the blue one and it's my favorite color. The tip itself glides easily on my iPod touch screen and I know this would work great on an iPad. I'll probably get an iPad around the 2nd or 3rd gen, but until then, I shall use my touch for drawing and writing. It works surprisingly better than the BoxWave stylus. And it comes with a case to protect the stylus and the rubber tip of it so it'll protect it from damage unlike the unprotected Pogo Sketch, BoxWave, the Griffin and other similar styluses out there.

The AluPen works well on iPad2, although for me, while I think it's a great product, it's not quite as comfortable in my hand as my old plastic ThinkPad stylus.First, this pen is really well made, feeling like a solid block of aluminum with a small rubbery nosecone. It's hefty in your hand, and the little rubber nosecone, although somewhat large, has a good feel against the screen - not unlike the feel of a large marker. I do have a bit of trouble drawing precise fine lines...the rubbery tip makes it hard to know exactly where the line will draw, but I'm sure that's just me getting used to it.I have rather small hands, and the AluPen also feels a bit large and stubby. Reminds me of some of those fountain pens that feel like you're writing with a cigar. Nothing wrong with that - just personal preference whether you like thin or thick writing instruments.The other small gripe I have is that there's no easy way to attach the pen to your iPad, and I suspect it won't be long before I lose it or forget to bring it along. Still, I blame Apple for this one...seems like it would have been a pretty simple thing to build a little "garage" into the iPad so you can park your stylus when you're not using it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0042U9AT6" id="B0042U9AT6-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-16:</strong> This is the second one that I have ordered.

The "fake" AluPen looks identical, but does not have the black rubber dot at the top of the pen nor the "Just Mobile" brand name imprinted on it. Also unbalanced being heavier than the real Alu and its softer rubber pointer isn't as firm. I would describe the rubber tip as "blobbie" and thin. Also does NOT have nice black protective slip case, decals, nor authentic [Just Mobile] paper box and product brochure. Fake comes in clean plastic container, nothing more.

The finger, is certainly good for certain things but when it comes to doing much of what can be done on a 4 inch touch screen, you need the finger of a five year old in order to make it work as well as it can work. This is an aluminum/rubber version replicating that spec. The feel of the pen in terms of length, diameter and heft is really quite nice. The rubber tip in terms of sliding across the glass of a screen (using this with a Nexus S) is very smooth and very effective.In terms of typing, there have been, for me, fewer errors with this 'one finger' approach so the lack of need to correct offsets the extra finger lost and time may be shorter. The final kicker is no greasy smudge marks on that 'beautiful AMOLED screen'! Of course, you are always carrying your finger around with you and it is attached well so practically impossible to lose by forgetting or theft. The downside then for the Alupen  is, this is something else to carry around which can get lost and will probably deteriorate over time.The tip is one thing that sort of concerns me. It does not appear to be replaceable and is really nice and smooth now but seems like it could wear out or get ripped off the pen without something traumatic happening. Only time will tell with that. So you have to get over those factors or at least be prepared to deal with them in the event that the finger print grease and the mistyping or hitting the wrong key or wanting to draw more accurately is the driver behind looking for this sort of thing to begin with. I've not owned any of the other versions of this type of implement from other manufacturers with foam rubber type tips or anything else so no comparisons there.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0042U9AT6" id="B0042U9AT6-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-07:</strong> I really am enjoying this stylus.  I like the &#34;thickness&#34; because it gives the pen some heft, yet the point is thin enough for making thin lines if needed.  I use it mostly for sketching and drawing.

I've been very frustrated with the limitations of other units, so it's nice to have a stylus that works so well.The feel of the stylus, weight/size/balance, is very good.  It very much reminds me of a sketching pencil (the heavier, graphite style ones).  It moves smoothly over the screen and is very easy to use.Only downside so far...I've found that the tip quickly becomes off-center; it's kind of crooked and pushed to one side.  I'm not pressing down hard so I'm not sure why it is like that and it doesn't go back when I use that side so....  I am also getting some misses on one of my drawing apps but I don't think that's the stylus.  It comes with am extra tip, so I may try that and see if maybe the tip was just bad.All in all, I have to give this one four stars.  It is definitely the best of all the ones I've tried to date</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0042U9AT6" id="B0042U9AT6-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-12-22:</strong> The AluPen is more than a stylus.

First, I wanted to be able to take written notes in my ASUS Transformer Prime.  Second, I wanted to be able to sketch/draw.  Most importantly, I wanted to be able to do these things better than I could with the first, inexpensive stylus I purchased.  After reading reviews of several options, I settled on this one.  While I would have preferred to have been able to test all of the ones I read about, that wasn't financially an option.  In the end, until capacitive screens and related technology improve to be more "sketch" friendly, this stylus does about as good as is possible.  It definitely solved the problem I had with my other stylus, which was a need to press far too hard to make a continuous line.  It also allows me to hold it at an angle while still generating contact.  Whereas my other stylus has to be almost perfectly perpendicular to the screen to function well.  As an added bonus, this one is pretty easy to spot and is pretty stylish, despite the heft.UPDATE 6 December 2012:  After months of semi-regular use, the rubber nib completely detached from my pen.  Apparently, there are two models and I, unfortunately, had one of the older one that makes it very difficult to get the nib back on.  I contacted Just Mobile's customer service and, despite me owning the pen for 10 months, they agreed to "repair or replace" it.  I sent it in and within 10 days had my pen back, fully functional again.  Companies with this kind of quality customer service will get my business again.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0042U9AT6" id="B0042U9AT6-review21" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-06-14:</strong> I've tried many iPad styluses but was never quite happy with any of 'em due to how they felt or how they just wouldn't respond to what I wanted it to do. Basically, we want the stylus to feel like a smooth ballpoint pen on paper. I decided to give the AluPen a try based on all the glowing reviews and I must concur that this is the smoothest and best feeling iPad stylus I've tried to date. Haven't tried the new one from Wacom but I think I'll be happy with the AluPen for a long time to come.I was initially concerned with the bulk and the heft of this stylus but I believe that's what gives AluPen its very solid and smooth feel. It glides over the surface without you having to press down on the stylus. I highly recommend it to anyone who works a lot with a stylus on the iPad. The quality is superb and it does exactly what you expect a stylus to do, making the iPad that much more useful and fun to use.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0042U9AT6" id="B0042U9AT6-review22" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-22:</strong> I like the unique shape and good weight to the product.

I wanted to give it over with a new clean case so I ordered this one in Turquoise, the color is nice, not to bright, and I didn't have any trouble with the removable hard layer. The TPU is a bit more rigid than something you would get from Cruzerlite.The biggest CON with this case is the shape. This case is designed to make your Note 2 more angular around the sides so the nice curve that helps the bigger than average Note 2 seat nicely in your hand is all but eliminated. This case actually adds extra bulk to the phone. Also because the case overextends all around, it completely dwarfs you s-pen slot making it almost impossible to slide out the s-pen if you have short trimmed nails. While I was able to pull out the s-pen by sticking my skinny finger in the space, my brother's slightly thicker fingers couldn't even fit in to pull out the s-pen. If you dislike large, thick, unwieldy phones then don't buy this case because it will transform you Note 2 into one.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EZW2AV6" id="B00EZW2AV6-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-09:</strong> I love the look and feel of this case.

The case itself feels a bit sharp-edged but it's still comfortable to hold. As far as a case for my Note 2 is concerned, I don't find myself using this one much because of how bulky it feels in my pocket. I wear scrubs to work and my phone is already big enough in my pocket.

That's not specific to this screen protector, rather to all of them that use adhesive.They also seem to be just a touch smaller than the phone.  However, the last protector I tried had an overhang; not having to trim it is nice.  The silicone case I keep on my phone covers the parts that the screen protector does not cover.Someone on a forum I'm on suggested using scotch tape to remove any dust/lint/etc that gets trapped under the screen.  I'm OCD about having zero bubbles under it; the scotch tape trick removed every speck of dust, even specks that had stuck to the protector.Since I have no bubbles under mine, and a silicone case on the phone, you can't even tell there's a screen protector on it unless you see the cutouts for the speaker and front camera.It does smudge a little easier than the bare glass; I'd rather have to clean it a bit more often than deal with scratches.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004OORO9I" id="B004OORO9I-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-16:</strong> When I received this product, it did not stick to the phone so it was of no use to me fortunately it was only a few bucks but still it didn't work.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004OORO9I" id="B004OORO9I-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-14:</strong> The product works as described at a great price and very easy to apply to the screen just make sure the screen is clean and no fingerprints!!

I had no trouble applying the protector, but other reviewers mentioned getting a cleaning cloth with each protector, and these came with only one. It is a nice cloth, so as long as I don't lose it, I think it will continue to work for all 5 protectors.  The little cardboard squeegee was not included with these, so I just used my fingernail.  That seemed to get out almost all of the bubbles.  The few tiny bubbles that remain are close to the edges and usually disappear on their own after a few days.The only drawbacks I notice are:1. The protector seems much thinner than previous protectors I have used for other devices. I think I may have to replace this one more often- time will tell.2. The entire screen is not covered.  The protector stops a little more than an eighth of an inch short at the top.  The cutouts do fit well, but the protector doesn't extend all the way to the top. This may be due to the slight curve of the Nexus S screen.3. The protector does not seem to be sticking at the very bottom, due to the curved screen. I couldn't move the protector up any higher on my phone, because the cutouts at the top wouldn't fit if I did. I think that once I get my new silicone cover on the phone the edges will probably be covered anyway.  I just wonder if dust might get in and cause me to have to replace the protector more quickly.I will probably look at other options when it comes time to buy again.  I would like the protector to be just a bit thicker, and possibly cover more of the top of the screen.Just noticed the picture on the listing shows a different protector than I received. The ones I received don't have a rounded top; the cutouts are open at the top. This is why my protectors don't reach all the way up. There must be a difference in sellers, or maybe the template was changed. I will definitely look for ones that extend the next time I buy.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B004OORO9I', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B004OORO9I', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B007TNBRVW</h2>    <p class="price"> $B007TNBRVW</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007TNBRVW" id="B007TNBRVW-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-11:</strong> Good price, good item, good service what more you want?Good price, good item, good service what more you want?</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007TNBRVW" id="B007TNBRVW-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-03:</strong> Very good quality ipad case for a decent price.

My original battery was slowly dying, so I decided to buy this one and get more juice. Since day one, battery has a horribly short life. I charge my phone overnight, 100% charged, unplug it and go to work. I pull the phone off my purse and in 20 minutes it has dropped to 70%. 3 hrs later, without it being used at all (while at work, my phone stays in my locker) and it already is less than 30%.  My husband thought that maybe some app was running in the background, so went as far as taking ALL the apps off the phone. Same thing, battery doesn't last more than 6-8 hrs. It also makes my phone very hot.  Very disappointing product. Do not recommend it all. Now I am going to have to buy a regular battery and spend more money.Update on issue. 05/10/14So, I contacted the seller and explained my problem and I got this response:Hello,I apologize for your dissatisfaction with our product. I can certainly shipyou a replacement package, free of charge, or issue you a refund, if you prefer.However, we do require the products getting returned to us, so we can test theitem for our manufacturer to see if it is a bigger issue than just thisincident.  If you could please send the items back with a receipt of postagecosts (so we can compensate you if the item is deemed defective or incorrect),your Amazon Order ID number, and the course of action you wish to be taken whenwe receive your package (Reshipment/Refund).I purchased my battery on March 22nd and it was delivered on April 1st. Then, I wrote again letting them know I was sending the battery and I got this response:Hello,I apologize, we only offer a 30 day return policy. If you have been using thebattery we would not be able to accept the return.Why offer a replacement/refund and then go back on your word like that? I have to use the battery to know if it works or not, common sense. They were aware of the time frames at all times. At the time they said they were going to replace it, it was past 30 days and still they made the offer.I do not recommend this seller or product at all.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006ARYDK0" id="B006ARYDK0-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-04:</strong> This was my second large capacity battery, and I was attracted by the price.

Given a single day at disney and the recent MLP Gameloft game caused the factory battery on My Galaxy S II 4g to last barely more than five hours, I knew I needed something stronger and better.I know there are a lot of other batteries available, and one that had higher mAh's that rated highly; however, at this time I simply could not justify spending close to $40 USD + shipping when this one was not near that much at this time; There was also the aesthetic issue, in where at least the door provided with this battery does fit very neat and snug with the form on the back of the phone.On the downside however, I can't say I've been seeing the kind of glorious battery life that most dumb phones enjoy, or even that like my old Transform Ultra experienced when I upgraded its battery. I understand I still haven't done enough full cycles to fully train it yet, but the first couple of cycles only really netted about 10 hours of what I would call heavy use. As said, the MLP Gameloft app is surprisingly taxing and can really drain a battery hard. I've yet to have the opportunity to test how it is with regard to 4G data usage as of this writing. However,  as I am writing this, I'm currently @ 40% charge, 9h31m,17s on battery, 2h23m32s of screen on time. Each full charge cycle, it is doing better... I was just hoping it would be doing like 2-3 days per charge cycle better...</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B006ARYDK0', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B006ARYDK0', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B0075WLO60</h2>    <p class="price"> $B0075WLO60</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0075WLO60" id="B0075WLO60-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-23:</strong> I love it.

In comparison to the Samsung Captivate, the Samsung Skyrocket has a much bigger screen but feels lighter, has a more than capable processor as well as sufficient RAM (hence the phone never freezes or lags), it has greater battery capacity, and I can use a 32GB MicroSDHC card. I use a Diztronic Matte Back Clear Flexible TPU Case made for the Skyrocket (available on Amazon). Most people mistake the phone for the Galaxy S III.  The two complaints I have about the phone: 1) the screen can run hot and 2) battery life is not stellar if you are actively using your cell or wi-fi signals. I would recommend definitely recommend this phone to mid-range to high end users, especially if the price is right.

Since this phone has EXCEEDED all of my expectations, here is my very detailed review of this very special and fun to use Skyrocket S2 phone. Although I paid more to purchase this phone NEW, I am very glad that I did so as it is working wonderfully! My goal in this review is to help in your buying decision one way or the other regarding this phone.PROS:- SIZE AND WEIGHT: Perfect size for me (with a 4.5" viewing screen like the S3 has). For me, I keep this phone inside a case and cover and it still fits easily into a rather small purse. And also I take it with me to the gym to listen to my music when I work out. Since the phone is lightweight, it is easy to wear on my waistband (in the storage case).- Unlocked Sim - Yes, the phone I received is NEW and I tested the Sim slot to make sure it was unlocked. First I inserted my neighbors T-Mobile standard Sim card (she has a pre-paid plan with no data plan). I simply popped it into the phone and it worked right out of the box, called someone and it worked great. Sent a text (with no pictures or attachments, just text and went fine). Then I removed her Sim and placed my own AT&T; Activated Sim card (Standard sized card). With the T-Mobile and AT&T; Sim cards, this phone worked perfectly as the phone is SIM UNLOCKED, the basic AT&T; Logo is still there, the original AT&T; Apps still there. But you can use say T-Mobile, Straight Talk, or MOST GSM Sim cards should work just fine--just make sure you buy the UNLOCKED ONE not the locked to AT&T; one.However, if you want to use anything other than AT&T;, please contact me in comments for the APN settings for Data and MMS as I have all the settings.One more thing if it says UNLOCKED rather than International Unlocked, it means that JUST THE SIM CARD SLOT is Unlocked for most GSM Standard Sized Sim Cards but still shows the AT&T; Logo on the top front of the phone. Since I did not do anything on my neighbors Sim card but make a quick call and try it for about 30 minutes (she is thinking about buying this phone for herself and using T-Mobile as she does not an AT&T; Account). Also, if you use WiFi like I do, no need for data unless you are in an out of WiFi area a lot of the time. For me, I am around WiFi 95 to 99 percent of the time!- LARGE SCREEN WITH GOOD RESOLUTION - This absolutely gorgeous screen measures 4.5 inches (seems larger) and it is just the right sized screen. Before this phone I used to use a Galaxy Note and Grand (both had 5 inch or more screens), both were too big, heavy and bulky. Now, I am using the S2 Skyrocket as the screen is large and has good resolution with 207 ppi (pixels per inch) and higher is better. This has a very sharp screen with easy to read screen. It looks to me as sharp as my old Galaxy Note I did and MUCH MUCH sharper than my Galaxy Grand (which just had 187 ppi and it was not as clear as the S2 Skyrocket) so that extra 20 pixels per inch makes a big difference in my opinion. Again, this screen is so vivid and clear!- STANDARD REGULAR SIZE SIM CARD: This phone has a regular/standard Sim card slot. (Note the S3 regular phone and S4 phones accept a micro Sim. So glad that this phone accepts a regular/standard Sim.-- Phone call clarity etc. - No matter what my location using this phone for phone calls the clarity of calls is loud and clear whether on the phone's speaker, headset etc. I even had to turn down the volume quite a lot as the calls come in so well.- WiFi/3G (Internet): Connects to any WiFi I have tried very quickly and easily. (For browser, I installed Opera Mini free from Playstore and found it to be a very easy to use and fast browser).- Overall speed, performance, smoothness, picture quality of the screen--very fast and peppy. And I found a way to SAVE on both memory and on battery. What I did was to go into Apps/ Manage Apps and DISABLED the apps I don't use. Without rooting the phone, you cannot uninstall pre-installed factory apps, but you can disable them. Disabling the ones you don't use makes the phone run faster and frees more memory! Since I am a techie, I know which ones to disable and which ones not to disable, so if in doubt, please ask me in the comments and I will be glad to assist you in this.- BATTERY LIFE: This phone has given me the ONE OF THE BEST battery life of ANY smartphone or that I ever owned. And I use 100% brightness. For me, even at 100 brightness, if I use WiFi when I need it and then turn it off, I get all day into the night on one single charge! (I charge nightly and the phone is at 100% ready to go the next morning).- EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD - This helped to sell me on this phone as I can add my personal music, photos, videos and more to this phone!And I placed a 32g in mine for music, files etc. *Keep in mind where External SD cards are concerned: They are JUST for your personal files: music, videos, photos, and other files. When you install apps from Playstore or other sources, they store either in INTERNAL Memory Card or sometimes in the phone area (most store in the INTERNAL SD AREA). This is the law of the land where Android is concerned and ALL newer Android devices (including Samsung) work this way when storing your downloaded apps are concerned.- INTERNAL STORAGE SPACE:This phone is advertised at 16GB of Internal space. The 16GB is the space BEFORE the drive was formatted, OS installed and then factory apps installed. So what I had on the phone BEFORE I installed any apps it had 10.75GB left. This is how it is on any flash drive, SD card, Hard Drive as formatting alone takes up space.Also, since 3.0 Android and above, you cannot save any apps to your personal SD card. Instead the apps are installed one way or the other to the INTERNAL SPACE. However, the good thing is that your personal files as photos, music, videos, and more can be installed to your EXTERNAL SD Card so you do have that space for yourself.**I have a few apps I downloaded from the Playstore, but no games so I still have about 4.08 GB left on my phone for more apps later should I wish to install them.- CAMERA - The 8MP camera concerned me that is UNTIL I took both indoor and outdoor pictures and even video. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. When I printed out some close up and other shots, I was really happy with the detailing in the pictures. Turns out to be a very good camera.- Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth paired quickly with several devices and copied files at a great rate of speed.- OTG (On the go) USB plug for flash drives, mice, etc. For me, I use an OTG Micro Adapter (S3 and S4 ones work) and am able to plug in a flash drive, mouse and more. Could not get my portable Hard Disk to work, but flash drives work fine.- NFC (Near Field Communication) has been advertised to work on this phone. Have not yet tried this feature.CONS:- No built in FM Radio like the regular SII has. Not a problem because I installed TuneIn Radio (free) from the Playstore and I can play lots of radio (FM or other) when WiFi is on.- Adobe Flash is not supported in this phone or ANY ANDROID DEVICE after 4.0 OS. The only way to get flash is to get a archived flash and use a high end browser such as Puffin or Maxthon Browser. So downloading the older archived flash gives the ability to view SOME internet videos, but this is better than no flash at all. Keep in mind this is a problem with ALL brands of Android devices with 4.0 OS and higher it is just after 4.0 Android came out, the NEW and best flash is NOT supported for Android devices. It is what it is...Bottom line: Would I buy this phone all over again? Yes I certainly would. Hope this review has assisted you and thank you for reading it. Please feel free to ask me any questions in the comment area and I will answer all questions in a very timely manner.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0075WLO60" id="B0075WLO60-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-12:</strong> Perfect all across the board.

My daughter wants multiple cases and I wasn't prepared to spend a ton on each one so this seems a good option. The case is less flexible than the apple brand but for the savings in cost I am OK with that. One thing I like better about this case is that with this one you can see the apple logo. With the poor Apple design of showing only a small portion of the writing on the back of the case (instead of blocking it all??) the original is also disappointing in this respect. Over all I am very pleased with this case. I would give it a 5 star but the case is getting a little dirty and may be due to it feeling as if it is more textured than the apple case. However, I will 'wash' it and see if it comes clean.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FA5OV8W" id="B00FA5OV8W-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-12:</strong> The case itself is pretty good, I got this for my Pink iPhone 5C and it fits well and offers fair protection.  My only problem is that when I got it I thought it would match the phone but it doesn't.  The two different pinks clash pretty badly.  I actually like the pink of the case better than the pink of the phone (which is more like a coral color than pink) but I definitely recommend the case it's simple and works well for a great price.

The texture of the black cover is much less slippery than the stock grey cover that came with my 9810. Also much easier to remove the black cover.

Top reviewers are often asked to review new battery packs and one of the benefits of being asked to test different power banks is that it gives me an opportunity to compare them to each other using the same charging test, so I can compare them using "apples to apples" comparison. This set of tests allows me to provide unbiased results as the numbers speak for the performance of each unit.I received two identical units black and blue, having two of them allows me to test for consistency in manufacturing. Ideally I want to see the same performance numbers for both units when testing the same device, and this was the case with these two units.My methodology is to charge each mobile device on each port of the unit for 10 minutes and measuring how much each unit was charge in that 10 minute period. In addition I tested charging two mobile devices at the same time. Each line in the table below represents a separate 10 minute test. I use Battery App by Elvison to determine how each device recognized the charging source. 'AC' status means the charging is at full charging rate. 'USB' status indicates charging at a lower charging rate. 'Discharging' status means that the charging rate is below the power that the device is consuming so it slows down the discharge rate but does not re-charge.&#10152; General features:======================iFlash 5600mAh external battery weighs 4.4 oz. Its size is 3.75" x1.75" x 0.875". The pack has one USB output port. It comes with a pouch which fits the power pack, cables and tips. It has a built-in flashlight.The external battery comes with a charging cable and 5 tips - micro USB, mini USB and iPad (and two others I don't recognize). It did not have tips for Samsung Galaxy Tab or lightening connector for iPad Mini and I used my own charging cables during the tests. I am attaching a photo of Flash 5600mAh during one of the test next to my tablet for size reference.

This power pack does not work with iPad Mini. I observed the same performance for both the black and blue model, which is good and reflects consistency in the manufacturing process.

I've been testing and playing with several of them with different mAh values.  Mind you, I take the more informal approach to testing and always figure that if a battery can power up my iPad, no doubt they'll work on smaller devices such as Kindles, Smartphones, iPhones, etc. One thing I immediately noticed when I've opened the boxes was the high-quality connectors and cables. Many of the higher mAh battery packs are including the "extras" now, something I appreciate. The 30-pin Apple connector is quite solid as is the accompanying cable.FLASH Performance:Start: 27% (4 LEDs)15 minutes 31% (4 LEDs)30 minutes 35%45 minutes 40%60 minutes 43%75 minutes 46% (3 LEDs)90 minutes 52%115 minutes 56%  (2 LEDs)145 minutes 61%160 minutes 68%  (1 LED)175 minutes 73%190 minutes 77%205 minutes  82%  (flashing)220  minutes 87%The battery finally ran out of juice, but the performance was really impressive for a 5600mAh battery pack.  Mind you, I didn't sit on it watching it every second as it charged, but was quite surprised at how hard to work to try to get my iPad back up to snuff.  It finally gave up the ghost, but it really packed an unexpected wallop.  It's a small, sleek unit and could easily be carried in a purse, knapsack, or briefcase. The top of the battery pack has the four LED indicators. Beneath that on the front side is the small LED flashlight, and one output port.  I suspect that LED flashlight would be able to stay on for more than 200 hours continuously given the power of this battery (just a guess). It's small, but would be great in emergency situations. On the right-hand side panel is the micro 5-pin input port.  The power switch is conveniently on the top face.WHAT'S IN THE BOX:1. Power Bank 5600mAh2. PSP connector3. Nokia DC 2.0 connector4.

I am a hard user of these devices, so far the iFlash has been holding up very well.  The ONLY improvement is to build the microUSB charging cord right into the device - those devices are my go to since I don't have to hunt down a charging cord. The charging cord that comes with the iFlash (You can use any USB cable) includes adapters for mini and micro usb, apple 30 pin, nokia 2mm, psp3, etc. Also comes with a wall wart to recharge the iFlash. The iFlash can recharge most any device with a USB cable including GPS units, small radios, MP3 players, cell phones, some cameras and Sony handycams, etc. I keep a small USB lamp handy for power outages - just plug it into the iFlash for emergency lighting.I am very satisfied with this backup battery, I received this device for reviewing purposes and so far it has outperformed similar devices I have reviewed previously.  If anything changes, such as  malfunction, I will update this review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BRTQKDO" id="B00BRTQKDO-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-16:</strong> A power bank is essentially a portable battery charger; sometimes it's referred to as an external battery. You charge the power bank and take it with you to charge your mobile devices when their battery power runs low. This is especially handy for the times you're on the go & don't have access to a power source to charge your mobile device.The iFlash 5600mAh power bank is black with a white band that wraps around 3 sides; it comes with a white USB cable, 5 white connector tips (Nokia, Apple 30 pin, Micro USB, Mini USB & PSP3) & a nice sky blue case which fastens to keep the extra tips, etc. from falling out. It arrived with an almost full charge so it was ready to use right out of the box. With an output of 1A, charging will be a little slower than some power banks. This charger is great for trips around town because of its lightweight, slim design.My Kindle Fire HD's battery went from 20% to 74% in 4 hours when I charged it as soon as the iFlash 5600 arrived in the mail. The iFlash's LED 25% LED indicator began blinking just before the power bank's energy was depleted.  I also charged my iPod Touch & LG Cosmos phone using the iFlash 5600.Charges one device at a time. Press the power button to begin charging your device. I used the included USB cable & the appropriate connector tip to charge my devices. Press the power button twice to turn the LED flashlight on/off. The LED flashlight will operate 180 hours when the power bank is fully charged.To charge the power bank, connect the included USB cable to the micro USB connector tip & plug it in to the power bank's In port. The power bank can be charged using your PC or a USB AC adapter (not included).Approximate measurements:Weight: 4.5 oz.Measures: 1 3/4" x 7/8" x 3 5/8"Handy, portable power bank. It performed perfectly for me. I love its lightweight, slim design...and the LED flashlight!

The first protectors I had came with my case that I had gotten off ebay, and worked really well, but I did manage to put a gash in those. Then I tried the Ringbo protectors available on Amazon, and hated those due to defective material and ridiculous amount of that &#34;rainbow streak.&#34; I tired Fosmon and those had ever worse rainbow streaking, and were ridiculously cheap quality (suuuuuper thin and flimsy, I cannot exaggerate that enough). So I tried going without a protector for a while, but it just felt too dangerous without because of lint and dust in my pockets (remember its actually smaller debris like dust that causes scratches, not really larger objects). So I figured for less than 2$, about the same price as Fosmon, but a different brand, I'd give it a try... and it was worth it.First of all, lets get the negatives out of the way. This does have rainbow streaking as well, but it is a lot less than what I saw on the more expensive Ringbo protectors, and a lot more less than the Fosmon brand. Then durability wise, it is still on the flimsy thin side, but should be enough to hold up to scratches. Another negative is the placement of the sticker tabs that adhere to the films that protector the protector and are suppose to help the application process. They were put on the top where the ear piece and front facing camera cut outs are, so it is hard to line it up straight using that edge. I'd recommend the makers to put the tabs on the bottom edge so it's easier to line that edge up.Positives? You get 3 for less than 2$. Next, the fit. Compared to the Ringbo, these fit well, almost too well to the point it is difficult to actually apply due to Nokia's design of using raised edges (use that to your advantage though, line one edge up and the rest should fall to place). Next is the feel. I just did a general &#34;feel&#34; test, using the screen without and the screen with, and I don't notice a difference. With the Ringbo protectors, there was an added noticeable drag, and it was really annoying when you would play games that required dragging, like Bonnie's Brunch. These just feel exactly like the glass, which is really nice. These are also really clear too, I would say that 99.9% clarity from these.So for less than 2$, for all those positive, and really small negatives, I give this a 4/5 stars. It could be a near perfect product, but really for the amount you are paying you could just replace them for little cost.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0079CIEZA" id="B0079CIEZA-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-25:</strong> this product is of a high quality and the installation of the screen was very easy to do and hassle free.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0079CIEZA" id="B0079CIEZA-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-10:</strong> Game in a reasonable amount of time through the mail.

The design is faux crock skin, tinted blue. It replaces the stock back cover and does a pretty decent job of keeping the phone from getting banged up and finger smudges all over the back. A spritz of Windex and a paper towel and things look like new once again. The case itself is somewhat flexible, unlike other cases that are extremely rigid and prone to breaking/snapping. It also feels quite natural in the hand, instead of the slick plastic backing.Overall, if blue and crock skin are your thing, this is your baby.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00ALR3R3O" id="B00ALR3R3O-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-14:</strong> I really like the feel of this case.

Having big fingers, this made it difficult to apply correctly. It took a few tries. There were tons of bubbles that did mostly disappear after more than a day. Initially, it looked terrible when screen was off. I removed the screen protector this morning after not liking the "feel" of it as I used the touch screen. I have been using the phone without any screen protector and after several texts, I noticed there are no finger prints or smudges on the screen at all. I guess the Gorilla Glass works pretty well. Rethinking needing a protector at this time.I had used a screen protector on my previous phone from day one and it worked fine and had a smooth feel to it You really need the tabs to properly apply in my opinion, which this item doesn't have.update 100812..  I must say after using another brand of protector, I actually applied one of these to my phone. One thing I have noticed isthere is far less fingerprints and smudges with this protector versus the other one. It is difficult to pply and you have to wait a day or so for the bubbles to disappear, but not having to wipe your phone every few minutes is a big plus. I will probably end up buying more of this type.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009BBD8RG" id="B009BBD8RG-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-11:</strong> Was just as described, easy to apply to the screen.

As the official description points out, this one has a distinctive pen feel on your screen surface. You can smoothly draw and/or precisely select icons. The 3M Smart Pen's highly sensitive capacitive tip makes it ideal for use with your iPad, iPod touch, iPhone and many other touchscreen devices.  The 3M pen reduces fingerprints, is lightweight and unlike most that I have used, requires no power or software.  It has a clip that attaches to a protective case or shirt. It is the combination of high-quality and advanced materials engineering that helps optimize the interaction between you and your touch screen stuff. As the package indicates, the pen features:* Precise touch over the entire display, even in the corners* Anti-stiction pen tip* Draw, write, and drag smoothly* Reduces fingerprints and smudging* No power or software required* One year limited warrantyIt is compatiable with:Apple iPhone 1/2/3G/S/4,Apple iPod,Apple iPad,Google Nexus One,HTC Desire,HTC HD2,Motorola XoomSamsung Galaxy S,Samsung Galaxy Tab,Sony Ericsson Xperia X10 / X10 miniThe silver 3M pen measures 8.4mm / .33 inches  X  118.2mm / 4.65 inches.

The pen worked well on my tablet but the3 Pack of Universal Touch Screen Stylus Pen (Red + Black + Silver)were almost as good (thinner, lighter and about 1/2 inch shorter) for about 1/15th of the Smart's price.Some other issues:- It's not 'smart' at all. All you get is an inert, metal-body pen-like object with a soft tip. The smarts are all on the tablet side. I don't understand why the word 'smart' in the product's name.- It's a little too heavy. Combine 'weight' and 'metal body' and think what could happen to your tablet's glass screen.- It doesn't come with a cap to protect the soft tip when not in use. Neither do the under-one-dollar alternatives but... those are under-one-dollar pens.The 'smart' pen loses 3 stars for the reasons outlined above, especially for being grossly overpriced and for using a marketing buzzword (smart) that has absolutely nothing to do with the product's features.__________________________________Update:After some 10 days of use the pen's top (the part that has the 3M logo on it) separated itself from the body. Nothing that a little glue couldn't fix but it's not a good statement of quality. One would expect a durable product at this price point.

I like this stylus better than the PoGp -- it has a little more weight and heft to it (I can't stand no-weight writing instruments), not to mention a firmer sponge tip (I always hated the way the PoGo tip smushed and spread the second you touched the screen). The responsiveness is really good, and it glides nicely across my iPad's screen. I also like the burnished metal finish.My only complaint is a complaint that I think all the available styluses out there share: the tip is not pin-point accurate enough to handwrite with, or even to do precision sketching with.

The packaging should be easier to open and it really MUST be recyclable. 3M you have no excuse for doing this at this stage.I tried the pen on my HTC Thunderbolt and it works really well. My fingers are broad enough that I often have problems hitting the right key on the keyboard, or the right web link, especially when the page comes up in tiny font. Both of these tasks were really easy with the 3M pen. That alone makes it worthwhile to carry around. But the price tag is really steep for a single pen. If there were two in the package, I'd have more flexibility.The clip on the pen won't work well on thick shirt fabric, it takes some effort to get it apart enough.I also wish the pen itself was a little thicker. Like many folks I've migrated to chunkier pens with plastic/rubber grips. I'd like to have seen this option in a different pen model.My overall rating is 3.5 stars. I'd have made it a real 4 stars if they improved the packaging.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0054R1EY0" id="B0054R1EY0-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-08-04:</strong> I'm trying real hard to like the 3M Smart Pen, but my finger just works better.

Likewise there are basically two ways to write on an iPad-stylus or fingers. Fingers work just fine, but there are those whose personality compels them to use a proper writing utensil.3M is a company famous for Scotch tape and Post-its. Styli (the plural of stylus I hope) are just not the kind of things one normally associates with an enterprise which if you were to exclude cranberry bogs and dairy cows accounts for at least 30% of the Gross Domestic Product of the state. So the real question is whether by entering the multitouch styli business the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company can seize an extra per cent of the state's GDP.My bet is it can. Multitouch devices like the iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch and somethings called Droids are wildly popular even in China where they are made. The market for a good device for entering data daintily is vast. This stylus is perfect. First of all it is round. Secondly it has a clip where you can attach it to your shirt pocket, or to the more adventuresome, to a pocket protector. The weight is a bit heaver than the competition, aTen One Design Pogo Sketch stylus for iPad, iPhone and iPod touch (Hot Pink). It's color is less shocking-steel gray instead of hot pink.

One problem with the iPad is the constant cleaning. My hand, with sweat, lotion and sometimes just plain dirty make the shiny screen of the iPad looks terrible! This pen is the cure of all that. The soft tip guarantees that you will not scratch the surface and gives you a lot more precision in navigating pages.You can use it for sketching with apps such as Bamboo Paper, or writing note with One Note. Of course, if you want to pinch and stretch, you need to use your fingers.  It is also small enough to put in your pocket, I wish I have a case that includes a pen holder.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0054R1EY0" id="B0054R1EY0-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-09-07:</strong> I wanted to use my android phone as a as a small digital sketch pad but couldn't do so when I only had a big and pretty clumsy finger for a pen.I researched styluses for touch screen devices and soon realized that picking a good one is no easy task. Many require hard pressing, have rubber tips that drag on the screen surface or simply don't register dragging at all only touches like button presses.So when the opportunity to try this product by 3M I jumped at the chance. The type of stylus I needed was capacitive for a modern smart phone or tablet and this fit the bill. 3M are known for quality and I figured this would be no exception.The stylus is a nice size, shorter and slightly thinner than a regular pen. The length about the same as my Android galaxy S type phone, it has a soft spongy ball at the end with what I imagine is the real tip inside.  The tip is round and if it was a little thinner, it would be better, but it is thinner than all the other styluses I have seen by other manufacturers. The soft spongy material is supposed to be made of some kind of anti friction material and it works. There is no drag on the screen surface so movement is smooth. In fact it's smoother than a finger which tends to be slightly oily at the best of times. Sensitivity is very good; not quite as good as your finger but almost and you can press very lightly and still make a mark.I have an android phone and my preferred drawing/painting app is Autodesk Sketchbook Mobile which is a fairly sophisticated and has features like thickness of line varying with speed. The stylus works very well with it and because it never catches on the screen surface you get a very smooth elegant line. It works better than I had hope and is a joy to use.I did have one odd problem that the stylus didn't have as good accuracy when the phone was charging its battery. It was still good but didn't work as well.Overall, this is a very good product.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0054R1EY0" id="B0054R1EY0-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-08-08:</strong> The tip has a focused point, which some users like.

The Evo 3D has a great response when touched with a finger, but there are times when I prefer to use a stylus - after putting on hand lotion, when reading on the Evo 3D while eating, etc. It's nice to have a good stylus that allows you to use your device without dirtying the screen.I've tried four different capacitive touch stylus pens in the last month and two that worked OK, one that worked a little less than OK, and one that works really well. The best of the four that I've tried is the "3M Smart Pen - Grey Clip-On Design - Precision Touch Pen for Mobile Handheld Devices".The first thing I noticed is the comfortable feel. At approximately 4.5 inches in length, it is a good fit, versus some others that are too short to use comfortably. The weight is also nice, not to heavy, not so light it is flimsy.The packaging touts an "anti-stiction pen tip". I've never heard the word `stiction' before, but I assume they are boasting a smooth writing experience. Whether that's what it means or not, I can verify that the tip moves very smoothly across the capacitive touch screen of my HTC Evo 3D smartphone. The device responds will to all commands I send using this stylus - sometimes better than with my finger, I think. My Angry Birds game has never been better! LOLI want to mention that I useGraffiti(R) Pro for Androidas my input method when writing on the EVO 3D. As that software requires you draw each character and command, a responsive touch experience is a must.The stylus has a clip so that you can attach it to a shirt, briefcase pocket, etc. The clip holds the stylus securely, but also removes easily.At the time I posted this review, this stylus was selling at $15.99. There are some styluses out there that are less expensive, but those I have tried don't work quite as well, although they do work. For me, it is worth a little more to have a stylus with such an excellent response. I plan to buy a second one to keep as a spare in case I lose this one.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0054R1EY0" id="B0054R1EY0-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-08-02:</strong> 3M Smart Pen - Grey Clip-On Design - Precision Touch Pen for Mobile Handheld DevicesThis is my second stylus for my iPad that I've tried.

The 3M product is slightly thinner and shorter than the Acase. The tip is also a bit smaller. The barrel of the pen is very smooth; no texture on the 3M, the Acase is slightly rough. They have a similar price point but the Acase is less costly. That said the 3M Smart Pen is very nice, indeed. It is a fine tool as it feels nice in the hand and produces great results as you write on your tablet. The Acase has a removable tether that lets you secure it to the tablet's earphone jack. I've never used it and don't like the idea of a metal object dangling from my iPad. No great loss to me on the 3M.

His biggest gripe about most pens is he has to write rather large in order to get a legible result.  His other complaint is the stylus is often very short which makes it harder for him to write.For the past month or so my husband's stylus of choice has been one made by Targus.  It wasn't perfect, but he said it got the job done.  He was unimpressed by the lack of precision it offered as well as its length.When I selected this 3M Smart Pen and told him about it he was skeptical that it would be any good.  His reasoning was mostly snobbery.  He didn't see how a pen produced by 3M would be better than the Targus one.  I asked him to try it out anyway and tell me what he thought of it.Minutes later he was showing me an iPad with side by side comparisons of writing samples.  The 3M pen allowed him to write smaller.  The precision was better with this pen than with the Targus model.  He also found the pen to be more comfortable in his hand.  The 3M pen is about 1/2 an inch longer than the Targus stylus.  I didn't think that the difference in length made was that big of a deal, but for someone with larger hands, the difference is notable.Since testing out the 3M stylus, my husband has claimed it as his own.  The Targus one now sits in his bag as a back up in the event that something should happen to his new favorite.He's pleased with the 3M stylus and is not only surprised that 3M produced a better pen than Targus, he's also impressed by the $15 price.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0054R1EY0" id="B0054R1EY0-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-07-28:</strong> This light, attractive stylus works well.

It needed you to press fairly hard to register, and so made quick note taking and drawing a bit difficult. So was curious to try this 3M stylus and see how it compared. And yeah, it does much better! You can use a very light touch and still get good results. There's a slight nib inside so has a better, more natural feel for me as well.I didn't really like the metal finish though, I prefer a pen with a texture or grib, like the Acase has (no much, but at least more than the 3M does!) It's also a bit shorter than I like, and doesn't have the nib for attaching to the iPad headphone port which sometimes comes in handy. Better would be a clip that would actually work with the majority of cases, rather than this normal pen clip, I'm sure to lose the pen eventually since it has to be carried separate from my tablet.

I decided to get the 3M Smart Pen because I'm constantly misplacing my stylus around the house. In any event, here is what I decided:From the basic look the Targus Stylus seems a little more classy; solid black with a clip-on design, and a little (fake) push top button (that doesn't push) to make it look like a pen.  The 3M Smart Pen is a little longer (about a  inch), with clip-on design, it's also  sleek, but feels like a hollow silver tube.The rubber part of the tips of each pen is not the same.  The Targus Stylus is a bit more solid and padded.  The 3M Smart Pen feels really flimsy (this is the one thing I do not like about the 3M pen).I tested both pens on the iPad Whiteboard application.  Both pens write perfect, no problems with performance. The 3M Smart Pen even makes a little squeak as though you're really using a dry erase pen over a whiteboard!If you bought the 3M Smart Pen I'm sure you won't feel disappointed.  The pen works great.

On a whim, I decided to try it on my iPhone.  I was pleasantly surprised at how precise it is.  With my phone held in portrait mode, I was able to quickly type Abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz with no errors.  For comparison, I tried the same task using two thumbs, and also just using one index finger: Each time, I made one or more errors in my typing.  I found this 3M stylus to be highly responsive, reacting as expected to even the slightest touch to the display.I also own a BoxWave stylus.  If you are trying to decide between the two, here are some design aspects you might want to keep in mind:1. Perhaps most significant: The 3M seems more responsive than the BoxWave, with the 3M requiring a much lighter touch in order to type.2. The 3M stylus is roughly a half-inch longer, and ever-so-slightly thinner than the BoxWave.  That slight difference makes the 3M feel a little better for my fairly small hand.3. The 3M stylus feels a little too light in my hand, despite only being a couple grams lighter than the BoxWave.4. I prefer the "Jet Black" BoxWave's metallic finish to the brushed metal feel of the 3M.  There's just something slightly odd to the feel of the 3M. (Odd enough that it's the reason I've given this 4 stars rather than 5.)The final verdict: While minor differences such as length and the feel of the metal may depend on the user, the responsiveness of the 3M makes it a better choice than the BoxWave.  It has become my go-to stylus on both the iPhone and iPad.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0054R1EY0" id="B0054R1EY0-review30" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-08-17:</strong> This pen feels like any ordinary pen.

I use it on my iPad with Adobe Ideas and Penultimate, and it allows you to have that feather-touch I've been wanting for over a year. I can do do the lightest strokes on the screen, and it tracks VERY well.One thing to note: I don't use a protective clear skin on my iPad screen, so my experience with this stylus is on the screen directly.

If you do run bare like me, then I highly, highly recommend that you try this stylus.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0054R1EY0" id="B0054R1EY0-review33" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-07-28:</strong> I've tried some other capacitive styli in my time, and the edges are always odd - either some kind of sponge-like material, or the solution here which is a soft plastic "air bubble" at the end, about the diameter of 1/2 a large pea.I guess to each his own, but for me the air-bubble effect with thin plastic gives the impression that it could rupture or break quite easily, although this has not happened in the limited time that I have owned this.The clip at the end is a nice touch, but without the ability to retract or cover the tip, I'd fear damage again when clipped into a pocket.One last factor for the 4 stars is the price. When you hold this, it has some heft, but you get the distinct impression that it should be an under $10 item.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0054R1EY0" id="B0054R1EY0-review34" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-07-26:</strong> This 3M Smart Pen arrived at a perfect time, when my computer was in the shop, and I used my iTouch for internet access.  I've always had trouble typing on the iTouch with the little tiny letters where it's easy to press two "keys" at a time.  This stylus solved that problem and made it very easy to touch the letters I wanted and made the whole process much quicker.  It also worked well for scrolling.It's a pretty simple device with a silver metal case with a pocket clip (so you can look like a computer geek) and a soft tip that they describe as "anti-stiction".  It's not really rubber, I guess it's probably some type of soft plastic material and it's colored silver just like the pen which gives it a nice sleek look. It's kind of a "puffy tip" almost like soft foam underneath the domed cover which covers the hard tip. It's nicely weighted and feels good in my hand.  It's also great on the surface of my iTouch screen because it moves smoothly without sticking, dragging or skipping.  It actually feels like my fingertips in the way it reacts with the screen except that it doesn't leave fingerprints.  I also tried it on my Blackberry, not on the screen, but for typing on those little tiny keys.  It worked well with that too.  This is one of those devices that I wasn't sure that I needed, but if I lost it now, I'd buy a replacement.  It's a nice, well designed product.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0054R1EY0" id="B0054R1EY0-review35" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-07-27:</strong> I love this pen, in that:1.

Responsiveness is a bit better on the tablets, and I think this has to do with the slightly quicker reaction time of the latest round of capacitive touchscreen tech. It's perfectly acceptable on my Droid, too, with the response being maybe a tenth of a second slower than finger-touch. It makes a big difference for drawing/sketching and for those times when I want to take notes or write something down quickly and don't want to type it or try to hand-write it using my fingertip. It's basically like having a digital pocket notepad. Functionality is similar on a tablet, of course, and the 3M Smart Pen comes highly recommended to those who are looking to use an iPad or other tablet as a replacement for a steno pad or sketchpad.Why not five stars? Well, my only reservation is in the design. The writing end of the Smart Pen isn't tapered like pens, pencils, and styluses generally are, so the user has to get used to having a thicker writing end, and several of my friends who tried my Smart Pen expressed discomfort in using it because of this. Personally, it's not a deal-breaker for me- I'd prefer a tapered stylus-like writing end for precision's sake, but once I got used to the shape of the tip, it wasn't a big deal. Potential buyers should be aware of this, however. (For what it's worth, every 'tablet pen' I've seen has this same form factor, so it's obviously a function of how the pens need to be designed in order to work effectively with capacitive screens.)In short, this is a nice product that works as advertised. By the way, I've noticed some other reviewers complain about the weight of this product relative to other similar products, and I have to concur, it is a bit heavy by comparison, but I actually favor it for that reason- it feels sturdier and more comfortable to me. The extra weight is a plus in my opinion.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0054R1EY0" id="B0054R1EY0-review37" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-07-28:</strong> If you are looking for a true precision touch stylus, this 3M smart pen is the choice for you.

You know how sometimes you're trying to punch in one letter or number on a touchscreen keyboard and it enters another number instead? This stylus makes it much easier to type accurately, so that happens a lot less. And do you ever have a hard time clicking on things at the edges of the screen? This stylus is useful for that too, because it can squeeze into corners that are too tiny for fingers. So far I've used this stylus with an iPod Touch and an Android phone, and it worked well with both. It's not too big, doesn't take up much room in a purse, and has a clip to keep it secure in a pocket when it isn't in use. It's also reasonably price.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0054R1EY0" id="B0054R1EY0-review39" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-07-29:</strong> I like this stylus a lot better than theTen One Design Pogo Sketch Stylusthat I bought for my ithings.  The Pogo Sketch Stylus has a bit of plastic-like fibrous sponge on the end.  This stylus has a roundish bit of something soft and squishy.  I had some concern about scratching some of my screens with the Pogo Stylus.  The 3M Smart Pen makes me feel I can safely apply pressure to the screen.  MyViewSonic gTablet with a Multi-Touch LCD Screenhas a lock that requires dragging my finger in a pattern on the screen and I have a bit of trouble with doing this with the Smart Pen, but that is the only thing I have had difficulty doing using the Smart Pen.The Smart Pen is about the same length as the Pogo Stylus and thicker, which I like.  It feels more like a real pen, although I would probably like one that has a gel grip.  I looped a rubber band around the barrel to allow a better grip. Hopefully this will cut down on the number of fingerprints on my touch screens.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0054R1EY0" id="B0054R1EY0-review40" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-07-29:</strong> I've got an iPad and an iPhone and found this stylus to work well with both. Tapping, doodling (my son really enjoyed this feature) or very broad note taking is easily achievable with any program that accepts the touch input, including many free drawing and chalkboard apps. Now, if you're hoping to use this for note-taking and later convert to handwriting, a la the ancient Newton stylus, you're going to have more trouble. The tip is very broad and this is, at best, a preschool crayon writing solution, not a college student or doctor's note taking tool.Lightweight (no bigger/heavier than your average fountain pen) and inexpensive, this is great for occasional writing/drawing use on the iPad. A real boon for things like alphabet tracing games. My preschooler immediately picked up the pen and is now actually learning to WRITE the letters, instead of the finger trace, which frankly does very little educational good.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0054R1EY0" id="B0054R1EY0-review41" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-07-26:</strong> What's old is new again it seems.  Long ago (in technology age measures) I had touchscreen PDA's that used plastic stylus pens so I've been used to using a stylus for quite some time.  Heck, my usage of same probably predates the original PDAs having been involved in and working in the printing business and getting to play with the nice toys from that business back in the day...  Anyway, it seems that 3M is making the effort to sell their own stylus pen that can be used with all of the modern era devices and that isn't a bad thing at all.I suppose it's bad for touch typing and hence I could and did knock a little off the review rating, but in the end this is a nice tool that does the job it's designed to do.  It helps keep fingerprints off the screen and does offer precise control, it just does so via the plastic tip rather than the use of your own fingers.  Given how much I dislike getting my own fingerprints all over my Xoom's screen, or my iPad and iPhone screens, I think I'd love to use this stylus though I would note that I'm left trying to figure out the best place to carry the stylus since it is an add-on item and wasn't designed to be carried around directly with the devices like the stylus and PDA's of old.In anycase, the 3M Smart Pen works as designed and intended and really that's all I should ask.

The quality of the pen is solid and the feel of the round rubber tip that touches the screen is satisfactory.  The best thing is that I do not need to see my figerprints on the iPad any more (I have used a protect film from 3M for the iPad and have experienced a lot of fingerprints on it).

What a disappointment.  The earhook is so flimsy that it came apart in the first 10 minutes.  I had not opted to use the earbud only (don't trust those - always scared it will come out of my ear) - and although I tried two different size buds as well as the earhook, it was so loose that if I shook my head even slightly, it came out.  The call sound was average - nothing to write home about, but after 30 minutes of having to constantly keep pushing it back into my ear and reattach the ear hook, I took it off and returned it.  WASTE OF TIME.  I then bought the Plantronics Voyager Pro and have to say that for stability, it is rock solid- it stays on my ear very well, stays in place, and the sound is like no other bluetooth I have had - even when driving, it has loud, good, clear sound and people that I ask say they hear me very clearly and loudly.  The microphone is quite a bit longer than the other bluetooth headsets out there and it actually looks like a microphone - some people may think this is a bit old fashioned but I love it - it brings the mic closer to my mouth so when I speak, I sound MUCH better - This one is a KEEPER.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B002WN2JJ8" id="B002WN2JJ8-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-06-19:</strong> EXCELLENT PRODUCT.

Not only do you get two in great colors, but these are super absorbant and flexible. They fit on easy, with a tiny bit more "lip" around the edges to hold it in place than other covers. BUT, the buttons are all still accessible, including power.They don't slip off and the textured material keeps an easy grip and are easy to find around the house.  I feel confident that the case protects the phone if it drops.

The colors in this pack are a purple(almost cobalt blue) and a deep rose (not quite pink, not quite mauve).The cases fit well as Belkins tend to do, and they are made of a decent thickness silicone, so they do add some protection.  Like most textured silicone cases, they give you a nice grip of your phone. They are smooth enough to slide easily in/out of pockets.  The edge along the font is beveled so if you lay the phone face down, it doesn't touch the surface on which you've laid it.Everything on your phone remains functional when the case is on, although your Home button will be covered (but usable).They are a decent, inexpensive solution as fr as cases go, although being flexible silicone, there is a little play on the sides where the beveled edge meets the phone, so if you want a super snug fit textured silicone/rubber case for an iPhone 5, you might want to look toward a Speck PixelSkin or some other brand.The price is right, and they are a decent case, but it fit like most silicone cases, so if ultra-snug is what you are after, this isn't it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009APBYO2" id="B009APBYO2-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-25:</strong> Given the retail price, I was surprised by how nice these cases are. Yes, they don't offer the protection of the upper-end Belkin cases or the Otterbox series, but they are sold at a different price point. These protect the back, sides, home and lock buttons, and even a little of the screen with a rubberized rim in case the phone falls flat. Besides the price, the nicest part of these cases is how they allow the iPhone 5 to remain small while still protecting it. The rubber texture (silicone?) resists a bit when going in and out of my pocket but not so much to be annoying. And I really like that I can switch cases from purple to pink and back to purple, depending on my mood, without a lot of effort. Both look good on my black iPhone, although the pink pops more because of the contrast. The purple is more of a stealth color because it's so dark.The one small drawback (and it is minor, in my opinion) is that the silicone over the home button requires a little more pressure than if it were uncovered. That's the price, however, of protecting that button.These are fantastic budget cases. They look surprising good and give decent protection. Combine them with a screen protector if you are worried about the glass.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009APBYO2" id="B009APBYO2-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-30:</strong> I got these cases in the blue and violet colors.

Unfortunately, I cannot list many for the Belkin Flex Cases, so I'll list what I don't like about these cases first.1.  The color listed - blue and violet - should be renamed, purple and magenta.  There is not flaming way in Hades that this case is blue.  My husband took one look at the case and told me "I am not putting a purple cover on my iPhone, thank you".2.  The home button is effectively covered entirely by the case (see the comparison photo I uploaded next to a hard case by Belkin). This renders the button practically useless unless you like mashing the button super hard to get it to work.3.  This case is a major lint magnet.  I put this case in my hoodie pocket, my purse, my car...and it just seems to scream to lint "COME TO ME!".  Now either my pockets/purse/everything in my house are laden with filth (it's not) or this case just seems to attract everything and get stuck in those textured lines.4.  The case is super soft - this can be a plus or a minus.  If you drop the phone...not so useful.  If you like holding your phone - it does feel very nice.5.  It looks cheap.  Seriously.  This is a case is something I could see being sold at a dollar store.  It's really not impressive.All in all, I don't entirely hate this case - I've seen some pretty crappy cases out there, and this is definitely not the worse the bunch.  That said, at two star, I just don't like this case.  Even in a two pack, I'd rather spend the money on a decent hard case and call it a day.

It allows for a nice firm grip on your phone and a security feeling that you don't get from some of the ones that are more slippery.  They are well made and none of the buttons are covered up at all. Great deal.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009APBYO2" id="B009APBYO2-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-29:</strong> I love these cases, they are cute and they seem fairly sturdy.

I rarely feel so strongly about a product, but after having tried so many screen protectors over the years I was just blown away by the quality of this material.  Like everyone else says, it is simple to apply and there are no bubbles and no imperfections.  There's no messy application solution and no need to wait for it to set over night.  If you don't align it properly the first time, it won't be ruined when you take it off and reapply it.  It is amazing that there can be such a difference in quality between different brands of thin, clear plastic.  Whatever formula they use to create this just cannot be beat.  When I got the iPhone 5, I first tried the skinomi brand since it was inexpensive and had high marks in the amazon review section.  I was disappointed with it, so I got the moshi.  It is far more expensive, but completely worth it.  It was like getting a new phone all over again.  If I were an Apple executive, I would want to buy the Moshi company and ship every iOS device with one of these protectors.  Put the rest of the jokers out of business because they are just wasting everyone's time and money.Things to be aware of before purchasing:1) There are two versions of this protector.  The crystal-clear and the anti-glare.  There are trade-offs to be considered and this is not specific to Moshi protectors. Anti-glare is great for use outdoors when you are taking pics, but it creates a slight dulling effect on the screen when used indoors.  The crystal-clear version is a better experience most of the time, but it has that outdoors problem.  I have the anti-glare version and I don't mind the matte look when reading indoors.  If you don't like matte, then get the crystal-clear version.2) I'm writing this review a mere two months after the iPhone 5 came out, so I have an early version of this protector.  There is a cut-out for the front-facing camera that is incorrectly off to the left side of the speaker at the top of the screen.  It looks as though Moshi got bad prerelease info from Apple that the camera would be off to the side like it was on the 4/4S.  They apparently went back and enlarged the speaker cut-out to include the camera's actual location above the speaker.  I imagine that future versions of the protector will correct this problem after they run through the initial inventory.  The cut-out doesn't bother me enough to lower the rating to 4 stars.  This is still a phenomenal product.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009C9CG3E" id="B009C9CG3E-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-07:</strong> I got this for my wife to place on her Iphone.

We only sell them because they are over priced and help us reach our quota. These are the worst screen protectors I have ever used. It's great because you can put them on easier, unfortunately, they will not last long at all and the stickiness will start to get dull. They take away from the resolution of the phone, they don't fit with cases, and they say they are washable but they won't stick well at all after being washed. Get an invisible shield or a regular screen protector and have a friend or a local store that sells phones put them on for you.

That was the year I scratched my first screen with my car keys and was introduced to the world of screen protectors.  Since then, and many iPhones later, I have tried a myriad of screen protectors from cheap to expensive and I have to say this one, although on the spendy side, is worth every cent.  It's no-glare, which is nice, but doesn't make the display look &#34;fuzzy&#34; like some other no-glare screen protectors do.  My retina display is crystal clear.  It's resusable! This was an absolutely marvelous thing when my first iPhone 5 developed a technical glitch and had to be replaced.  I just pulled this off the old phone and put it straight on the new phone -- no fuss no muss.  It is so easy to install.  Don't get me wrong, you still need to clean the screen with a lint free cloth - a sticker sheet is provided so you can remove any stubborn dust specs and you still have to squeegee out the bubbles, but the screen protector is a pretty substantial sheet (maybe twice as thick or more than the cheapie protectors) so it holds it's shape and is easier to maneuver than the cheapies.  It also does a fair job of squeezing most bubbles out on it's own so it's just a matter of running a soft cloth over it a few times to get out the stragglers.  It's strong.  I had it on my phone for more than 6 months before I managed put a tiny scrape on it -- and I'm very hard on my phones.  Do not confuse this with the InvisibleShield product which takes a rocket scientist to install and has very limited durability (yes, I've had one of those, too).  The Moshi is very, very simple to install and doesn't take an advanced degree in bio-nuclear physics.I know you can buy a dozen cheap screen protectors for the same price as this... and if you don't mind the aggravation of swapping out your screen protector every few months, the air bubbles that always develop later, the dust specs trapped underneath, the peeling on the edges, and the places where your protector didn't line up perfectly with your home button or ear speaker, not to mention the time spent as you curse your way through installing 3 screen protectors before you get it right (and not even perfect, at that), then stick with the cheapies.  However, if avoiding stress and aggravation is important to you and your time has a modicum of value, then I give this product my highest recommendation.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009C9CG3E" id="B009C9CG3E-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-03:</strong> I have an iVisor for my Macbook Pro and I loved it so much I knew it would be one of the first accessories I bought for my iPhone. I love the screen protector and it definitely does what the packaging claims: the bubble-free installation is awesome because the adhesive part is around the bezel of the phone. The surface treatment does a very good job at reducing and smudges or smears; I always get compliments on my fingerprint-free screen. And last but not least, the fact that you can apply and reapply the screen protector over and over is awesome and was helpful when I has trouble lining it up the first time I installed it. And obviously, the anti-glare feature is exactly what I expected it to be after having experience with the iVisor on my computer - it's awesome, I prefer the matte look.I love the fact that the screen protector fulfills all of the claims made on the packaging/in the description, I know this is an expensive accessory but the fact that it does so much makes me feel like I made a good investment. I also haven't had any issues with it popping up because of one of my cases. The one negative thing I will say is the fact that this being a matte screen protector it will take away from the quality of the amazing retina display but that is something that I knew before buying this screen protector and it has been one of the only sacrifices I've had to make since installing the iVisor AG.EDIT: I've had the screen protector for a few months now and while I'm still in love with it I've started to notice some scratches. The screen protector is made of a slightly thick plastic so the scratches look deep although they are only noticeable when the screen is turned off. I am disappointed seeing as this is an expensive product but better the screen protector than the screen!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009C9CG3E" id="B009C9CG3E-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-03:</strong> I have the iVisor for my iPad and my Iphone 4 and I love it.

I used the Invisible Shield and Zagg before on my older phones. They work but I had them installed by the dealer. And if it comes off, you have to pay installation fee again and that cost you more. This product however is so easy to use. You can adjust and re-adjust and it still sticks. It has not come off since I put it on. The anti glare feature affects the clarity of the screen a little bit but the protection it provides for the screen is worth it.This is and excellent screen protector.

We recently hit the point in our almost-finished two-year AT&T; contract where we could upgrade phones, but I wasn't going to do it, at least for me; however, I really wanted to replace my wife's old Samsung Captivate SGH-i897 with the new Samsung Exhilarate SGH-i577 because, if you think about it, they're basically the same phone, only the Exhilarate has a faster (and dual-core) processor, more RAM (though less internal storage), a front-facing camera, and a bigger battery.  And it's 4G, too!  So, for long-time Captivate lovers (which my wife is) who lament the Captivate getting slower and slower with bigger apps needing more both processor cycles and RAM, and who also lament the Captivate having no front-facing camera for video calls, the Exhilarate is the logical step up!SEE:  [...]Plus, AT&T; is letting 'em go, as of this writing, for a lousy buck with a new two-year contract.  What's not to love, right?As it turned-out, I couldn't both upgrade her phone, and also move us over to the new AT&T; "shared data" plan (through which, by the way, we doubled our monthly data allowance, plus made absolutely everything else unlimited) at the same time on the website, so I called AT&T; and asked for a supervisor (always do that; and never let 'em talk you out of it, which they'll aggressively try to do).  She switched us over, but she couldn't sell us the Exhilarate for the $1 price (that was web-only) so I had to go back to the web to do that part.  While I was on the phone with her, though, I lamented that I couldn't upgrade from my Samsung Infuse 4G (SGH-i997) to a Samsung Note (SGH-i717), 'cause I just didn't want to spend the money yet. So she said that since she was a supervisor, she could deeply discount it... and next thing you know, we bought that, too.  While I had her on the phone, I also asked if, by chance, she could help us with an over-$250 overseas call made a couple month earlier, but only accidentally. It should have been on Google Voice, but my wife pressed the wrong button and it went onto AT&T.;  To my astonishment, she adjusted/credited our account by $195. I couldn't believe it!  Again, always, always, always ask for a supervisor.  But now I digress.  Sorry.So, while the Exhilarate was being shipped, I started to research getting a TPU skin/cover (or case, or whatever one wants to call it) for it.  TPU, for those of you who don't know, is superior to silicone.  TPU is a harder, rubberized material; and this particular one...[...]...which I got for my Infuse is, by far, the most popular one, now, on Amazon. A couple years ago, they were like ten bucks; but now they're anywhere from only a penny to all the way up to maybe $8. It is, hands-down, the best TPU thin-skin case out there.  Seriously.  Note that it covers the power button and volume rockers: All cases absolutely MUST cover those two electromechanical buttons/switches, and should not have cut-outs for them, else body oil and dust will cake-up inside said buttons/switches, and all of a sudden the phone won't turn on (or off); or wake-up the screen if on.  Many users think their phone's broken when that happens, but it's usually just a dirty-inside power button.  Making sure that the thin skin/case covers those two buttons/switches ensures that even after two or three years of hard use, the phone not only still looks good, but its insides are not dirty/oily.Anyway, so I wanted that particular TPU skin/case (only in white) for my wife's new Exhilarate.  However, I quickly learned that that big rounded bump on the Exhilarate's lower back cover (baby's got back!) is a challenge to mold TPU around.  Oh, it can be done, but it shoots the price of the TPU case way up too high for the market.  I spoke with a Chinese guy in New York at one of the TPU case makers, and he explained it to me. Bummer.  Interestingly, the T-Mobile version of the Exhilarate -- the Blaze 4G -- has no such bump on its lower back cover; and so there are TPU cases for it up the yingyang, out there!Anyway, so, then, I started trying to find something else.  Silicone (which is what the soft part of this Incipio case is made of) was out!  Silicone, most people don't realize, is what the really, really cheap and crappy cases are made of.  And what makes it bad is that it's too microscopically porous on its surface, and so is not shiny; and will stretch, over time.  Trust me, TPU is superior!  A good rule of thumb, usually, is to avoid silicone like the plague when it comes to these phone covers/cases/skins!So, at first, I ignored this Incipio case because the soft part of it is made of silicone.  But I couldn't find anything else!  Oh, sure, I found a few TPU cases, but with cut-outs for the power button and volume rockers.  I've already explained why that's unacceptable.So I eventually circled back to this Incipio case (the white-on-magenta version), and looked much, much closer at it.  There are actually two qualities of silicone out there: the super-cheap and crappy/stretchy quality of my previous mentioning, herein; and the far, far better quality such as that used in the Otterbox cases.  As I looked more closely at this Incipio's photos (which are larger on the Incipio website), I could see -- especially on the part which covers the buttons, and how well defined and molded they are -- that the quality of silicone used in this case is the better one.  Suddenly I was more interested in this case than I first thought.So I used the Incipio site's store locator and found a store near me that had one; and I drove over to see it.  Indeed, it's a superior quality silicone... one which won't stretch anywhere near as easily (though it's still not quite as good as TPU, no matter what).  I liked it, to my surprise.  Sadly, they didn't have one for the Exhilarate in stock (pretty much no one does, for some reason: it's a hard-to-buy-for phone)......so I came home, showed the photos of this white-on-magenta Incipio to my wife (she liked it... almost better, actually, because the two colors have more character, she said, than a pure white cover/skin) and bought it here, on Amazon.  As of this writing I haven't received it yet, but as you can see, here, it shows that I bought it.  I'm writing this based on my seeing one, and holding it in my hands, and fitting it on a phone, at the store.  I'll come back here, after she's used it a while, and report/update further.So, then, what we have, here, is a far more interesting product than I first thought.  I should not have been so quick to dismiss it simply because its soft parts are made of silicone instead of TPU.  It's basically like the Otterbox (at least one model thereof), but way more stylish.  It uses the same quality silicone as one of the Otterbox layers, and so it's really good stuff... the best kind of silicone one can get.  So while it could still stretch, it's considerably less likely that it'll happen; or at least it won't happen as easily.  Ideally, though (and, trust me, I've suggested this to all the makers of this kind of case), they should use TPU wherever they use silicone.  Or, better yet, they should use really thin silcone with the high-impact-absorbing internal cells against the phone (like the Otterbox), then really thin TPU on top of that, wrapping around to the glass ('cause that's where all the stretching and deformation happens, from fingers pulling on it when swiping), then the hard case fitted on top of that, similarly to how it's fitted onto this Incipio case.  Of course, then the cost of the case would be far higher, but I'm just sayin' that that's the ultimately best way.  The first of the Incipio-like manufacturers that  finally does it will, I predict, capture the stylish-alternative-to-the-Otterbox market!  But now I digress, again. Sorry... again.I still prefer the thin TPU skin of the type to which I earlier herein linked; and I got precisely that for my will-probably-arrive-in-a-day-or-two Galaxy Note (SGH-i717).SEE: [...]Plus, if anyone cares, through trial and error, I've learned that only the "Realook" brand screen protectors are any good... er... well... strike that: There are at least two other brands that are as good (but, seriously, not better), but they're far more expennsive than the Realook.  So we got those, too.  You MUST, trust me, have a screen protector; and the free ones that tend to come with cases just don't feed the bulldog.  Most of them, even if they're of the hard/crystal type plastic, are of such low quality plastic that they show that oil-on-water, multi-colored swirrely look at an angle, and they scratch like the dickens.  If you research the Realook, you'll see it's multi-layer design, and other benefits.  It really is superior.  The Realooks, while expensive, last seemingly forever.The trick is to not let any dust get under 'em (or fingerprints on the sticky side) when you install... er... that, and being super-patient... and willing to waste your first-ever one, as practice (they come two to a pack).  Hint:  Do it in the bathroom, after steaming-up the place (to make water stick to airborne dust particles and drop 'em to the floor), with super clean hands, after super-cleaning the phone, and super-cleaning whatever surface you do it on.  I have a table thingy that folds down from the wall above the toilet in one of the bathrooms (very boat galley-like), and so that's where I do mine.  Perfect every time (though it's, admittedly, a huge challenge)!  But there I go, digressing, again (just tryin' to make this posting information-packed).Anyway, then I got this Incipio white-on-magenta for my wife's Exhilarate because, well... frankly... because, as I earlier herein wrote, baby's got back, and so there's just nothing else -- at least nothing reasonble -- out there for the Exhilarate in white (or, in this case, white-on-magenta).  It cost literally more than 30 times what my Galaxy Note's TPU skin/case cost, but it'll be well worth it, I think.I'm still dubious about how well the silicone will actually hold-up, over time (again, they should have used TPU) around the edges of the glass, but I'm willing to give it a chance because I can now see that it's the best kind of silicone out there.  Plus, obviously, I kinda' don't have much choice.Again, though, I'll report further, back here, once she's used it for a month or so.Hope that helps!Gregg L.

What is important, as pointed out by other reviews, is that you must unplug the unit from the outlet, insert the battery to be charged, then plug it into the outlet. If the blue LED comes on, repeat the procedure. In my case, both the blue and red LED light comes on when charging, and turns to blue only when it finishes charging.

It's not a rapid charger, but you wouldn't want that, that reduces battery life. It's a normal charger PLUS a two-way USB port.Tip #1) The USB jack on top can provide power for devices or recieve power from devices! (Power the charger from the wall, OR from a computer USB port, NOT FROM BOTH at the same time. I think you could damage the charger or computer if you did that, but not really sure about that)Tip #2) The springs under the contacts get weak over time, allowing the battery to fall out. Just wedge a &#34;bread bag closure tab&#34; on top of the battery and the battery will stay in snugly : )</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008JRSTEU" id="B008JRSTEU-review28" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-07:</strong> Very reasonably priced...I am happy with this item...a bit slow to charge, but it does a great job...a little cheap on the construct, but get what you paid for...but overall am happy with this purchase</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008JRSTEU" id="B008JRSTEU-review29" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-18:</strong> Bright LED is red while charging and turns blue when charged...  seems like a good travel battery charger for my S3 spare.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008JRSTEU" id="B008JRSTEU-review30" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-02:</strong> This is an affordable charger, but it can over charge and ruin your battery.

Opened to find Yibo Yuan box.  Looks and feels as expected.  USB pass through charger works.  Have new battery being charged now, will report on quality of device as I use it.I have NO clue why people are giving this such a low rating because it does not charge the battery while in the phone... it has a USB port to charge!  What morons!  Also saying it does not fit the S3 battery... WRONG!  I've personally used this with stock battery, QCell 4200mah battery, and ZeroLemon 7000mah battery.  All work fine!  Ignore these junk and WRONG reviews!Update 5-6-13: Left my ZeroLemon 7000mAh Extended battery on this from 1:30PM - ~11:30PM, power cycled the power strip it was on (easier than unplugging and replugging charger) then it sat until ~6:45AM today.  Upon putting the new battery in the phone, shows 100% charge.  I've heard these charge slower than as if it were in the phone, so gave it extra time for good measure (told to charge for 12 hours for initial charge of battery).  Now I have my "old" QCell 4200mAh battery being charged while I'm on my ZeroLemon.  Might be "slow" charge, but so far works like a champ!  Up to perfect 5 stars until I can find a flaw/defect/etc**Can get this much cheaper on eBay**</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008JRSTEU" id="B008JRSTEU-review35" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-29:</strong> It's always good to have an extra battery charged for the day.

Having a second battery in the external charger would allow me to switch batteries after 5 or 6 hours.I contacted this seller asking whether the USB would work in this capacity and got a "Chinglish" answer I could not understand. Anyway, I "took a chance" and bought a USB to USB cable, also here in Amazon and was pleased to find the Charger could indeed be used in my car.I bought this same charger from another seller with 3 batteries for $15. That proved to be a waste of money because the other batteries are practically worthless. They last maybe 3.5 hours with use but the charger does take appriximately 6 hours to charge, so there you have it. I contacted the seller complaining but they have yet to respond. I plan to return the item.My recommendation, buy two of these chargers, and 1 extra Samsung battery, which I found on Amazon for $10, and buy the USB to USB cable for $4.Keep a spare battery in a charger at all times. Change out the batteries each morning, or as needed later in the day.If you are driving somewhere, take the spare battery to the second charger in the car to keep it charged and switch out as needed.Links to products mentioned:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0089VO7OM/ref=gno_cart_title_2http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I9B2AU/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i01http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009137OEM/ref=oh_details_o06_s00_i00After using the product for 3 months, I am upping my review and now recommend it highly.

I would always order more than one so that if one does not work, you have a backup. I will be contacting the seller to see what they say about the one that arrived not working. I would also like to note that the shipping was much faster than the anticipated 30 to 45 days. This was shipped via overnight air from China to the US so overall shipping was less than one week.I entered a product return request for the one dead charger.

Mesh Stylus Father's Day Gift Set - Extreme-Durable Pro Series, 1 Black & 1 Silver Stylus in Chrome Gift BoxFinally, I found a good explanation on why a stylus loses its smooth writing ability and becomes less responsive.  The rubber tip eventually loses its capacitive coating and starts to drag.  One reviewer recommended dipping the stylus in talcum powder but this is NOT a solution.  The ultra-inexpensive styli seem to wear out very quickly.  On average, I paid about 30 cents for each of my last 40 styli.  I'm satisfied with the product at that price, BUT they did detract from the experience.I decided to test three models with mesh tips.  These ranged from $3.25 to $5.50 each.  WHAT A DIFFERENCE! These are all so SMOOTH, requiring less pressure, and drawing a very reliable line.  I can't yet comment on their durability, but I expect it will be worth the extra money.  I'll update the review if durability is exceptionally short or long.Which is the best? I like the 2nd one, the New Trent with the ball-point pen. Currently, you can enter a BOGO code which drives the cost down to $4.50 each. The stylus is no bigger than the others and the pen tip easily extends and retracts with a simple twist.**************************************************************************************************************** UPDATE 9/7/13 BOGO CODE NO LONGER WORKS. IT'S STILL WORTH $8.95, BUT THE OTHER TWO REPRESENT BETTER DEALS. ****************************************************************************************************************The other two are also good choices. The $5.50 one has a retractable tip which would be handy if the stylus bounces around with other things in pockets, purses, and such.  The $3.25 one is perfectly functional at the most attractive price.All-in-all, I can't imagine going back to the cheap stylus. Any of these three seems an excellent choice. Right now, they seem to be bargain priced. It is tempting to stock up a bit, but I worry I risk becoming a hoarder if I can't rest with six excellent styli and a few dozen disposables.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-01:</strong> A compact stylus that works smoothly ...a lot smoother than my finger tip ever could.

Bought mainly for a Nexus 7 with a screen protector on. Works well with it, better than my fingers on the virtual keyboard. Have also tried it on a Droid 2 Global (& Droid X) phone and an iPad2 (with screen protectors) with no problems ...and generally easier than using one's fingers.

The pen itself looks sophisticated and I found it better when having to select smaller, on-screen buttons that my fingers were probably just to fat for. The wider more ergonomic and sturdy feel, gives it the feel and look of an expensive pen as opposed to cheap long plastic ones. At the end of the day it still becomes a pen that I forget at my desk. Maybe I should put find a way to stick it to the back of my case in order to not forget it.

Each package gets you not one but two styli. One white and one black, other than color, they are identical.The stylus for touch screen has a soft flexible mesh metal tip. All my phones and tables have screen protectors. I was concerned the stylus might be sticky on the screen protector. I was pleasantly surprised: it feels very smooth and fluid. However, I do need exert a little more pressure compared with just using my finger when I use it on iPhone and iPad. However, I didn't need to do so when I use it with my Kindle Fire HDX (with a Zagg screen protector) as well. So it may be my an issue with i-devices combined with screen protectors. But the difference is de minimis.To use the stylus you need click the top to push the mesh tip out. Afterwards you can click the top again to hide the tip. This design provides protection to the soft mesh tip - a smart one I would say. It also has a clip for you to use on your breast pocket, geek style. Just kidding.It works well for both typing and text selection. The benefits of using a stylus are two-fold: no worries about leaving finger prints all over the screen; it is more precise, especially if you have fat fingers.The length of this device is about 10CM. For a person with average hand size, it is just long enough. But if you have a big hand (big hand usually is associated with fatter fingers, it may be an important reason to use a stylus), you may need one that is longer, say 15CMM. This is the only potential shortcoming I can see for some big guys. Otherwise, I like it very much. I give it a 5-star rating.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-09-06:</strong> A stylus is a stylus is a stylus right?What I've found is a stylus is as personal as a favorite flavor. Yes you can make do with something but it sure is nice to have your favorite flavor. I found a favorite flavor with this product.It's the usual shorter, thinner and lighter than a ball point pen . I have a couple of full length stylus pens and they feel long and unbalanced. I prefer the compactness of many of the stylus pens that many feel are too short because they aren't the same length as a ballpoint pen.If you write or draw using the tip of your pencil or pen, this one isn't for you for long time usage. It is not, evidently, designed for those who use the very end and can get uncomfortable very quickly.I like the balance point being far back from the end and the pocket clip helps it balance for me just right about half way back.If you don't want a solid feeling and sounding clicker when you retract the tip, try another one because this one is solid and can be loud. I like the solid thunk but others may find it annoying.If you don't want the hassle of a tight fitting pocket clip, this is not the one you want. It is tight and takes quite a bit of effort to clip it onto your pocket or tablet cover loop. I like this because I know it's attached when I'm done.I like the retractable tip, though it took some getting used to to remember to open our close it when that was never an option before.If you feel you need to spend big bucks to get quality, try another higher priced model. At 2 of them for under $11 total, including shipping, you can get extras so that when they inevitably "walk away" while you're on break you won't have to go back tip that old rubber skippy high priced one that nobody will "borrow" in your absence.If you want a stylus pen that is tough as nails yet inexpensive enough to find out just how tough it is give this one a try.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-14:</strong> At first, I was afraid that the stylus, being knit, would scratch my phone screen, but it didn't.

In meetings I prefer to use a note taking app (Note Anytime), as opposed to a pen and paper pad.  I like have the notes on my devices with me wherever and not have to worry about carrying additional notepads.  About this product... Pros:  IT has a click pen tip which will allow the stylus end to retract into the pen.  It has a clip which allows it to sit in the sleeve of my tablet without falling out.  It has a rubberized grip at the end that works much like a pencil grip for students to aid in better writing.  The best feature of the product is undoubtedly the stylus tip.  Most stylus have a rubber tip that is very inaccurate in writing.  However, this stylus tip is contoured with ridges in such a way that it actually provides small resistance against the tablet screen, giving the feeling of actually writing with a pen on paper.  This is leaps and bounds above my old stylus.  Cons:  The click pen mechanism is not extremely sturdy.  My daughter was able to disassemble it in no time flat, the spring never to be found again.  This is definitely not meant for little ones.

Their CS also deserves 1 star as I attempted to resolve the issue directly with the merchant and they refused to send me a new set.I would stick with the conventional rubber tip because these hybrids are not meant to last.

This definitely keeps it protected while it&#8217;s thrown in my bag, and things won&#8217;t get caught on the tip or wear it down unnecessarily while I&#8217;m not even using it.The tip of the stylus also has a clear plastic sleeve/cap that prevents the stylus body from scratching or contacting the touchscreen.So far I&#8217;ve used it with my iPhone as well as my MacBook&#8217;s trackpad.

I started with a rubber tipped boxwave stylus, which quickly wore out and began to have a bad writing flow, as it would stick to the screen. I switched to a boxwave stylus with fibermesh fabric, as it claimed that it was the newest technology out there. The price was a little high for my liking, but I ended up getting it anyway. About a week ago it started losing sensitivity on the screen, and I would have to push down so hard that the metal pen would hit the screen. Definitely frustrating. I wanted to try something similar, and came upon some great reviews for the New Trent Arcadia 2 pcs Clickpen Styli. To get two styli for that price was a no brainer. I have used it in class for about a week now, and have loved the feel and sensitivity. I wish that the end was a little more stiff to make it have more of a pen feel when writing, but overall it is the best I have tried so far. The clickpen feature is great for longevity, as it keeps the tip protected when it is in my book bag. Overall, it was a great purchase so far!

It glides across my iPad' screen very easily, and feels nice.- Retractable tip/clickpen design: This would be my second favorite feature of this stylus.  I like how the tip is protected when not in use.  I haven't used it for very long, but I can see how this one just might outlast my elago, because I can't mess up the rubber tip when I throw it in a bag or somethingWhat's meh about this stylus:- Feel/material:  This stylus definitely feels cheaper than my elago, even my old Boxwave.  Feels nicer than my old Pogo though, which was one of the first ones made for the 1st gen iPads.  It doesn't feel like a piece of crap or anything, just doesn't feel AS nice.- Pen clip thing: it's a nice-to-have in my case, but that's about it.- Size/length:  I have medium-sized hands, I think, so these are still a good size for me, but leans toward being on the smaller spectrum, IMO.What I don't like about this stylus:- Firmness of Rubber-tip: I'm still not a big fan of rubber tips in general, because they tend to be fat, squishy, not as sensitive, wear-out, and are not precise.  I'm not so worried out about the tip wearing out with this particular stylus, but it's still pretty soft, and it was not as sensitive as the elago that I bought with it, nor as precise.I don't know if I would necessarily return it though, as I guess I could keep them as back-ups in case something happens to my elago...but for now, these will not be my primary stylus.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review41" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-08:</strong> I bought this to use with my Samsung Note 3.

After doing some research, and looking at all the options, such as size and portability, that this stylus seemed to fit my needs, and I was right.The IMP63B is smaller than most pens, making it perfect for travelling, and the mesh ball provides me the perfect level of accuracy as well as not blocking the screen from my view.  While I did find that it took some getting used to for drawing (i.e. Draw Something), I have gained the ability to draw much more accurately than before, and as I have no skills at drawing, this has at least allowed me to give some idea of what I am drawing to whomever I am playing with.You will find me carrying my IMP63B as I travel for work, riding public transportation here in Chicago, or just sitting at home relaxing.

The New Trent stylus is the best one that I have used.Most styluses have a rubber tip that breaks.  The micro knit tip on the New Trent is great.  It does not leave any marks and is udrale.It is very easy to use on my iPad and iPhone.  Drawing is easy using this stylus.  Also, I like the precision that I get when I use it on my iPhone in particular. I can type, draw, or use applications quicker and more easily with the stylus.The twist pen is a good feature if you are carrying the stylus.  It eliminates the need to carry both a pen and a stylus.I like the gloss black finish.  It seems durable.  It looks and feels like a quality product.If you have an iPhone or an iPad, definitely get the New Trent IMP63B Stylus.

So far it has held up to a lot of use and it writes smoothly. I have tried rubber tips and I find they drag which makes writing hard. They also eventually tear and then you need to buy a new pen. I also have tried the expensive ones with the plastic round tip thingy. The main issue with those is that they click when you touch the screen. You think it won't bother you, but it is really annoying. These are quiet and smooth. The construction on these is a little poor. Sometimes they get stuck in place and other times you find the mesh doesn't protrude far enough. You can yank and pull on them into the right place, but it does take a little fiddling.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review70" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-30:</strong> I have tried many different styluses for my Apple devices. Originally, had bought one for $15 at Best Buy, which also doubles as a pen. The quality was great, but the price is a little high considering it is just a pen with a rubber tip on the other side. Since then I have tried many other &#8220;economy&#8221; styluses, but they always seemed unresponsive. You would have to press significantly harder to get a response from my iPhone or iPad.New Trent is a company that has proven to me that their devices are well made and priced fairly. So once I saw that they had a 2-pack for about $10, I decided to take the plunge.The stylus itself feels pretty well made. I love the fact that they are retractable. It keeps the knitted tip from getting frayed or dirty while not in use. It&#8217;s response is better than many other &#8220;economy&#8221; styluses I have tried. A knitted top versus a rubber one may seem a little strange at first, but after some use I can see why they went with it. You do not get that rubbery noise when moving the stylus across the screen and It moves quite smoothly. That in itself makes this a great purchase.My only gripe with it is that I wish it were also a pen. While not necessarily a deal breaker, it&#8217;s a convenient feature.If you&#8217;re in the market for a relatively inexpensive stylus, definitely give this one a try. It&#8217;s a tremendous value at $5 per stylus.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review71" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-07-05:</strong> I have tried several other stylus products, including the Pogo Sketch stylus.  So far, the New Trent Micro-Knit is the best stylus I've tried.  The Micro-Knit tip glides well over the screen and doesn't seem to scratch the screen.  It works better with screen protectors than other stylus products I've tried.  Having a metal clip is nice, as I've permanently damaged plastic clips on other styli - the metal clip could be a little easier to open and be a little wider, as you might often find yourself clipping the pen to the inside of a screen cover or similar thicker surface.  I'd also like to see an alternative method offered for clipping the pen - magnets, thin lanyard?  I'm not sure what the lanyard could attach to...I like the design of the pen - I have small hands, and don't mind the short barrel.  The pen itself is thick enough that it sits comfortably in my hand.  I use note-taking applications that offer palm protection, so resting my palm against the screen isn't an issue for me.  In those few times I have to hover my hand over the screen, the pen is smooth and comfortable.  I'd prefer the tip to be stiffer or offer more resistance against the screen, but as it is it's more accurate than other styli I've tried and enjoyable to use.I like the fact that the tip is retractible.  I didn't understand why there is a small piece of plastic surrounding the barrel of the pen, until I accidentally tried using the stylus when the tip was retracted - I gritted my teeth as I expected to scratch my screen, and instead saw the plastic ring protected the screen!  Thank goodness someone thought ahead and anticipated my dumb mistake...Overall, I'm very happy, and this is the best stylus I've tried so far.  In summary-Things I like:Micro-knit tip glides well on the screen, accurateWeight, balance and size all fit my smaller hands very wellRetractable tip protects tip, plastic casing protects screen if tip is retractedMetal clip more substantial than plastic clips usually found on styliThings I would change:Metal clip should be bigger to allow clipping to thicker surfacesTip could be stifferI'd like to have the option for magnets or a lanyard as an alternative for storing the stylus.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review72" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-06-28:</strong> I have used several types of stylus.  If you're looking for one to write with, this one is the best.  It's soft head makes it much smoother and easier than any other I've used.  The design is makes it very comfortable.  The push button to hide the end is very nice to prevent damage.  Depending on your hand size, you may wish it were a little bigger.I've bought cheaper ones before and almost ended up scratching my screen.  The end would push in too far or fall off.  The soft end prevens that and the hard end of the stylus is protected by soft rubber so if you forget to press the button and extend the end you won't damage anything.Overall an excellent product.  Definately recommend.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review73" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-07:</strong> I left on the small plastic guard on the tip area for supporting the sides and preventing the soft rubber under the metallic thread from collapsing so much.

The smaller tip is useful on the small screen of my iPhone4 and iPhone4s. It also works on my touch screen GPS.The tip is maybe half the size of the New Trent IMP62B Limir Stylus which I love because it also has an ink pen in it, and it offers many of the things I really liked with the Limir. The Micro-knit tip glides smoothly over the screen with no skips or stutters and it doesn't mush down as much as the standard rubber tip so it works better for drawing or writing on the touch screen.Since the tip retracts into the pen it is less likely to get bungled up or dirty.  The stylus has a metal body and the clip is strong. The build quality is good and the stylus click mechanism seems solid. The top part of the pen that you use to click the stylus in and out could be a little shorter as it seems to stick out a little more than necessary, but it might have to be that long to extend the stylus tip, not sure.The package came with a black pen and a white one which is nice.It's a good stylus for the money and I would have no problem recommending it to friends.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review75" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-14:</strong> I like this stylist, with a few reservations.

It glides much more smoothly than ALL of the rubber tipped ones I have used. However, the pocket clips break far too easily. The first one came off within the first few hours. The second one still has the clip in place but that's because I won't clip it on anything. Kinda wasted. But, a super stylus anyway.

What I don't like is, these seem to have excess tip on them and when I use it is smooshes down and kind of folds over. Also the clicker on these is very weak so when using it not only is the tip smooshing but its retracting back into the barrel. I removed the little plastic rings around the tip as well because when it would retract then the plastic edges would scrape against the touch screen and left slight/fine indent/scratches in the screen cover.

Let's just say I'm glad there are two in this pack otherwise I'd have nothing to give her. The IMP63T is slightly shorter than a normal pen but is big enough that you can hold it with ease.

The screen says cleaner, you have more granular control - especially with smart phones and smaller pad-type devices, and if you are drawing or signing, the stylus gives me a better feel since it's just like using a pen or pencil. For those reasons I always like to have a stylus or two near my gear.As a user of other New Trent products, when I spotted the stylus offerings, I thought I would give them a try. It was a pleasant surprise compared to my older rubber tipped units. I use multiple smart phones with and without protective screens, an iPad, Kindle, Windows 8.1 laptop with touch screen, and a few no name touch screen devices. Here are my findings:Pros:1. Good construction. similar in size to other styli. Fits in my hand as expected that a small sized stylus would. This is NOT a full pen sized stylus. It's smaller like many styli you can purchase.2. Micro-fiber tip retracts into stylus to protect it. No more having to wipe lint off the tip, or throw one out because you trashed it in your pocket or purse.3. Clear plastic ring on tip of unit. Originally I wasn't sure if it was a shipping component or integral part, and I've hear it's there to protect some equipment from being scratched by the metal ring attached to the barrel underneath it. I left mine on, as it doesn't interfere with my equipment (read some of the review questions for more information on this)4. This &#34;pro&#34; should probably be listed as the #1 item on this list - the microfiber tip kicks butt! I've used a lot of different styli before and I've had mixed results. Some don't work at all (but look great), some don't glide on the screen well, others just don't detect when you are applying pressure.Here's an example. I use a pattern based password on my phone. I as move my finger across multiple dots on the screen, a line or pattern is created that ultimately unlocks the phone. With many rubber tipped units, I can't draw the line. The phone senses contact, but does  not sense enough pressure to create a contiguous line.  With the New Trent stylus, the phone senses pressure the entire time I press on the screen, and I'm able to draw the pattern properly.  If you are a veteran stylus user, this should make sense to you. If you're a &#34;newbie&#34; - I hope my example makes sense!Cons:1. The Stylus is small.  While I list in the pro column that the fit in my hand is good, it is NOT a full pen sized stylus. Small styli are popular for that reason.2. The plastic ring around the Stylus near the microfiber tip is not documented well in the description. I left mine on although I don't believe it is necessary to do so.Thanks about it.  I hope my comments help.  FYI - New Trent also makes a combo stylus-pen unit which I also purchased. I'll comment on it later as well.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review86" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-20:</strong> I may give it five stars later on since I just got these a few days ago, but thus far, they are small enough (which I like) to fit into ones pocket (Shirt or pants) without any discomfort.

The ability to push the top like a pin to expose the tip when needed is great. However sometimes the tip can get stuck by pressing too hard.

Despite the prices, I found the performance to be pretty much the same with all others I have tried and the price difference really just got you a nicer looking piece.The problem with the standard, rubber-tip styluses is that they tend to stick as you are writing.  This makes it quite difficult to do anything (such as taking notes or drawing) with accuracy and at a reasonable speed.  I tried a number of tricks I have read for putting things on the stylus tip to make writing more smooth (tip: I found that a quick itch on the side of your nose works best) but everything I tried still wore off quickly or left marks on the screen.The main reason why this stylus is the first one I have purchased that I *really* like is the micro-knit tip.  The tip is still about a quarter of an inch thick (about the same as most rubber-tip styluses) so it really doesn't result in finer or more accurate lines but the material used is what makes all the difference.  The tip is still rubbery-feeling but is covered with a cloth-like material that makes writing very smooth and even cleans finger prints off the screen as you write.Along with the material used for the tip, I also really like the design of the stylus.  The retractable tip is a nice way to protect the micro-knit tip and the clip is nice for keeping track of it in my backpack.  As far as the size, I have tried others that are very small (had to pinch to write), heavy and fat (size of a big crayola marker), and longer (length of a pencil) but this stylus, in my opinion, is the perfect size- about 4" (10cm) (minus the tip and button).  The material is nice too- I believe it is aluminum so it is sturdy yet light.Bonus: This is a 2-pack of styluses.  After using this stylus I would pay the same price for a single one so getting two at this price is a great purchase.Btw, I tried this stylus out on my iPad, a Dell Streak 7, and an ASUS Transformer and it worked great on all of them.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review95" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-14:</strong> I only used one of these until I couldn't find mine and used a rubber tipped one that my hubby had handy.

I find that working with a stylus is much more productive. I have tried other prducts but like this one.  The tip is a fine mesh that is much more responsive than the other stylus with the rubber tip.  It took a little getting used to with finding the correct pressure to make it work smoothly. I love the fact that it's retractable. The size is right for me but for someone with bigger hands it might be a bit petite.  I like to clip my pens, etc. onto my work papers. The pen clip is very tight and does not slip onto the papers. I have several New Trent products.  I love there power packs.  They ship on time and customer service is very helpful.

It glides and is more precise. I can buy the regular stylus' at Rite Aid for $1.00 in every color in the rainbow with a clip. Actually I get it for 0.80 cents because when you spend so much you earn 20% off. (that's why I like that store... its on EVERYTHING and does not end) But they don't carry this nor would they price it for $1! It is rather expensive but you get two and with the more expensive tablets (IPAD) and phones (GALAXY and IPHONES) they work better than on a kindle and a $150 smartphone. For these, I prefer a slim rubber tip. This seems to be the general consensus in my family... hope this helps.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review98" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-06-16:</strong> I purchased a white touch screen stylus from New Trent not long ago... and my nephew liked it so much that I gave it to him and got another, this one in black.  This has all the basics you need in a stylus, with some nice extras.  Having the tip retract is nice so it stays clean, and the plastic around the tip avoids scratching anything if you push too hard or try and use it without the stylus tip extended.  I've used this on my iPhone and iPad, and it works great on both...

I used this at my desk, on my bed, and when I was out. While I would still use my fingers for day to day stuff, I really like using the stylus to draw, and especially like it when using a "swipe" style keyboard. Currently I am using Swiftkey Flow keyboard, which lets you basically tap a letter, and drag to the other letters in a word and it will predict the right word usually. The awesome thing with flow is that it lets you swipe through the space, so i can type complete sentences without lifting my finger-- and in this case, my stylus, which makes me even more accurate.  This makes messaging, searching, writing notes, etc. a lot easier for me. I really enjoyed using it on my phone.The only very minor issue I had was that something I would hit the side of the stylus on the screen instead of the micro-knit tip (when I'm lying sidewasy in bed) and it won't register. But this is a very small issue and only happens rarely.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review104" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-08:</strong> I really enjoy using the NT63T stylus.

If the tip could be a little more like a pen tip and still be conductive then I would definitely give it a 5.  Another option that might take it over the top is if New Trent found a way to make it a dual-purpose stylus.

I have used them with my iPhone 5c and iPad Air during the testing process. The stylus arrived with no other packaging other than a plastic sleeve with a New Trent sticker. The stylus themselves feel solid & sturdy. They are a bit short for a person with larger hands, but I find them a quality build. They have a metal clip to aid in attaching them to a tablet case, bag or whatever you are using to transport your electronics. The tip of the stylus is a mesh material that is soft to the touch. I find that I am not concerned with the mesh damaging the screen in any way. However, because the mesh is soft, I find myself needing to press down harder with the stylus than my natural inclination. Because of this, I do worry that I may damage the screen with the outer body of the stylus.I find the accuracy of the stylus to be hit or miss. I believe this is because of the soft nature. I need to press what I'm attempting to select more than once before I've pressed hard enough for the ipad to detect which in turn can become a damage problem if, when pressing hard, the outer stylus casing makes contact with the screen.Over all, I find that this stylus would be useful for those in a profession where written note taking or calculations are necessary. Those working in medical offices who carry ipads in & out of patient rooms would be a great fit. Contractors, handy men, those businesses needing to create estimates & work calculations on site would be a great fit. In addition, anyone who needs to collect customer signatures electronically would be a great fit for this product. Also, artists who chose to work electronically would benefit from the ability to freehand with this stylus.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review110" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-09:</strong> I received the stylus in a small envelope, the packaging was minimal but adequate.The stylus come in a little transparent bag, with 2 separate pockets and the New Trent logo.[...]Taking the Stylus out of the case is a breeze.

In the past I've used the hard pen-like tip ones and haven't had great experience with them. They just never seemed to be that responsive, and I would need to check that my device was taking the input correctly after every word. I'm pleased to say that this stylus is completely different than from those previous ones, since it has a unique soft mesh tip in the shape of a ball. This may take some time to get used to, since it is larger than a small pen-like tip and also soft so the amount of pressure applied makes a difference.Positive Qualities:-It works for general uses very well on the Nexus 7 tablet and even Samsung Galaxy S3 cell.-Well-constructed, based on looks it can compete with the best.-This price for two stylus pens is much better than for one lesser quality stylus from other companies (like Targus).-Accurate for writing on tablets. I use an app called Pen Supremacy (similar to One Note), and it worked well, though I don't know how often I would do this practically.-The length is ideal for a stylus, and many others are too long.Areas for Improvement:-Since the mesh is rather large, and it is a little difficult to use on very small screens. This became a problem for me when using an app to remotely access my laptop from my Nexus 7 (a 15 inch screen is shrunk down to 7 inches).-Unclear how the black/white finish will hold up with rough use or whether it will scratch easily.-The soft mesh is not as durable as hard plastic (like other stylus tips). I will update the review if the mesh rips.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review113" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-31:</strong> I refuse to use any other stylus now.

Single taps, double taps, flicks, scrolling are all recognized by the devices without issues.I keep stylus either in my shirt pocket or attached to the loop on the tablet cover.

You shouldn't expect to get the same kind of function as the S pen in a Samsung Galaxy Note because the S pen is integrated with a Wacom digitizer.  Most smartphones and tables only have capacitive touch.  So, the best you can do is get a stylus that will replace your finger.This particular stylus uses a microfiber tip, which I feel interfaces with the glass on touchcreens better than plastic or even rubber.  It's also very durable.  The only thing that keeps it from being 5 stars is the length.

The retractable point on the Trent Stylus allows me to keep it in my backpack, messenger bag or briefcase and never have to worry about it falling apart or getting dirty . I also loved the fact that I got two for the same price that I would pay for one at other retailers.

The stylus is very nice. The clip is tight and sturdy and the push button for the stylus tip has good tension on it. It fits nice in my hand and works very well with my Nook HD and my wife's Kindle fire. I like how you don't have to apply a lot of pressure for the stylus to work. The point of the stylus is thin enough that when you are using it it doesn't hit other letters or items. I did notice that the stylus took a little more effort to use with both cells phones. Plus it kept wanting to select other items that I didn't want selected. However I haven't really found a stylus that works perfect with the cell phones.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review127" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-24:</strong> I use these stylus pens with my iPhone 5 and iPad Mini. I have never really had much interest in using a stylus, personally, but I recently purchased a kitchen stand for my wife to use with her iPad Mini, and a stylus seemed like a perfect accompaniment to use for browsing recipes on the iPad while trying to cook with wet and/or messy hands. My wife was thrilled. From what she has told me, the stylus worked great and very functionally. She enjoyed the feel of the soft-tipped end, and appreciated the fact that the tip was retractable, as she believes this will protect the tip during storage and prolong the life of the stylus. The only slight drawback that she mentioned was that she felt like she had to apply a bit more pressure with the stylus than she normally would with her finger, which is probably the result of the soft-tip end compacting as it makes contact with the screen. From her perspective this was not a big deal, and she still found the benefits of using this in the kitchen to far outweigh this particular issue.I, too, noticed the need to apply an extra bit of pressure while testing with my iPhone 5. But again, it was only slightly more than with my finger, and not so uncomfortable that I would hesitate to use it because of that issue. The only other thing I would like to comment on is the use of the stylus to press the &#34;home&#34; button on these iOS devices. Both devices are housed in rugged cases, but while the iPad Mini's home button is covered by the rubberized material that makes up the cases outer shell, the iPhone 5's home button is covered by a thin plastic film. Using the stylus to press the home button on the iPad Mini (while in the case) was much more comfortable than trying to use the stylus to press the home button through the plastic covering on the home button of the iPhone 5. To be fair, this wouldn't be an issue for someone who is going to use the stylus without cases, or while staying primarily within one application. But, I could see this becoming a nuisance to someone who is trying to use the stylus while multitasking frequently between multiple apps on an iPhone in this kind of case. Although, for what it's worth, I imagine the stylus would be used with an iPad much more often than with an iPhone, and as I mentioned the stylus appears to work nicely with the rubberized covering on the iPad Mini's home button.I would recommend this stylus to anyone looking for a high-quality, easy to use stylus with the convenience of a retractable tip.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review128" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-04:</strong> I've been really happy with some of the stuff I've bought from NewTrent (I have a couple portable battery packs from them too) and these styluses are great too.

I can be as hard on my screen without worrying about scratching or cracking the screen. The one gripe I have with these are the protective plastic tips.

Typing an email or playing some osu!droid isn't a problem with these at all!

With this one, I've finally found it, and for a very reasonable price. I've been using one of these for a couple months. Aside from a couple small quibbles, it has performed admirably, and made me very pleased in the small investment. Along with the Notability App for iPad, it's a great solution instead of pen and paper.Pros:- It works. The metal knit holds its shape and doesn't deform when writing, and it lets me make even small moves to touch up a drawing or word that I missed.- The knit retracts so I don't worry about damaging it by throwing it into my bag. Other styluses I've used had a rubber tip that could easily get damaged.- It's lightweight just like a pen, without some ridiculous coatings or anything else. It's very basic, but priced well and works.Cons:- They are rather short. About 2/3 the length of a standard ballpoint pen. I have smaller hands, so it isn't an issue for me, but I imagine people with big mitts would be uncomfortable using this.- The clip broke off easily when my son pulled on it. For the low price, I can overlook this. They're essentially a small step above disposable.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review131" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-02:</strong> I've had this for a long time now and it still works just as good as it did the day I got it.

They seem very high quality.  The body and clip are made of metal, and the stylus gives off a good &#34;click&#34; when you're putting it out or in.  The springs seems to work well, and I'm guessing the styluses will hold up for a long time.I'm an average size woman, and I found the shorter length to be great.  No need to have a super long stylus.  Especially when using with a smaller device, like an iPad Mini or an iPod, the smaller size is a plus.  If it were longer, it actually wouldn't work with the loop on the side of my iPad Mini case.The writing end of the stylus, although probably technically a metal of some sort (it's kind of shiny like metal) is actually really smooth.  I've got a Tech Armor screen protector on my iPad, and I haven't seen a single scratch show up on my screen protector.  The iPad is quite responsive to the stylus.  No problems with the stylus getting stuck (a problem I've read for those with rubber tips), and the iPad seems to always respond to it.I've been using the stylus largely in a note-taking app.  Specifically, I've been drawing and lettering.  Let me tell you, a stylus, and this stylus in particular, is SOOOO much better than trying to draw with your hand.  If you do any drawing or note taking at all, buy these immediately.  You'll be so glad you have them.Since I've been using them for drawing, though, I did notice what might be the one drawback.  The writing end of the stylus is rounded off, as shown in most of the pictures.  The problem is, when you're doing small detail work while drawing, it's sometimes hard to position it in the exact right spot to make your next stroke.  Without a fine pointed tip, your view of the area you're drawing is blocked by the somewhat large end of the stylus.  So, when you're doing tiny stuff, you might have to erase a few times to get things just right.  Not a big deal, and certainly wouldn't be applicable to most people, but just something to mention for those who do plan to draw with it.My kids love these, and have started stealing mine to use on their iPods, so I guess I'll be purchasing more.  I won't go looking for others, I'll buy more of these, as they do the job well.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review133" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-01-25:</strong> Ive owned every iphone that has been released and a constant since the begining has been protection. Ive always wanted my screen protected. The only problem though, is that screen protectors are never easy to put on. This is my fifth year with an iPhone, and screen protectors are still not easy to put on. It's taken five years, but the problem ends here. With this product you get a two-piece plastic case, a wet cleaning cloth and a dry-cleaning cloth, a microfiber cloth, and a screen protector. there is a video to watch for installation but you really don't need it. The process is simple. You just clean your phone with a wet one, dry it with the dry one, put your screen protector in the bottom of your backplate upside down,pull off the sticky coating of the back of the screen protector, put your phone in upside down and push make sure that the screen protector sticks, remove your phone flip it over, remove the second protective film, and put on the other plastic cover and you're done. This product takes the guesswork out of putting on a screen protector and you don't have to worry about getting it on straight.Pros-genius screen protector application, quality materials, awesome design with textured backplate for extra grip. white iphone fits perfectly, on the table designCons-black iphone has a tiny bit of space in the case and you can sometimes hear it move a little. Not a deal breaker. The way the case is designed makes the front piece fragile, wouldnt take much to break it when its off the phone. Its not going to take much more than one good drop to break it, the camera opening is bigger than most and you will prob touch the lens by accident a lot.Overall this case is awesome. Other than some other colors, there is not really much more that could be done to improve this case. This case is staying on my phone for a while!!!!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review134" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-15:</strong> I've tried other stylus pens, but some seemed a bit too firm on my iPad. They are mostly rubber tip and damage kind of quickly. The rubber tip also leaves streak marks on my iPad which I found really distracting. I decided to try a different type, with the micro fiber tip because I didn't know what to expect. Most common ones you see are the rubber tip but sometimes the rubber sticks to the screen and it doesn't let me write as accurately. This works great for when I write notes on my iPad. I use notes a lot on PowerPoints or using GoodNotes on PDFs. So writing before was a bit more tedious, but using this has helped a lot with writing a bit faster because there's less friction (more friction with the rubber because it can stick a bit).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review135" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-18:</strong> I've tried out way too many different types of styluses, all of which have had a rubber tip.

I wish the click mechanism was better, as sometimes it doesn't click all the way and it takes me a couple attempts to get it to stay clicked down. Also, I find them a tad on the short side - just an extra half inch would make them the size of a real pen. I have big hands so needed to wrap around something smaller makes my hand cramp up after a while. All in all, a pretty good buy considering the price.Pros:Nice micro-knit designSimple yet effectiveGlides nicely on "naked" screens and smooth screen protectors (works GREAT with my iPad)Good capacitive touchCons:It kept catching on my wet application screen protectors (you know the "stickier" types - Zagg, ExtremeGuard, etc.) It's impossible to use these with those types of screen protectors. It kept jumping off the protector and took WAY longer to type up a text than by hand because of all the mistakesIf you have a big hand, you'll probably do better with a longer stylus than this oneAll in all, great little stylus for "naked" screens, especially for the price.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review138" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-16:</strong> I wanted a stylus with a retractable tip, so I wouldn't end up dragging grunge and dirt across my screen.

I used the product with an iPhone 5 with and without the Griffin Survivor case, an iPad (1st gen), and my MacBook Pro track pad. I used the stylus for simple data input on these devices and input. Screen response was good on the iPad and iPhone 5 (equivalent to using my finger). Screen response was fair using the iPhone 5 in the Griffin Survivor case (slightly worse than my finger tip). Mouse response on my MacBook Pro was surprisingly good. I actually thought that it was easier to select text using the stylus than my finger.This device could be improved with three design changes. First, the tip needs to be more firm to provide the user with a more positive tactile feel. Using a light touch doesn't always create enough contact to make it work. Using a heavy touch flattens the stylus tip and you loose the fine accuracy you hope to gain using a stylus.  I suspect that the stylus would have responded better with the Griffin Survivor case if the stylus tip was firmer which would create better contact with the case cover and the iPhone glass. Second, putting a ball point pen on the reverse side of the stylus would be great. I'm not exactly sure how that would be designed, but it would be nice to be able to just flip the pen around in your hand when changing writing surfaces. It would also be one less thing to carry around in your pocket. Third, the stylus needs to be a bit longer to create a better balance in your hand.I used the stylus with gloves in the field extensively last weekend. I have to say that data input in the freezing cold was a breeze and the stylus met my expectations.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review143" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-09-05:</strong> I was going to order a stylus from a different company.

I can retract the tip and put it in my purse, without worrying about the tip getting destroyed or out of shape. The tip seems a little soft sometimes, but it could just be me pressing too hard, since you don't really have to press the tip very much at all to use it.

Like those other items (a few battery packs and an iPad case), this one did not disappoint. The stylus has a very nice feel in the hand. It has a comfortable amount of weight to it. If it was too light, it would feel cheap. If it was too heavy, it would feel cumbersome. But the weight of this stylus is just right; it feels like a high-quality product. Additionally, I like the grooves on the shaft of this stylus. I can't explain it exactly, but it seemed to give me a better grip and simply felt nice in the hand. Also, the styling differentiates it from any of my pens. While it looks similar to a pen, I can immediately pick it out of my bag based on the distinctive look of the stylus. As for the actual capabilities of this device, I've found it extremely responsive and accurate (on both my iPad 2 and my HTC Evo 4G smartphone)...hah, it might be cheating, but I feel like it's giving me a leg up in "Draw Something" and a few other games that I've found it to be useful.

This stylus is a great deal for the product you get, and you get 2!This stylus is constructed very well, and feels very durable to me.  It's modeled to be just like a pen, although a couple inches shorter in length.  It's a click style, so the pad can retract in and pop right out.  The pad is wonderfully constructed, and looks like it will last a very long time.  It's round in shape, and this is really my only negative.  Don't get me wrong, I feel I'm being picky here, but if it was more triangular, this would be the perfect stylus.  Regardless, it's still such a good stylus.  The round tip just made it feel a little bit bigger, and if it had more of a point, it would feel like a pen.  But I'm sure the round shape helps would durability.  All a game of trades.It glides well across different surfaces.  I do have a skinomi screen protector on one of our screens, and it works good 97% of the time.  The other 3% it kind of drags a smidge.  But for all glass surfaces and more of a slicker screen protector, it works great.

I have some skin problems and I use a LOT of hand-cream, which makes a touch screen iffy for me.  I also have scarred finger-tips so my Kindle was not useful to me because I couldn't tell where I was 'touching' and was constantly mis-spelling things.  Got a stylus and discovered IT HELPS.However -- a lot of stylus's just don't transmit the data well -- the foam ones just don't seem to transmit the "touch" well and evenall micro-tip pens are NOT alike.  THIS one is SO responsive.  It's SO much better than any other one I've had -- evne the other micro-knit tipped ones!!Doesn't bother me that it's short (in fact I like it because it's not so bulky to fasten to my Kindle).The OTHER THING I ***REALLY*** like about this is the "clip" -- I've bought a couple of $25 stylus's only to have the clip fall off the darned things in a week.  Well shoot -- you gotta keep it WITH the device (I'm not a guy -- I don't have a zillion pockets!!) -- and this has a nice strong clip on it that is firmly attached enough that I can slip it over the elastic on my kindle case and it STAYS THERE!!!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review166" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-29:</strong> My previous stylus was one of those cheap rubber-tipped ones that cost maybe $2. It only kind of worked (did not always notice that I moved it or touched it), and it smudged my phone screen when used. The NT63T beats anything I have used before hands down. It has a click system like a pen, to retract or extend the stylus. I like that, as I leave it in my pocket most of the time. It's convenient to know it is always there. The material is a kind of super-fine metal (I think) mesh, which is very sturdy, yet does not scratch my phone screen at all. It works well; when I touch the screen or move this, I get response just like with my finger.I have an Android and an iPhone. For Android, I use Swype for most typing or letters, so in that case, the stylus is not as good as my finger (I can Swype one handed using my thumb). But, for number entry or serial numbers and the like (where auto-correction is not needed), the stylus is great. It is very precise on the input, much better than using my finger.For the iPhone, this unit is preferred all the time. I often have issues texting or sending emails with the iPhone, as I tend to &#34;fat-finger&#34; my messages, and frequently have to correct my typing. With this stylus, this is not an issue. It is very precise, and using it to create emails or messages is really easy.At $10.95 for a 2-pack, the price is a little higher than the rubber-tipped ones, but for the quality of this item, it is well worth it and a great price for the Rolls Royce of styluses. I'd give this a 4.5 out of 5 stars, just because I do not use it 100% of the time with Android.  If you have an iPhone, this will save you a lot of typing issues on that tiny keypad area.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review167" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-09-23:</strong> My views on using a stylus with my touch screen devices has taken a turn for the better after purchasing and using this product.

(TwinPack: Black + White)My experience with  Styluses in the past has been disappointing to say the least. Mostly I have used them if I am cooking and using my smartphone or tablet to look up recipes and the stylus helps to avoid getting the the screen dirty.I have owned a few different styluses over the years and although they seem to work well enough, they simply don&#8217;t last! The tips are generally made of some rubbery tip that eventually either falls off or develops cracks.I have probably wasted a great deal of money by buying cheap styluses. I always thought that there really were NO other options than the &#8220;disposable&#8221; versions that I was used to.The New Trent Arcadia stylus has a Micro-knit Tip that really seems like it will go the distance. Not only, does the tip seem durable, but it also has the ability to be retracted. This helps to keep it lint free and protect it from getting damaged while in your pocket or purse.Another quality feature of this stylus is the clip on the side. Other clips tend to bend or not have enough holding power to keep it in place. I have indeed lost 2 styluses because they would not stay in place.I would rate this product 5-stars out of 5.For about $10 dollars, you get 2 Styluses. Don&#8217;t settle for cheap alternatives.

I use them with my iPad and my iPhone 5S. Both have a screen protector, but the pen works fine. The retraction mechanism is a great idea. I like being able to retract the tip when not in use to decrease damage. Best of all, the tip slides very nicely over the screen. This is much better than the rubber tips that do not flow as well over the surface. The pen is just about the right length. The only problem is the tip sticks too far out of the pen when in use. There is a plastic guard you can add to the pen that slightly lengthens the pen and decreases how much the tip sticks out, but it would have been nice to have the incorporated in the design of the pen.

The iPad Air has a Tech Armor Protective Screen cover and the NewTrent Rugged Keyboard Case, and was equally responsive to the Stylus. Nice!APPEARANCE AND CONSTRUCTIONBoth the Black and the White stylus are very cleanly and sleekly designed, I was asked while working with it a Starbucks this past weekend who made/designed it and where did I buy it - I know it is only one instance, but you are on the money with the design!Construction appears to be very sturdy, and the spring loaded button atop the stylus feels very stout - great for durability.Overall, I rate the stylus a &#34;5&#34; out of &#34;5&#34;. My only constructive criticism is that having a pen function adjoined to the current design would make it for one less need for a pen - though I could argue that by virtue of running a virtually paperless business and of having a stylus (and presumably an iPhone/iPad on me in tandem), I would not have any regular need for a pen!

While they have all been good, the mesh tip on New Trent's is a much appreciated improvement over the old rubber ones. Over time the rubber ones can wear out and start to "grip" the screen, which makes it difficult to use. The metal mesh on New Trent's does not have this issue at all. I was a bit concerned that the metal would scratch my screen, but it is soft enough and has not been an issue.I also appreciate the fact that it clicks and retracts like a normal pen, and is put together quite well. My only concern is that it is fairly small, and I have gotten used to a wider stylus. Even my everyday pen (Pilot G2) is thicker and has a bit more weight. I would like to see a larger stylus in the future. I would also like to see the mesh tip shrink down in the next version.But these issues are small, and will not keep me from using the new stylus in the future.

I have to say that it is an amazing improvement over the rubber or foam tipped stylus. Here is the quick run down.Smoothly glides over my iPad's surface (with screen protector)Much more responsive than my previous stylus (rubber tip)Long lasting (explain further on)Love the clicking featureFeels solidOverall I this stylus set is great, works flawlessly with my iPad, I even tried it out with my iPod touch and the touch pad in my laptop, all with amazing results.  I tried both my previous stylus and the Arcadia stylus side by side and knew right away that the micro knit tip is the way to go. In comparison to the rubber tip pen I am not sure what happened but after a good bit of use with games and such it lost its accuracy and was not as responsive to the point I just has to trow it away.  I put one of the Arcadia stylus pens to the test with my siblings and so far it is still going strong. The click pen feature is very nice especially because it keeps the tip protected from other wear and tear when it is not in used. And lastly, the stylus overall feels really solid not hollow like other stylus pens out there.  Like any product there is always room for improvement here are just a couple points that I noticed. The clicking mechanism seemed not to beas "clean" in its clicks and unfortunately in one of the stylus that I had the mechanism became locked and left the tip out, I tried several methods but was unable to get it back in, which overall the stylus still works perfectly. Last which it that sometimes the tip would be a bit squeaky, but this just kind of comes and goes so it is not a big issue. Overall, this stylus is much better than any rubber tipped stylus I have tried, it is smooth, responsive, and small enough to carry with you everywhere.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review179" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-06-19:</strong> Pros:1.

I like the tip haveing the ability to retract. Where as every other brand out their having a Rubber Stylus has a fixed tip. Trent has the fore sight in their inovation to have this model with that capability. Protecting the tip will is important from damage is paamount. I also order the Trent IMP62B with the ball point pen tip. I like having 2-ea. for the price and always have a back up o hand. I'm happy with this purchase and recommend this product. I had rubber stylus products before and found it did not work out for me.

I will say, I'm not much of a stylus user except when using an application like Evernote or another note taking application for work.  I'm trying to get into it for web browsing as well. I own two other types of Stylus. One is Bamboo, which has a rubber tip, and another is a company generic stylus/pen with a rubber tip. The Imp63T beats them both by a long shot. It is longer, wider, and more stable. I believe that the micro knit tip is better than the rubber. I compared the two on my ipad and iphone. The mirco tip can glide easier, while the rubber has a slight advantage on pressing accuracy. Given that, the knit tip is my preferred stylus because I could adapt my technique as a new user.  Applications I tested were Evernote, My Singing monsters, note pad, snailbob, web browsing, Urban pad, tasks, email, General setting options, and Angry Birds. I didn't havea problem with those applications and the stylus.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review188" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-15:</strong> !!!!Shorter list review below paragraph if lazy!!!!I received the styluses 2 days after my order. As a student who has to use an iPad all day for writing notes, I was extremely excited to come home to see that the styluses had arrived. I was not let down. Not surprisingly, after all... these styluses have practically five stars after thousands of reviews. They came in a plastic wrap which contained a pouch with the styluses in them and also a card about beta testing a giveaways. The pouch was a nice touch. I decided against keeping both of the styluses with me at the same time because I tend to lose my pens. The styluses themselves are nice and sleek. The body is metal and colored white or black. It's shiny and nice, however if you have sweaty palms it could be sort of annoying to hold. I didn't have a problem with it myself however. The styluses also have a clip which I have used to keep it from slipping out of my pocket. And one of the two redeeming features is that it's retractable. Not only does the retract-ability give it more of a sense of professionalism but it also gives extra protection for the tip. The tip however, doesn't really require the protection. It's sturdy. Which brings me to the second redeeming feature: the cloth/mesh tip. Because it is a mesh tip, it glides across the screen much easier than a rubber tipped stylus. It also means that the tip does not degrade easily. I've been using mine for about 2 months now and it's been great and is just like new. I have, however, lost one of mine. I'm disappointed cause it was such a great stylus but I just got out my other stylus. I'll probably be buying a second pack in case I lose my next one. Two styluses for $10 is a great deal especially when they're high quality and classy looking styluses!PROS-Great price, value, and quality.-Sturdy.-Looks classy and professional.-Glides easily on screen, unlike rubber tipped styluses.-Tip is mesh and doesn't get damaged easily.-Tip is retractable. Gives it protection and professional feel.-Solid feel.-Shiny metal body.CONS (depending on the person)-It is about 4.5 inches. Perfect for me but might be too small for some other people.All in all, unless you have small hands, I highly recommend this.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review189" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-09:</strong> Should have read the description more closely as I was not aware these are "mini" stylus.

The build quality is very good -- in fact, I was surprised, given the price. The stylus is retractable, controlled by a top-mounted button. It's a good, solid mechanism. The pocket clip is strong. I chose not to go with one of the models with the tether that inserts into the headphone port.

The mesh tip makes this stylus write reallllllyyyyy smoothly. However, using it with a screen protector doesn't seem as responsive as using it without a screen protector. I have to press slightly harder than I would normally, which is problematic when writing/taking notes. Dragging the stylus across the screen doesn't register a touch unlike with most rubber tipped styluses.

I prefer the size because I can tuck it away in smaller places and it's still long enough for a good grip. My only concern is that the tip it made up of a fabric-y material and I'm a little worried that it will fry eventually. But honestly it's showing no signs of that happening at all.

Especially when I use it to write in chinese it makes my life 100 times easier because allows a more percise stoke work compared to me using my finger and causes less errors. Not just chinese though it also helps that its easier to write it out in english rather then typing. One of the biggest pros of the item that I do admire is the mesh tip or the actual title the mico-knit tip. I had previous experience in using plastic tips which i never liked cause if you apply enough pressure it leave streak marks across the screen (which doesnt leave lasting marks but still takes some effort to remove). This mesh tip stylus removes that problem. Another pro is that with it stylus I feel safer letting a kid play with the ipad instead of the direct contact with their fingers, because of the rough pressure they sometimes place on the ipad the stylus reduces some of that force. Dont know if it was a part of the actual stylus or not but the small plastic cover near the tip was a great thing cause i tend to forget to click and start to write, if that plastic cap/cover wasnt there I am pretty sure there would have been a few scratches on the ipad and iphone, due to me trying to write with the metal portion without the mesh tip extended.In terms of Cons theres not much. It is still easier to type and do general functions using my hands because depending on the activitiy the stylus can become clumbersome at times. Even though it is applicable with the iphone as well as ipad it is much easier to use it on the ipad just because of the surface area the ipad provides.The use of the stylus is great but carrying it around does tend to get annoying unless you have a bag or something to place it in.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review195" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-17:</strong> So it seems New Trent has listened to its customers and brought out an even better stylus than the previous version with the woven tip. Let me back up and explain, my only complaint of the other version of the stylus with the woven tip is that the woven material begins to unravel/fray if kept in a bag or in something that picks at the material. This stylus avoids that by retracting the woven tip inside the body of the stylus thus protecting it from wear and tear.I believe this new design will extend the life of the stylus and make it stay in much better shape that the previous one. The tip works just the same though and until you try this woven material, you won&#8217;t understand how much better it functions than a regular rubber tip on other styluses. It makes the biggest difference when using my iPad and iPad mini to take hand written notes and drawings.The only additional comments I would make is the stylus comes in a two pack (one black, one white) and it would be nice if there were some other color options to choose from (like a more metallic silver or gold, etc.) I would also suggest an option to order a longer stylus for those of us who have large hands as it would make it easier to hold and write with.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review196" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-29:</strong> (Some of my comparisons will be made to the IMP62B stylus, which I also own).I really like this type of stylus. The woven tip is so much more responsive than standard rubber tips. I also love that it's retractable. This means that if I carry it in my pocket I don't have to worry about it getting damaged at all.One major improvement I noticed with this stylus over the IMP62B is the weight of it. It has quite a bit more and this makes it easier to use on tablets.One thing I did notice, in terms of product feedback, would be that the tip didn't feel quite as firm as the IMP62B. It felt like I had to push pretty hard on a few occasions for the apps to recognize the stylus. I tried in a few different apps to make sure it wasn't just the one app and had similar results. Maybe making it more firm like the other would help with over responsiveness.This stylus could also be a bit longer. Those of us with larger hands find smaller stylus not fitting well in our hands. I'm not saying an inch longer or anything, but maybe 1/4&#34; - 1/2&#34; longer.Overall, this is a good stylus and I see myself getting really good use out of it across my devices. I would rate it 4/5 overall.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review197" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-02:</strong> So this was a nice surprise and a great stylus. Over the years I've owned several styluses. This one by far is my favorite. Right out of the box I noticed the nice design and retractable point of the stylus at the end. What a great idea to make it like a regular pen. So many of my old styluses have either been worn out or lost. This one the tip goes inside to keep it from getting ruined so it looks just like a pen. The one change to this that would make it absolutely epic perfect would be one click on the pen shows the stylus and the next click shows a pen that actually writes on paper.

To appeal to kids, add childish designs. To appeal to the classier, add a leather barrel. To appeal to aesthetics, add a carbon fiber barrel. And slap a NewTrent logo on there. Nothing is worse than a person asking a customer where they got a product and have them forget the name. The metal clip is very stiff, so its hard to clip it onto a ipad case/backpack pencil holder. Product feel and quality is good. The plastic tip that came with it was confusing--didn't know if I should take it off or keep it on. I took it off. It was unclear because the plastic was hard, and not bad quality like most packing materials. In addition, it was tightly put on, and slightly hard to get off (for a packaging item). Stylus length is good.Writing with a ball is hard--Starting off I had to get used to the fact that only a small point on the tip would touch the screen, which is fine, but I believe that a smaller tip would make more sense. Also, when I initially looked for styluses, I firs looked for those "plastic" pens for signing credit card readers at grocery markets. Couldn't find any, possibly that would be a nice place for expansion. Ultimately, the micro fiber is an excellent approach for touch screens.Overall, excellent product.

The exterior has a solid feel to it, much like a well-crafted pen--not too light, not too heavy. The clicker has a nice, tight spring feel to it. Sometimes, cheaper pens have a bit of slack that you feel in the gap between the button and the engagement of the spring as you depress the clicker button. Not so on the IMP63. The fiber tip is soft, but solid feeling due to its metallic make up. I've heard that other styluses have rubber tips and that their reduced durability can be problematic. I suspect that that's not an issue with the IMP63. The tip provided a solid interaction with my iPad and iPhone. The IMP63 offers more precise control than my fingers when tapping about on my touch screens. I particularly enjoy the compact nature of the IMP63. I love that it is short and that it is retractable. We live in a world of compact devices, so it makes sense that a stylus is short, but not too short. Good product.

I did find that if you try to touch the screen at an angle with the stylus, you will not always get the screen to recognize your touch.Overall, I still prefer to use my fingers over a stylus, but I would not consider myself the type of user that would benefit drastically one way or another from a stylus, no matter how good one is. However, this one seems to be one of the better on the market right now.I would rate this stylus set a 4/5, because it doesn't make me think it's a better solution than my fingers.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review216" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-11:</strong> The New Trent stylus, both black and white, are very responsive when I use them with my iPhone 5.

It's well-constructed, no gaps in the metal, the paint doesn't wear off in a day, and shape is stylish and attractive.Inside: The retracting spring works smoothly with no failure.Nib: The nib is softer than it looks in the pictures. I was a bit worried when I purchased it that it would actually scratch the surface because of the metallic look. But no fear! It's a soft microfiber that glides safely and gently across the surface.I previously purchased a stylus through The Friendly Swede and it was totally junky looking and feeling. The end was rubber and wide. It looked cheap and felt even worse.

They are super portable and the capacitive tip is small enough that it can be used on a variety of devices not only tablets. I used it on my iPhone 4S, iPad 3G, and my iPad Mini and it worked great! The pen has a really nice clip for notebooks or for shirt pockets for you to use to clip it onto which is great so you don&#8217;t misplace them&#8230;and if you do that&#8217;s the perk of ordering a twin-pack! The stylus is great for reading, typing, signing things, and even just browsing the Internet, as it doesn&#8217;t smudge the screen like your finger would which is really nice. I highly recommend these styluses for anyone who wants to speed up their productivity when on tablets or on their phone or who have chubby fingers and can&#8217;t use the apple on-screen keyboards as effectively. These are truly very handy to have and can even make great gifts for any gadget savvy friend. I give these styluses a 5 out of 5 on their effectiveness, as they are remarkable.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review219" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-09:</strong> The NT63T Stylus is a great addition to my Tech Bag. I love the fact that you can retract the tip to keep it from being damaged. The clip on the pen seems a little unnecessary to me because I just put the stylus in my bag with my iPad. The stylus is a good fit and length for working on my iPad. It however is not very accurate for writing notes. I use this more for skimming through pages on the iPad or for quick little notes anything more detailed would require a finer point like a pencil.  I give this a 3 STAR for usability but would prefer a finer point for writing.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review220" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-22:</strong> The NT63T Twin Pack of Arcadia Micro-Knit Styli is huge step up in capacitive styli. Before using this stylus, I had only used the rubber-tip type, which left a lot to be desired.*For this review I tested the styli on a Google/LG Nexus 5, Samsung Galaxy S4, Apple iPad (2nd Generation), and HP TouchpadBuild Quality (4/5):The stylus is very light but feels well-built. It weighs about 13 grams, which is less than a full-sized pen (a Cross, plastic-body, ball-point pen weighs 27 grams). It is also shorter than a full-sized pen, coming in at just over 4 inches (not counting the button) versus just over 5.5 for the Cross pen. I have relatively small hands, so this didn't present an issue, but for people with larger hands that are accustomed to full-sized pens/pencils, the length of this stylus may feel a little awkward. The center of mass seems to be right around (and slightly behind) where my thumb rests on the barrel, which is very comfortable; I found that I could use it for moderate periods (~5-10 minutes for tapping, swiping, using on-screen swype-style keyboards, etc.) without having to re-position or re-adjust my grip.The retractable tip is a nice feature, as it offers some protection from accumulating dirt/dust/lint as well as protection for the micro-knit fiber tip.Screen Feel (5/5):This is where the stylus shines. The difference between this and a rubber-tip type stylus is night and day. The micro-knit fabric allows the stylus to glide across the screen and doesn't stick, grab, skip, or 'chatter' when swiping. I used it directly on glass screens, on 'crystal-clear' and matte adhesive screen protectors, and on an 'integrated' screen protector that was part of a protective cover/case. The stylus worked well on all surfaces and felt much smoother than any rubber-tip type styli I've used in the past.Precision (3/5):The tip of this stylus is still relatively wide. It is not marketed as a 'fine-tip' stylus, so I wasn't expecting a Galaxy Note-like tip, but with the width of the tip and the extra 'give' because it's soft and pliable, it does not work well as a writing stylus. It serves extremely well for tapping and swiping the screen, but it only has a significant advantage over fingers if you have extremely large fingers, or you want to keep fingerprints and smudges off the screen. The other advantage it offers is the ability to use it while wearing gloves. I tested out a pair of light winter gloves and confirmed that I could NOT tap or swipe the screen with my fingers, but even in my gloved hand the stylus performed well.Responsiveness (4/5):The stylus does not have any missed taps or swipes, and does not require hard presses.Overall (4/5):This is a great stylus, and is a welcome change from the older rubber-tip type styli. I would recommend this for anyone who uses tablets or smartphones with larger screens, and does the occasional writing/sketching. It is also ideal for keeping the screen clean and clear of fingerprints, smudges, and dust/dirt.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review221" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-07:</strong> then you'll love these.

I love the fact that the NT63T retracts so the tip doesn't get damaged when I through it with all of my things like many other styluses I've used, and I absolutely love the micro-knit tip. It just slides right across the screen with the most responsive touches. It is by far way more responsive than any other stylus I have ever used, which is why I will never go back to anything less. I actually love this thing so much, I would love to see variations of it. I don't mind the size of the stylus now, but because I have large hands, I sometimes loose grip on the stylus. I would love to see a slightly larger version, which maybe could be weighted a bit more to feel like a nice pen. I would definitely pay for that. Heck, put this micro-knit tip on pretty much anything and I would use it. It really is just amazing that I haven't seen any other styluses with this kind of tip before.Overall, I would give the NT63T a 5 out of 5 stars because of just how wonderful it performs.

I have about three kinds of stylus and I haven't found much difference in them as far as using on the phone itself.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review255" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-21:</strong> The stylus works great and the retractable tip works great and doesn't feellike it will break any time soon. It feels like a normal pen in my hands,except that it's just slightly short, but still usable. The overall buildquality feels suburb. I tested the stylus on multiple devices and performedgreat on all of them. It works great with the iPhone 4S/5/5S and iPad 3rdgeneration. It also works great with my kindle and galaxy s4. It was mostuseful on the kindle and iPad as their larger screens made it moreefficient to use a stylus when navigating, drawing (Draw Something), orwriting (Chinese handwriting input). The stylus would be great for peoplewho use handwriting input and basic drawing and notes. It doesn't have theprecision to be used for very detailed drawing. The only issue I have withit is that I had a few fibers stick out and I'm not sure how long the tipis designed to last. I have a Bamboo stylus with a rubber head I currentlyuse and they seem very on par. I would give the product a 5 out of 5, for aroughly $5 stylus it does its job and does it well and has great buildquality.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review256" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-10:</strong> The two styluses come in a pretty simple clear vinyl case.

Rather than the standard soft foam tip, these stylus are a micro-knit fiber with a texture similar to a fingerprint.

Everything ends up in my pockets at times, and I always worry that I'll rip the nub off the end of my other stylus. Not an issue with these guys, since the entire tip retracts inside the  body of the stylus.Dos Equis' Most Interesting Man In The World doesn't usually use a stylus, but when he does, this would definitely be the one.Even better, is that you're getting two of these styli for about the price most manufacturers charge for one.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review263" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-07-13:</strong> This is hands down the best available stylus on the market.

I have used the product on several different devices and overall, I am happy with the product. Functionally it worked great on my android phone and on Apple phones and Ipods, even on my laptop's mouse pad (although not very practical). The product controls swiping easily but took a little getting used to for button pressing, such as texting, I think due to the amount of give in the tip. Once I got used to it and realized that I just had to press a little harder the product worked great. I like the fabric tip but think the idea of having multiple tips to swap out with might be a good idea, such as a more fine point rigid tip. A rigid tip would be more helpful for games like Draw Something, although the stylus as it is now was much better than my finger. The size and form of the device are great though. I would like if the pocket clip was not quite as tight and possibly a little more toward the clicker end so as to not stick so far out of my pocket. I was not sure if the clear plastic piece on the end is supposed to remain on the stylus or not but I like it to prevent accidentally touching my screen with the metal should I forget to eject the tip. I do also like the retractable clip.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review267" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-17:</strong> This New Trent stylus is the best one that I've found.

My first instinct was to go to the major Apple accessory makers like Griffin or Wacom but after a quick spin of the Amazon reviews I took a chance with the micro-knit style stylus.  Good decision.  I would have been happy with the quality and design if I had only received one, but two knocked it out of the park.  I like the micro-knit, it glides over my Nexus 7 without a screen protector and does the same on our Ipad with protector.  The retractable nib keeps the mesh from getting dirty or pulled out of shape and the size is compact enough to clip inside your pocket.  I'd like to see a redesign of the tip as it is a bit less streamlined than the rest of the stylus, but aside from that, I highly recommend it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review269" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-18:</strong> This product has lived up to all of my expectations and adeqately fulfills my needs for an instrument to facilitate navigating in my iPad 4th generation with retina display and iPhone5.The two colors, black and white, are both bright and sharp, and the pen is silky-smooth to the touch.

I have never had a stylus and saw these so I figured I would give them a try.The package comes with two stylus pens: black and white; otherwise identical. These are pretty small and compact at about 2&#34; long and the thickness of a regular pen. They both have a pocket clip and feel strong because they are made of metal. The tip retracts like a normal pen.Because I have never used a stylus, I am not sure what is normal or not. I am used to barely tapping the iScreens with my finger especially when dragging and with this stylus you have to press with a decent amount if force for the screen to detect the pen. I found this to be annoying and frequently had to redo whatever movement I was trying. Maybe this will get better the more I use it? Again, not sure if this is a design flaw or just how styluses work. I found that the stylus was too big for portrait on the iPhone keyboard - I kept pressing multiple keys at once. It worked perfectly fine on the iPad keyboard and of course scrolling on both devices was fine.I would really like it if these were dual purpose - a pen on one side and the stylus on the other. I can't really see myself carrying this around unless it was functional with a pen also. This would be most beneficial for people who use a tablet for a business - especially when you take payment from customers and require them to sign on the screen.It's hard to give this a rating because I don't know if the issues I had are typical with stylus eons or a design flaw. Because I trust New Trent products, I am going to give New Trent the benefit of the doubt and give this 4 stars.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review272" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-06-18:</strong> This review is from: New Trent IMP63B Stylus/Styli Touch Screen Cell phone Tablet Pen with Micro-Knit Technology Capacitive Stylus for iPhone 4 4s iPod touch iPad 2 Samsung Galaxy Motorola Xoom Blackberry Playbook, Barnes and Noble Nook (Black Color) (Electronics)I got this stylus to replace my IMP62B, which is I think my four-year old may have hidden from me. The IMP63B is similar in form factor, only instead of having a retractable ball point pen, it has a retractable stylus head. The ball point has been left out of this model. This turns out to be a trade-off I can live with.Both styluses have a capacitive mesh head, which although more durable than the rubber-type stylus heads that you usually see, can still be damaged after a while. Making the stylus head retractable mitigates this issue wonderfully. With a satisfying "click" the stylus head can be retracted or extended.In addition, a soft, removable plastic sleeve comes pre-installed, through which the stylus head can easily pass. This is significant; While the retractable stylus head is very useful/practical, it took a period of adjustment before I consistently remembered to extend the head before applying it to my screen. The included plastic sleeve protected my screen from damage when I did forget. Within a couple of days I stopped forgetting and I have since removed the sleeve without issue. If you are generally forgetful about things like this I recommend leaving the sleeve on.Like the IMP62B, this stylus is a bit smaller than you might expect (a tad longer than my middle finger, from knuckle to fingertip). At first, I was a bit disappointed by this. But, I soon began to realize the advantage of having a slightly smaller stylus. I clip it to my jeans pocket before I run out the door. Or, if I am dressed a bit more formally, I will put it in my shirt pocket - when clipped to my pocket it looks like a regular business-style pen. I think the size of the stylus present s a good balance between usability and portability.So, the overall design of the pen was well thought out. But what set this stylus apart from the others is the material used to make the tip. The screen of my new iPad (3rd Generation) is extremely responsive to the micro-fiber material, with very little pressure applied.Not only is the tip more responsive, but it is less resistive, as well. Most rubber styluses feel like they are going to rip apart as you drag them across the screen. When I drag the tip across the screen, there is little friction. It glides, nice and smooth.The IMP63B is magnetic and will actually stick to an iPad smart cover! It even stays on when flipped upside down. Just don't shake it back and forth....I've read review for this product as well as other products in which the reviewers state that the stylus was unresponsive on the screen or that they had to press hard. I've found that any input device works better without a screen protector. If you are going to use a screen protector, get a high quality one, not the cheap one that came with the iPad case you bought on eBay for $10.00. The quality of screen protector will make a huge difference in performance with a stylus.The seller was hassle free and the stylus was shipped the same day I ordered it. This is one of many products I have ordered from New Trent and none have failed to please yet.Pros- Retractable head extends life of the product.- Micro fiber mesh material is super smooth and responsive.- Very portable and easy to pocket.- Sticks to magnets in iPad smart cover- Fast shipping, prime eligible- Plastic sleeve on tip protects screenCons- Slight learning curve - you have to train yourself to remember to extend the stylus head- You have to be willing to use a slightly smaller stylus to gain the benefits of portability.Overall, this is a really nice stylus and I would recommend it to anyone who need something responsive and compact.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review273" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-13:</strong> This set is really good.

The micro-knit head of the stylus is much better than any rubber tipped head stylus.  It is also unique because the tip of the stylus is retractable so it is less likely to get anything sticky or gooey on it.  To me it feels like it gives a softer touch than I would use with my finger and we all know that our fingers are oily and leaves prints on the screen.  As &#8220;Red&#8221; said on the Blacklist &#8220;Don&#8217;t those fingerprints bother you on the screen?  They do me.&#8221;  This is a tool that will help you get rid of those annoying fingerprints.  I have used the New Trent Stylus  on my iPad 4, Kindle Fire, Nook, and HTC phone.

I was not very happy with that stylus after I downloaded an app for note taking on my iPad, which has a screen protector. I had expected to be able to take notes like I was using pencil or pen. Instead it was better to use my finger or even a dead AA battery.I had read a lot of reviews for the top 10 tablet styluses and I assumed I was going to be stuck with this Kuel or another more expensive stylus that would not be any better except I could replace the rubber tips when they wore out after a few months of heavy use. I do a lot of not taking on the iPad and the finger was not a viable option and neither was the dead battery.I discovered a review of the New Trent Micro-Knit Retractable Stylus and did more reading about the micro fiber being used for stylus tips. I was a little reluctant after my experience with the reviews of the rubber tip styluses. After reading reviews of several different micro fiber or micro knit styluses and comparing features and price I decide to get the New Trent Arcadia 2PCS Micro-Knit Retractable Stylus (Twin Pack, Black + White). It arrived in a few days and I was very surprised at how well it glided across the screen of my iPad that is often used in my studio, on location and in lecture/workshop situations. It is also used y customers to sign for their credit card purchases when I use Square. I have no regrets about my purchase and will by another set to have in my go bag as back up when I do arts festivals.Pros: The retractable tip was the key selling point for me. Also the price for the twin pack is good which gives me a back up. It writes like a good pen with no sticking or skips. It is very responsive and feels natural.Cons: It needs to be at least 6 or 7 inches long. I also use it with a painting/drawing app besides the note taking app. on my iPad.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review284" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-10:</strong> Unlike the rubber styli, these are covered with a mesh-silver that protects between the glass and the rubber tip.This design doesn't smudge the glass at all.

I have played hundreds of games on line and am still going strong with the first one I started with. By now my rubber tipped stylus would be worn right down. Not this one. I am tired of replacing the rubber ones. They are cheap but they don't last. I don't know exactly what this tip is made of but it is long lasting.  These are about 5.00 apiece and are worth every penny because they  seem to be well put together, you can click them inside just like a pen and they work great every time. I have a screen protector over the plastic screen protector of my Otter Box and  still I don't have any issues with it.One day the silver "clicker" fell off and I was so disappointed but it had worked  so well to that point that I was going to exchange them. Plus  I still had the other one to use in the mean time. . But then I realized that it had threads and I was able to  screw it right back in!I think these will make great sticking stuffers. And you can split the package!! I'm confident after using it for this long that anyone with a smart phone or kindle that I give it to will absolutely love it as much as I do!UPDATE February 10 and they are still going strong. One is getting just a tad harder to slide. It may be my screen I'm not sure. But I've played thousands of games of candy crush, jelly splash, and ruzzle and am still going strong.

I would recommend this to anyone with atouchscreen device.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review287" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-27:</strong> Using this stylus with a Samsung Galaxy S3, as well as a Nexus 7Pros: Very nice form factor and ergonomics.  Touch screen response is superb.  The micro knit tip has much better response then the more generic foam tips.  The fact that it retracts is great so you make sure the tip doesn't get damaged.Cons: Metal clip seems stiff at first, not too hard to clip on jeans, but challenging to clip on a dress shirt.  After a couple weeks the tip seems like its starting to show very slight wear signs on the sides, but there's no loss of function.  Doesn't work well with capacitative buttons, but that might have something to do with my screen protector.  When sliding across screen it makes a squeaking noise (this is due to my armorsuit military screen protector on the galaxy s3, tested it on other the Nexus 7 with a screen protector also from armorsuit and this didn't happen).Overall I think this is a great value for the money, and a great functional product.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review288" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-15:</strong> Very good quality,,,still using both...like very much the retractable tip is a good addition to have...gave one as a gift...will order again</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review289" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-25:</strong> wanted something for my mom with her new Xmas gift.

But felt a bit of lag or a need to push a bit harder when your device is using a protective case film.- Retractable tip will help protect the tip from accidental scratches. Talk about scratches, at first I was afraid to use this stylus because it looks like the tip is made of metal and might scratch the screen of my naked iPad/iPhone. But it turns out it's smooth as baby's bottom. In fact I think that's what makes it more responsive than other stylus I tried.- I got the black, and my wife got the white.

I have been looking for 6 months for a good stylus and after 1 week trial this has performed very well. It glides across screen with minimal drag (unlike rubber tip). Sensitivity is also excellent so far. I wanted a small form factor to use on the clamp of my Nexus 7 Gen2 - Blurex case without interference.The retractable tip that protects it when traveling about is good and I removed the plastic cap on the end to get it in and out of the case easier.  I like the feel of quality metal construction and metal clip that will last longer than plastic.  It is about 4.5 inches long when tip is out.A good Stylus needs to last 6 mth to year with no loss of sensitivity.  All my old rubber tip stylus were lucky to last more than 1 to 2 months of 2 hour / day use.  I find that I hold the stylus at the end for navigating around and hold at the tip like a pen when using the hand writing note function on the tablet. It would also be nice to have a version like this that is 5 inches long for everyday use with more colors.  Overall a very nice smooth sensitive stylus that does what I was looking for.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review292" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-14:</strong> When I first opened the box I saw how elegant the stylus looked and then I picked them up and you can feel they are made with quality parts.

I wanted a pocket clip, and I wanted a  larger pen/type instrument. I originally purchased theAmazonBasics Stylus for Touchscreen Devices Including Kindle Fire HD 8.9-Inch, Kindle Fire HD 7-Inch, Kindle Fire, Apple iPad 2, iPad 3, iPad 4, iPad mini, Samsung Galaxy Tab, Nexus 7 and Nexus 10and just didn't really like it for long. I found it way too small for my hand, didn't like that it didn't have a pocket clip, and also (the biggest point) was that the actual rubber-esque point didn't seem that ideal. Carrying it around in my pocket allowed it to just be a magnet to fuzz and lint, and in general seemed like it was loosing it's shape. What good is a "pen" if you can't carry it in your pocket or clipped on your shirt? So when I saw this, it looked like exactly what I had in mind. Pocket clip, check. Appeared larger. And I loved the retracting point.After using this a couple weeks now, I highly recommend it. I do wish it was larger, but that is mostly because of having catcher mitt hands. I like the simple and professional look of the stylus. And it is extremely responsive with my screen. Using it with my Nexus 7 FHD, Samsung Galaxy Nexus, my wife's iPad Mini and her iPhone 5, it is amazing all across the board. I really find it an extremely better option than the Amazon Basic because the material used in the tip. I don't know what it is exactly, it's a mesh type fabric, and it seems like it is more responsive with capacitive touch screens than the "rubber" options, and it isn't a fuzz magnet!The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I really feel like very little is truly 5 stars. I'm a pen collector, so I have high standards when it comes to writing instruments. I mostly subtracted 1 star because I wish it were larger and because I think the pocket clip could have a degree more flexibility.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review294" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-09:</strong> When my wife `stole' my extendable stylus from New Trent, I decided to replace it with the IMP63T "Clickpen" Stylus.  I couldn't be any happier right now.  The fact that there are two included means my wife won't be leaving me empty handed this time.  After reading several reviews, I had concern about the length, but I found that it fits nicely between my fingers and works perfectly on both my iPhone and my iPad.  It clicks solidly into place and the plastic around the end works nicely for when I forget to click it into place.  The stylus isn't slipping too much, but perhaps a rubber grip or different finish might help.  The clip is very tight which means it's not going to slip out of my shirt pocket any time soon.  The white stylus squeaks a little when you use it, but the black stylus is silent and will be hidden from my wife.  I received a `rubber' tipped stylus from a co-worker over the holidays and quite honestly, the mesh fiber tip is more responsive and glides effortlessly even through my screen protectors.  I've used the stylus to play Draw Something and I still can't draw, but at least my lines are straighter.  From E-mails to Facebook posts, shopping on Amazon.com  or checking the line waits at Disneyland, this stylus does everything it promises and I would recommend buying the IMP63T over anything else you see.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review295" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-08:</strong> Within the first minute of using the the New Trent Clickpen I was sold. It has made typing and navigating on my Nexus 7 and Samsung Galaxy S3 a true breeze. Where before I was frustrated trying to type or swype because of my large fingers, I can now move through emails and web browsers with real speed. The stylus has enough weight to make it feel substantial but not so heavy you won't want to carry it around. The cushioned mesh tip of the Clickpen is soft enough to give it a nice tactile feel, but stiff enough to make copying and pasting single words or letters easy. The body of the stylus is plastic with a smooth surface, I find it can be a bit slippery when using. This could be remedied by making the body with a rubberized grip section or for the whole stylus. The retractable tip is a great way to keep the tip clean and prevent the tip getting distorted in a pocket or purse. The plastic protection guard at the tip of the stylus works well in protecting the screen of the device from getting scratched. I use the stylus constantly with my Nexus and S3 and find it clumsy to now use my fingers.I am very happy with these styluses needless to say.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review296" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-19:</strong> Works fine, nice that they send you 2 of these in difference colors.

The retractable feature is one of the best features I like because it keeps the tip protected when I have the stylus buried in a computer bag. The clip also comes in handy for clipping the stylus to a pocket. The stylus is very responsive on both my HTC phone and Galaxy Tablet.

The only thing bothering me right now is the material that the actual pointer is made out of.  Realizing it states that they are micro-knit and only having used one other stylus prior to these in my life, I understand that this is more or less an error on my behalf.

I was sick of the rubber styluses sticking to my iPad's screen and after 3 days cracking and eventually just ripping off. I searched online and found that the &#34;Micro-Knit&#34; worked best. My very first NewTrent product was the Limir dual purpose Pen/Stylus, and it is still in flawless conditions; I wanted another stylus that would look a bit more &#34;fancy&#34; for my sales job which requires me to carry an iPad around with me. I hated when I had to multitask and then I accidentally closed the browser window I was working on because of the thickness of my fingers - with this stylus, this is no longer an issue.Pros1). Stylish, looks great in suit/shirt pockets2). You get two with your purchase3). When you are not using it, you click the touch portion of the stylus inside for protection4). There is a smooth plastic right around the edges, just in case you press the stylus too hard, you won't scratch the surface of your deviceCons1). Can't really find any flaws, but I would like color/design options and a bit more smooth &#34;clicking&#34; mechanism so that there is not a &#34;scratching&#34; feeling while clicking it in and out.

I have a Skinomi screen protector installed and it had no issues at all. I then tried it on my Galaxy Note 12.2 pro and it is awesome!

I had been using the AMpen stylus for a while until I got one of these, and I would say that this is comparable to the AMPEN. This one has a smaller tip which is great, but the only problem I have is that the tip is not replaceable like the screw cap on the AMpen. I like this one because the tip doesn't stay out in the open all the time so anything that can catch on to it or whatever will be avoided. I like how this pen is sturdy when writing. I noticed that the sticking on the cloth part on this pen is of a better quality then the AM pen and is stitched together more which hopefully means that it lasts longer.As a student who writes notes on the iPad every day with heavy use, I would say that this pen is a great investment, but I wish that the tips were replaceable so I wouldn't have to spend so much each time on a new tip.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review313" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-16:</strong> This is a decent stylus for the money.

Getting the two different colors is a nice touch and they feel solidly constructed. Works wells, although sometimes requires a little more pressure for the touch to register - not a deal breaker (considering finger touch doesn't always register) just thought I'd mention.The reason for only 4 stars is because of a couple reasons:1. Haven't had for that long yet so will need to see how it holds up over the next few months. (Will update if there is a problem)2. When using the stylus, you can hear slight crackling noises coming from the stylus tip. Not sure what is causing it but it's just slightly annoying. (Doesn't change the functionality of this item in anyway)UPDATE ---- 2/10/14After some time of use the stylus tip has recessed permanently and does not stick out as far as it used to. During use, the plastic tip will hit the iPad screen unless used directly on the tip. Got NewTrent to replace these but only to have the same thing happen.

If I'm going to have one of these, I need to put it somewhere that I will have it with me all the time.  So I put them in my pocket.  With others, I'm always afraid that I'm going to damage the tip.  But with these I can retract the tip and remove that fear.  One other benefit to the retract is that (and this might have been by coincidence) the tip is smaller, which I like.I've used it on my Playbook, my wife's Android, my iPhone, my boy's IPod, and my touch screen monitor... it worked on all of them.As I mentioned earlier, I like to put these in my pocket, and they are short enough that I don't feel like I have a stiff leg when I sit down.  They also have a clip in case you want to put them in a binder, planner, or briefcase.  This particular package came with a black and white one, so I could have one at home or at work.The only downsides that I could think of was that these don't have a pen built in, so you might have to carry two things around.  Also, since they are small, they are also slick, and if you have dry hands, they might be hard to hold onto.

The felt tip is extremely smooth on the surface of my ipad.  It makes for great use when accessing all of my apps and email.  I highly recommend this tool to anyone using a ipad or tablet.  I tried it on my iphone as well and although it worked, the tip is a bit large for the small phone when trying to use the key pad.  However,  it is reasonable to use in apps that do not require typing. Because the tip is capable of being lowered into it's protective body in the style of a click pen, the tip remains safe when traveling with it in a purse of briefcase.  This feature helps ensure it's longevity!

On a scale I would rate them a strong 4. I am using them on a Nexus 4 and a Nexus 7 gen 2. Both devices have screen protectors on them so I have learned how much pressure is needed to depress what I need to. I am typing this review with one of them now. It is faster than using my fingers I believe, it feels more like writing a letter this way. Most useful when writing, browsing apps and web pages both on my tablet but especially my phone. I would think they will be useful to people with larger hands since it makes it much easier to see the screen.

This stylus comes in two colors, black and white, which are both included in the package. The top of the stylus is the clicker, which moves the microfiber in or out. This is a really good feature, as you are able to keep your tip protected from damage. Under the clicker is the pocket protector holder, and at the end is the Microfiber tip. Unlike the New Trent Limir, the pocket protector for this product doesn&#8217;t detract to any feature of the stylus, and the body is one piece instead of two. This creates a better feel as a stylus. The biggest draw to buy this product is the microfiber tip, which is supposed to be compatible with any capacitive touch surface. Capacitive touch surfaces are a newer technology, which replaces resistive touch, a technology used by first generation touch screens and sub $50 mobile devices. Now, you may be thinking, &#8220;Don&#8217;t all styluses have this functionality?&#8221; The simple answer is, &#8220;No.&#8221; There are several companies that create cheaper styluses, with rubber tips, which are less responsive and not compatible with every capacitive touch screen. Overall, I like the construction of this stylus, and the microfiber tip.&#9654; TestingI tested the stylus with my Nexus 7 (2013), Samsung Galaxy Rush, Nintendo 3DS, and Zune HD. As expected, the stylus worked on every screen I attempted to use it with, unlike the rubber tip styluses I&#8217;ve used in the past. When I opened a drawing app on each device, the stylus was very comfortable and accurate to the touch. I actually prefer the feel of this stylus over the New Trent Limir, which is a stylus pen, because of it being one piece. I was satisfied by the results of this stylus.&#9654; Final ThoughtsI overall like the functions of this device, as the tip is retractable to avoid damage. I was able to successfully use this stylus with every device, which matches the claims. Because of the functionality of the stylus, I recommend this product to anyone who needs a stylus and give this product a 5 star rating.Pros:+ A very well built stylus pen, comfortable, and tested well with all my products.+ Compatible with all capacitive touch screens.Cons:I have no cons for this device.Sensitivity: 5/5Drag ability: 5/5Flexibility: 5/5Comfort: 5/5</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review327" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-22:</strong> I have needed a stylus so that I can keep up with note taking on my iPad Mini Retina.

When I started using the NT63T Stylus I was not sure how much I would miss the built-in ink pen in the top of the LIMIR Stylus. Although I did find myself occasionally trying to twist the Stylus to extend the ink pen this occurred only a few times. What I did discovered thought is that rather than missing the ink pen on the Stylus I appreciated more two of the features on the NT63T that were different from the LIMIR. The Capacitive Mesh Tip on the LIMIR Stylus is slightly larger than the Mesh Tip on the NT63T Stylus and the LIMIR Mesh Tip does not retract into the body of the Stylus as it does on the NT63T Stylus.While these differences are relatively minor they may be a plus in certain settings and/or for certain users.&#8226; The smaller mesh tip on the NT63T Stylus may make it slightly easier for users with large hands and/or fingers to choose smaller keys and/or options on the capacitive screen (especially the smaller smart phone screens).&#8226; The retractable mesh should make it easier to keep the capacitive mesh cleaner and drier when you are using the Stylus in harsher environments where dirt and/or moisture may be a concern.As with the NewTrent LIMIR Stylus, extensive use of the NT63T Stylus significantly reduces the need to clean the streaks and smudges that fingers invariably leave on our touch screen devices.With NewTrent the user is able to select the features and styles that work best for their individual needs. Either the NT63T Stylus with a smaller retractable mesh head or the LIMIR Stylus with a slightly larger mess stylus head that does not retract but instead includes an ink pen in the head of the Stylus. Regardless of their choice, the user will receive an excellent Capacitive Screen Stylus that is easy to use on all of their Capacitive Touch Screen Devices that will significantly reduce the finger prints and smudges common on all Capacitive Screens.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review332" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-31:</strong> These stylus pens work great.  The woven tip slides effortlessly across the screen and is very accurate.  The retractable tip is a great feature as it keeps the tip protected and clean.

Both my Note 2 and Note 3 came with a stylus (S-pen), and I rarely ever use it because i didn't like the way it felt gliding across the screen.  The felt tip is superior to the hard plastic tip of the S-pen or the rubber tip of some other styluses that I have used.  The stylus is also a good weight, not too light, not too heavy.  The diameter is about the size of a regular pen.  The diameter and weight makes it feel pleasant in my hand, unlike the S-pen which feels kinda light and flimsy.  It also has a clip which allows you to clip it to your shirt or pant pocket, which is a nice feature that some other stylus does not have.  The retractable feature is very nice as well, as I don&#8217;t want the tip to be damaged by keys when I put the stylus in my pocket.  It also does not cause any scratches or marks on the screen.One thing to keep in mind, if you are using this as a replacement for your s-pen, is that it does not have some S-pen functionality.  The Note 3 will treat it like you are using your finger.  Which is fine as this isn't marketed as an s-pen replacement, and priced way less as well.  This isn't an issue on any tablet or phone that doesn't come with a stylus.  In fact, it has the added benefit because with your finger or the New Trent stylus, you can hover over web pages to magnify, which is pretty handy for me.  This is not an option with the s-pen on the web browser.  For e-mails, both the S-pen and New Trent stylus can show the preview window, but I prefer using the New Trent stylus because it works much better.  Using the S-pen is finicky for e-mail previews as you have to hold it at the right distance from the screen or it won't show the preview.As for usage on my iPad, it works well too, allowing easy scrolling in e-mail or web pages.  I prefer to use the stylus over my finger as it feels easier and smoother.  It works fine pushing any of the buttons on the screen as well.Overall I am pleased with this stylus and would recommend it to others.  I have used other stylus but never happy with them.  I can honestly say that I would be using the stylus now much more frequently now that I found this stylus.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review335" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-22:</strong> I love how the woven ends seem a lot more sturdy than the usual rubber ones that you find in pretty much every other styluses.  It's a good size, and comes in a dual pack.  I don't really need two of them, but for the price, I'd probably even pay for one.  These are so far one of the better quality styluses (stylii?) that I've ever had the pleasure of having in my hands.I haven't tried drawing with this on an iPad yet, but the way it's looking, I think note-taking and drawing can actually be accomplished with this 2-for-1 deal.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review336" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-28:</strong> I loved these, and getting 2 for this price was fabulous.

The only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating is because of the clip, for I phone there is no where to &#34;clip&#34; it to, so winds up being another gadget to get lost, but you get two so that is a plus.

It has a smooth glossy finish that feels nice in your hands. The tip of the stylus is not your typical conductive rubber tip. It's almost like iron wool woven into a round tip that collapses to adjust to the pressure being applied to it. It slides incredibly smoothly across the screen of the device like a paint brush. It is 100% harmless to your device. Since it slides so nicely across the device you don't need a grip for the stylus. The design is nice and you can click the tip in and out so it gives you a pen kind of feel. This would be very useful for tablets in business. It would work well in an office or hospital situation that has a high tech workplace. Or it's nice for the digital artist.

Where the first one had a rubber tip, this one has a mesh fiber tip as well as a metal spring inside (which you can hear when you depress the pen tip... a little annoying). I found that you need to keep the pen closer to a 90 degree angle when pressing down. If you held the pen casually, at an angle, the ipad definitely had a harder time tracking where you were. Neither stylus I've used was anywhere as good as your finger as far as screen sensitivity goes. That said, if you do a lot of precision clicking (e.g. clicking on a one character long URL) or use a handwriting app, this stylus will get the job done.One thing I really liked about this particular model though is that it has a retractable tip and a pen clip - very handy if you use it a lot and want to keep it in your pocket for easy access.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review343" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-30:</strong> I am a teacher and use an iPad nearly all day to teach my class.

I mostly use the Boxwave stylus, so this is more of a comparison. Both this Trent Arcadia stylus and the Boxwave glide real easy and provide great response . The Boxwave tip, however, is slightly more firm than the Arcadia. I personally like the firmer tip so I gave 4 stars to the Trent Arcadia.

The tip, despite being soft feels slightly scratchy, making me reluctant to use it on a screen without a screen protector. It's probably completely fine (and I haven't seen any scratching), but it just doesn't give me a great feeling.2. The response from the touchscreen is somewhat hit or miss. I tried it on a Moto X, an iPad 2 and an iPad 3. The stylus worked equally well on all products, which is to say it worked ~90% of the time. This is fine, but like every passive stylus i've used, it's just not good enough to really draw well (you keep having to go back and redo points that are missed).

With it being able to click in and out, it does not get dirty and rubbed away being in a pocket so that is a great function.Overall this is a great stylus pack and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great Stylus pen.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review350" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-16:</strong> These are really nice but I think the mesh gives my Phablet mixed signals when trying to scroll.

It's slightly longer than my index finger, so it took some getting used to. It's slightly shorter than one of those government issue retractable Skilcraft pens, maybe 1/2 inch.These have been great. The only possible downside I have is that they may not be durable enough for kids. I gave one to my 6 year old to use on her iPod and one side of the knit came loose. I sort of effected a repair, but it doesn't retract anymore, which isn't a big deal for her. I didn't inspect it so I don't know if it was defective or her being destructive, but the latter is highly likely. The one I have been using shows no sign of wear and has held up fine under normal adult use.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review356" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-04:</strong> Best stylus I&#8217;ve used thus far.

This is the best tip for all touch screen devices.  There is no drag, no scratching, no squeaking, and no streaking, as rubber tips can do when they start to wear. I use a touchscreen Samsung Galaxy 7&#8221; tablet for work, and my documentation for all of my work is on this device, so I use a stylus constantly.  I also have a Kindle Fire, an iPhone 5, and an Ipod Touch, as well as a Pantech touchscreen phone.The clickpen that allows the tip to be protected from excessive dirt and spills by retracting it into the body of the stylus is a wonderful feature.  It will allow for even longer wear. It&#8217;s a great value for the price.The con, if it&#8217;s indeed a con, is that there is no pen with this pen.

The stylus has enough weight to it that it won't get lost among every other pen in my bag or pack.  The stylus has a stong click which I like (it doesn't feel like it's going to fall apart when using it).  The tip of the stylus is a soft capacitive material that gives when pushed on the screen.  Other styluses can be rubber, plastic, or metal and I enjoy having the softer touch on my electronic screens.  The stylus is shorter than others on the market.  However, this doesn't really take away from the product in my opinion because it needs to be small enough for me to want to carry everywhere with my devices.Effectiveness:  This particular stylus works great for capacitive touchscreens devices such as the iPad Air, iPhone 4, and iPhone 5.  The stylus's soft touch makes me feel better about using on my electronic devices.  The screens responded well when using the stylus.  I can't say I have too many complaints with this stylus.

The very high quality tip is what makes this product so good.The stylus market is very competitive, with many different sizes and features. I am so glad I came across the New Trent Stylus. The Durability of this stylus is something I have never seen in any other stylus. A common trend that I have seen with past styluses is they work great for a month or two and then the tip breaks. By the end of the year I have gone through numerous styluses and spent too much money. The New Trent Stylus is a different story. I have tried to break the tip and I was not successful. I can see this lasting much, much longer than a few months.The tip is surprisingly easy to use. I am able to click on small print easier with the stylus than with my finger. Plus the stylus is small. There is no reason to have a big stylus and the big styluses are harder for people to bring with them. Even my wife can fit this stylus in her small jeans pocket and use it on her phone while on the go. The black and white looks very professional as it will match the apple devices and the stylus is made out of metal. I would suggest having more color options though.An issue that I have with other styluses is that they have a dual function of being a pen too. This can get in the way and becomes a pain when the ink runs out of the pen. I work in the medical field and go through a pen a week and so I love that the New Trent stylus has focused on what it is made for. The simplicity makes for a reliable stylus.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review363" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-04:</strong> Rating is definitely a 5 for both design and usefulness. My only regret is that it lacks an ink pen option. This is the most responsive stylus I have used to date. I like that the tip retracts to be protected from damage in the pocket. The tip is so much more precise than a finger tip, and easier to control.

There's a plastic ring around the &#34;barrel&#34; which further keeps the stylus from scratching your screen - especially useful if you forget to click the button and expose the soft spongy tip.

Other than that, I am in no way associated with New Trent.These are nice little styli. I like the face that the soft tip is retractable - less damage that way. There is a clearish-white plastic ring around the part where the tip retracts, and I'm pretty sure that the plastic ring is meant to stay in place. Not sure what the function of that little part is...The retracting mechanism works as expected, and solidly. The pocket clip is hearty.The tip itself isn't the typical spongy material I've seen in more expensive styli. Instead, it seems to be woven microfiber cloth overlying some kind of spongy material. The microfiber seems to work really nicely. Tracking, pointing and dragging are all very accurate.The ONLY MINOR issue I have with these is the length, as other reviewers have noted. They're just a little short for me, but I have BIG hands. If any of you work in an OR, like I do, I take a size 9 glove - that's big. Pianists: I can easily do an octave and a third.

This fit the bill. It still has all of the smoothness I expect from this type of stylus and I no longer need to worry as much about sticking it in my pocket. The only reason I took off one star was because the white stylus rattles when I write with it which is a bit annoying.

The size is perfect for portability as well as utilization and the Micro-Knit system is precise in selecting as well as fluent in across screen movement.  It literally becomes part of you and makes on-screen typing and selecting more efficient and effective.  I appreciate the click-ability to retract the Micro-Knit tip so that it can be preserved from damage, dirt, and grime which in turn protects my touchscreen and prolongs the life of my stylus.  The clip ensures it can safely rest in my pocket with the rest of my writing utensils.  I'm very grateful for the soft plastic protective casing on the tip of the stylus which prevents damage to the touchscreen if by chance you forget to click out the Micro-Knit.  The low price includes a black and white stylus and the quality and effectiveness made me instantly buy two more and to stop looking for "the perfect stylus".  I have finally found it.

What I found with this stylus was a welcome find. For the price, this stylus out did some of the $30, and $40 ones out there. Before this one I had settled on the Griffin stylus with a rubber end, it seemed to work best and was a good price. However this New Trent stylus uses a micro-knit end that is capacitive and this really improved the quality of apps where you write or draw free hand. It was much more precise then a rubber ended stylus. Being retractable is a plus, this keeps the end in good shape when not in use.I tested this on a Kindle Fire, Toshiba Thrive, HP Touchpad, Ipad 2 and 3, and Iphone4. It worked well on all, best on the iOS devices, worst on the HP Touchpad with WebOS.I mainly use my iPad, and the app notability to take free hand notes. As I mentioned this micro-knit end improved my free hand notes a lot!I also generally use a stylus to just maneuver on a tablet to reduce finger prints on the screen, I was able to navigate all my devices, (screen swipes, app selection, etc) without issue.Don't spend big $$ on a rubber ended stylus when you can get this micro-knit ended one at a better price! It does make a difference.

They're adequate if all you want to do is write an occasional short note, but if you want to draw, they stick to the glass and change the feel of your pen-strokes. They also make it harder to get meaningful effects from pressure variations in programs like 53's iPad app, Paper.These Styli solve those problems. As in, "yee-hah! Solved them!"The metal mesh tip glides over the surface, works well from angles that aren't the perpendicular (straight up and down for those of you who failed geometry) and allow line-weight variation while sketching by varying the speed and pressure of your strokes. Your handwriting with one of them can be absolutely gorgeous, as good and disciplined as paper once you get used to the near absence of tactile feedback.In terms of its physical design, there are some who don't like the size of them but that is a matter of taste and technique.People with larger hands may find themselves touching the stylus to the screen and having their hand touch another point. Using one of them is, in some ways, like using a pencil stub, but that small problem is compensated for by the stylus's small size and retractability. Since the tip retracts like a pen, you can carry it in your pocket like a ball-point and that makes up "I've-got-these-meat-hooks-for-hands" factor.Here's the summary:1. It writes and draws incredibly well.2. The price is amazing (you get a package of two for a third to a quarter of their original list price.)3. It retracts, making it a sort of eternal ball-point pen for your tablet/kindle/iPad/etc.It's main bad point: You have to watch it like a hawk. if you hand it to someone and let them try it, the kind of people who robo-pockect your pens and lighters will walk away with it.I think every good person who can have one of these should. As a matter of principle, I only give five stars when the product is not just good, but good, undeniably good and surprising. *These* styli get five stars.Don't think this is a rave review. Be sure. It is one.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review380" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-17:</strong> The package arrived with two stylus, one black and one white.  The first thing I noticed about the stylus was the weight.  The weight seems perfect to me. Its not too heavy and not too light, it just feels solid in your hand and not cheap etc. The second thing that I noticed was that the microfiber tip is smaller than than most of the other microfiber stylus out there.  I consider others in the large category, so I would put this tip in the medium sized category.  The tip is smooth and glides effortlessly across my iPad mini and the size of the tip seems to make it write better and do more fine tuned functions than other fatter tipped stylus.  The big plus is that the tip is retractable which helps prevent it from getting damaged when not using it and the spring that controls that doesn't seem cheap.Overall I would give this stylus a 5 out of 5.

The design is nearly flawless and I love the fact that there is a clip in them so that you can clip them to a tablet case.  The fact that you have click them in order to expose the pen is even better.  This eliminates any unnecessary wear and tear to the tip of the stylus pen.  As for the tip...The fabric and material used to create the tip is pretty neat.  It looks like it's made from metallic materials but it feels extremely soft to the touch.  This eased my mind considerably since I thought that the tip may end up scratching my screen.  I can tell you now, my friends, these sytlus pens will not!  That also speaks volumes for it's durability.  I've only owned the stylus pens for a few weeks, but I have yet to see ANY type of wear or tear to the tips.A stylus is perfect for tablet gaming and makes browsing the internet a breeze.  You can kiss accidental clicking goodbye once you own these great stylus pens.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review385" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-21:</strong> When I received the NT63T I was pleasantly surprised by how well the product was made. At first I wasn&#8217;t sure the reason to have the &#8220;pen-like&#8221; feature for a stylus, but after using it for a day so far and realizing how the pad could get messed up just tossing the stylus in my pocket, I realized how great of an idea it was. The product works very nicely with my Samsung S5 as well as my Microsoft Surface and my Ipad. I have been able to go between devices without a problem and the stylus allows me to interact with my touchscreens easier and faster. As far as a stylus goes I would give this a 5/5. It is truly the best made, most usable stylus I have ever used. I would recommend this product to anyone who has to use multiple devices that have different types of touchscreens. My son (4 years old) was able to use the stylus pretty easily as well to play his educational games on my wife&#8217;s ipad. It made it easier for him and we didn&#8217;t have to worry about his hands being dirty and then clean off the screen later. We also have screen protectors on all of our devices and the stylus worked without a problem with them.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review386" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-07:</strong> I have always wanted to try out a stylus on my tablet (nexus 10) and I am glad this is the one I tried.

The stylus itself is very well made.

I also own a Griffin stylus, but wanted to see whether the New Trent's "micro-knit technology" is better.USABILITYNew Trent's pen has a micro-knit tip, whereas Griffin's is a rubber one. What I instantly liked about Griffin's is that the tip can be retracted through its clipper (just like a normal pen.) This provides protection for the tip during transport, a concern I have since the micro-knit is a fiber. I am not sure how the New Trent tip would hold up if it gets snagged against a sharp object (like a sweater getting stuck on a piece of metal fence.) I'd imagine that it'd probably fall apart just like the sweater would. However, the pen would likely last longer than Griffin's rubber one if I accidentally left both in the car on a hot summer day: the rubber would likely dry up and eventually crack.I am not sure what that white, see-through, removable plastic cover at the tip is for (see product photo). There is no manual that comes with it. The only guesses I have are: (1) better looks or (2) ability to use the pen on resistive touch screens where you have to push down on the screen. If the latter is true, then this pen has a dual purpose compared to Griffin's rubber: ability to be used on capacitive and resistive touch screens.The box that the New Trent came with shows that the pen is for iPad/iPhone/iPod Touch, but in my testing, it has worked with any capacitive touch device I have used, including HTC Incredible and Samsung Galaxy SII smartphones. It also worked with the capacitive buttons.Both pens feel very good in the hand and make drawing on my iPad and Asus Transformer Prime a joy to use. They are both much more accurate than using your finger. However, Griffin's rubber tip doesn't glide as smoothly as New Trent's.LOOKSThe Griffin stylus has a matted finish, whereas New Trent is glossy. Both are roughly the same size and the same weight. What I like about Griffin is the small hole at the opposite end of the tip, allowing you to hook a lanyard to wear around your neck. I do also like Griffin's logo on the side of the pen -- the New Trent strangely has no logo. Some may find that as a plus, but I'd like to be reminded which product I purchased in case I wanted to buy another in the future.New Trent's pen can possibly be made smaller by making the clipper (used to push the tip out of the pen) shorter. This could appeal to those who prefer their items to be as small as possible.OVERALLI like both pens, but in the end, I like the New Trent's ability to retract the micro-knit tip (for protection), the possibility of using it for resistive screens, and that it glides smoother than Griffin's rubber tip. If New Trent could shorten the clipper to shrink the size of the pen, add New Trent's logo to the side (like Griffin), and possibly add a way to attach a lanyard for carrying around the neck, this product would be even better.I still wish I knew what that see-through, removable plastic at the tip is for.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review393" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-10:</strong> These stylus' work awesome.

In addition to these New Trent styluses, I also bought a TruGlide Stylus with Microfiber Tip by LYNKtec and a BoxWave EverTouch Capacitive Stylus. I like the New Trent styluses the best. They work well (on my 3rd gen iPad) with little pressure; the tip is firm and the size is good, and I like that I can retract the tip when it is not in use. I don't have huge hands, but my hands are longer and bigger than most women's and I can hold this stylus comfortably, although it is shorter than most pens. It has a nice heft to it, comparable to a quality ballpoint pen. It's a great value as well. At least right now, you couldn't buy two TruGlide styluses or even two BoxWave ones at a price this low.Why I won't be using the TruGlide Stylus: besides being so light it felt cheap, the microfiber tip is not as firm and I had to push down harder with it to get a response, squishing the tip. Also, there is no way to protect the tip. The first time I used it, the BoxWave EverTouch Capacitive Stylus produced an irritating, high-pitched squeak with every stroke across the screen. Thankfully, that stopped in time. There is no way to protect the tip of the BoxWave stylus either, but that may be a non-issue after all. The New Trent styluses are still a much better value, in my opinion.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review397" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-15:</strong> This is my Review on the New Trent Arcadia 2PCS Micro-Knit "Clickpen" Stylus. In the last couple months I've had a chance to try out several different kinds of Styluses. I've tried pretty much all of them, from the cheap 10 pack of twist pen rubber tip/nib all the way up to the Executive Combination Ink Pen Stylus. Most of which were the rubber tip/nib kind and were too big for my liking. I use a stylus on my Samsung Galaxy S3 and a smaller sized tip works best for me. The larger tipped Stylus Would most likely work better for Tablets. I've found that the rubber tip/nib kind had a kind of sticky like drag feel to them and the tips would wear out or tear very easily. The newest style tip/nib is the "Fiber Mesh Tip/Nib" and I've found this style to be better than the rubber because of the way it glides effortlessly across the screen, no drag, no stickiness at all, it also seems to be more reactive to the screen than the rubber, and it lasts much longer. The ones I've been using are not showing any wear whatsoever after a month of constant use. Now when I came across the New Trent Micro-Knit "Clickpen" Stylus I wasn't too sure about how much I was going to like it. The Tip/Nib size was my biggest concern as it has been whenever I've ordered any and all of the Stylus that I've bought in the last couple months. In my experiences It's very difficult to tell how big or small the size of these tips/nibs are from the pictures that are shown unless it has something else in the photo to compare it to. When I received the New Trent Arcadia TwinPack I was pleasantly surprised to find them both in a convenient clear plastic carrying case. The tip/nib is nice and small, immediately I could tell these were made out of metal because of the weight, a big plus in my eyes. The shirt pocket clip was also metal, another big plus. As far as I can tell almost everything is made out of metal and other quality materials. The Stylus is a shorter style, about 4  inches long maybe 5 with the nib out. Which is the only thing I would change about it. I have big hands and I've found that a longer Stylus feels better in my hand than the shorter style. The click mechanism works flawlessly every time. This I think is a great feature due to the fact that I keep the Stylus in my pocket when I'm not using it and with the Nib retracted it can't be damaged, another big plus. The last thing I would like to point out is the screen protector. When I bought this Stylus I didn't know it meant the Stylus had a protective tip around the Nib to keep the Stylus from scratching your screen. This is a huge plus because I've had several other Styli in the past scratch the screen or in my case the screen protector I had placed on my screen.Overall I really like the New Trent Micro-Knit Clickpen Stylus and I give it 4  Stars I would have given it a 5 if it were an inch longer. I have already recommended this Stylus to several of my friends and family and will continue to recommend it to anyone in the market for a quality Stylus. It's a great Stylus at a great price.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review398" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-01:</strong> The stylus works very well for note taking and simple drawing.  I used the Stylus with both Penultimate and Notability apps, and the micro knit tip responded very well.  It took some getting used to writing with this type of stylus, but after about one month of consistent use, I have switched nearly all of my business note taking to the iPad with the micro knit stylus.I like the retractable head on the stylus which I believe will preserve its functionality for a longer time vs. non-retractable head stylus.  The only quality I did not like was the length of the stylus because it did not feel as natural as a pen in my hands.  The size of the stylus might be adequate for those with smaller hands, but I found that after some longer note-taking sessions that it became increasingly uncomfortable.Overall, I liked using this product very much and the price point makes it very reasonable, and it is not a devastating scenario if it gets misplaced.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review399" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-02:</strong> The thing that impressed me the most about this unique stylus was how smoothly it moves across my iPad screen. I am using a screen protector over the glass surface and the silver mesh tip just slides across the surface compared to a rubber tip stylus, which drags on the surface.I find there is little difference in how hard you must tap the screen for the taps to register between the silver mesh tip and the rubber tip. I also like that the tip is retractable to protect the tip. I found the clip to be too stiff to attach the stylus to anything.I love that, due to the design of the tip, I can use the New Trent Stylus at a shallower angle to the screen than with the rubber tipped stylus. This allows me to write using the same angle I use with pen and paper.I would definitely recommend this stylus.New Trent IMP63B Stylus/Styli Touch Screen Cell phone Tablet Pen with Micro-Knit Technology Capacitive Stylus for iPhone 4 4s iPod touch iPad 2 Samsung Galaxy Motorola Xoom Blackberry Playbook, Barnes and Noble Nook (Black Color)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review400" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-17:</strong> They came in a plain yellow unpadded envelope, two pens (one white and one black) in a plastic sleeve that has a fold-over flap.Simply put, it works.  Instead of using your finger, you just use the stylus.  Both of them worked the same way a regular click pen works:  there&#8217;s a &#8220;button&#8221; (I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a name for this!) at the top of the pen that you push, and the tip comes out.  It&#8217;s a &#8220;micro-knit tip&#8221; that&#8217;s quite soft, and you can use it instead of using your finger.I tried it on a Sony Xperia tablet, and I was able to read a book with it &#8211; i.e., use the pen to turn the page, click on different buttons, etc.  I don&#8217;t know why anyone would want to do it this way, but it can be done.  I also used it on a Swype &#8482; keyboard.  It was hit and miss with this, but I think it had more to do with the app than with the pen, as I encountered the same issues when I used my finger.I also used this on my Samsung Note 3 phone and Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 tablet, and it worked well on both of them.  The best part of this pen is when I used it to write notes.  It functions just like a &#8220;real&#8221; pen, and it did work better than using my finger.  Now, of course, the Note (both phone and tablet) comes with its own stylus, and this is where the Arcadia stylus falls short.  The stylus from Samsung has a button towards the tip that allows you to perform other functions.  The Arcadia stylus is just a pen, a replacement for using your finger, not a replacement for the stylus.  The good part about the Arcadia is that, as a pen, it is much better than the tiny stylus from Samsung.The stylus also works on the Nintendo DS.The only suggestion I have for making this better would be to replicate the button controller that the Note devices have.  However, that probably will take a major re-design, as it appears the Note stylus is also an infrared device, as it doesn&#8217;t require the tip to actually touch the screen for the controller to work.Overall, the stylus works great if you do a lot of pen work.  Otherwise, it&#8217;s just a novelty.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review401" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-27:</strong> The New Trent Arcadia IMP63T/NT63T is noticeably heavier and more substantial feeling than another, generic rubber-tip stylus I own.

Working on a small screen is tough enough, but dealing with the "frictive-drag" of ZAGG's "rubbery" surface. I went through more styli before finding the rubber-nib is NOT the ideal for drawing/writing (in my experience)on ZAGG. The Micro-Fiber tip is far-and-away a better device. Interestingly...if you're without micro-fiber styli, just rubber-nib, a "touch" of silicon lubricant - the kind used with sexual toys (can be bought in small squeeze packets - but you, or someone has to go into adult store to buy...smile) cuts the "stutter" of the dry surface and allows fora smoother drawing experience. Just a smidgen...and wiped thoroughly all over screen. I found my micro-fiber tipped styli on Amazon, with retractable click tips no less, at great price: [...]. Hope this helps with drawing games and interacting with your phone/tablet in most civilized manner.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review412" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-09:</strong> The New Trent stylus pen (NT63T) is well made and works great! The pen is comfortable to hold--has a nice solid feel to it. The micro fiber tip glides across the surface of my tablet, iPad, Samsung phone, and Kindle. It works better than my finger! I like that it's retractable, so that it's protected when I toss it into my purse.I'm glad it's a  twin pack, because my 3 year old decided he wanted one for himself to use on the tablet to play games and navigate YouTube. He has no problems using it--and being that he's hard on things, it's doing great! I'm also grateful for the plastic collar that protects the tablet--should he attempt to use it while the tip is retracted.

The build quality is about what I expected due to the price.  I have not had any issues with the stylus at all with build quality.  It gets the job done.  The retractable function works like any other retractable pen that people are used to.  Accuracy is ok.  It's not uncommon for the stylus not to be recognized by the touchscreen sometimes.  I found that I needed to make sure to press down a little bit to squish the micro-knit  nub in order to be sure that the stylus would be recognized.  I have not noticed that the stylus scratches up the screen or anything like that.  It seems to be safe to use on your touchscreen device without worry.The "squishy" nub on the end of the stylus will be a personal preference on whether you like it or not.  I personally wanted something with a little less give to it, but I could see people being perfectly happy with it.  I also feel like the stylus could be a little longer.  Here are the pros and cons from my usage so far.Pros:- Price- Retractable tip- It works pretty well- Does not damage the screenCons:- The total length is a little short for my liking- The touchscreen has some issues recognizing the stylus- The nub is a little too squishy</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review419" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-02:</strong> This is a good stylus.

I used this on my iPhone 5 and iPad mini extensively, in all aspects. Texting, browsing, emailing, games and various apps. It does very well for the large gestures. I'd say it is above average for finer touch moments, close to perfect. I'd like to see if a more fine-tip stylus can fill that final void (it may not, I'm not really sure).

I am a high school teacher in a 1:1 iPad school so my stylus gets a workout daily.  I currently have several students using this stylus as well.  The one amazing thing that separates this stylus from other mesh tip styli is the retractability of the tip.  For high school students, this is a big highlight as they can throw it in a bag or pocket without worry of damaging the tip.  The tip is smooth in gliding over the iPad screens with very little delay compared to the rubber tip stylus.  We have been using these for approximately a month with zero problems.  This mesh tip is a little softer than other mesh tip styli on the market, but I do not notice much of a difference and the feature mentioned above more than makes up for it.  The price cannot be beat for this feature.  If you are hard on a stylus or simply looking to try something new, this is the stylus for you.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review425" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-19:</strong> I think this is a great stylus.

The plastic cap around the bottom of the pen keeps it from scratching the screen if I forget that I have the stylus clicked off. The micro knit is much better than the rubber stylus I have had. The micro knit slides very nicely on the screen and is sensitive enough for tiny links. The only con I can think of is that the stylus might be a little short for some people.

Mt wife will use the other one with her iPhone, also with a little screen.

I bought all the cheap ones, the more expensive ones at the cell phone stores, Walmart, Radio Shack, Target, etc. I ended up getting rid of all those and never looked back. I've had these for a year now. I lost the white one when we moved a few months ago, but I used them regularly on my Ipad2, Samsung Galaxy S4, HTC One, HTC Incredible, IPhone 4 and 5, and a Knook color. It worked flawlessly the whole time. I love that they are a bit heavier than the other hollow stylus that I tried, and the microfiber tips are extremely durable. My toddler who just turned 2 has gotten ahold of it dozens of times and &#34;drew&#34; on the walls, floor, her LeapPad, etc. It's even been chewed on and it seems fine. I've started noticing in the black one at the very tip there's what looks like a tiny hair sticking out, it must be a small fiber that's fraying. Again, this is after tons of use on several different screens, being roughly handled by a small child and being a year old. The retractable feature is wonderful so you can put it in your pocket and not worry that its rubbing up against something or the fiber material will get snagged on something and it keeps it clean. This is by far the best price I've ever seen for a stylus of this quality. The plastic guards that are shown at the tips in the photo do come off. I'm not sure if people just didn't know or if they never tried it, but they are removable and their removal causes no impact to the use or look of the stylus. I prefer it not on them just because it looks a bit prettier. I'm actually thinking I'm going to buy a few more of these sets and give a couple as Christmas presents to friends and family who love mine. Honestly the size, shape, weight, color, materials, durability, etc... It's all top-notch. If you're looking for a wonderful daily use stylus for a great price, look no further.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review428" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-24:</strong> These work great.

For the past couple years I have used my Ipad exclusively for taking notes at work.  I was going through the cheap Best Buy styluses very quickly until based on a recommendation I bought the Bamboo one.  I have been using it for a year or so.  It has a nice weight and you can replace the tips.  I just never really liked the rubber tips, they don't glide naturally.  I bought these because the tips look like they would glide better and I was right.  This is much easier to write with, it glides smoothly over the screen and feels much more natural. I like that the tip retracts.  My stylus spends a lot of time in my pants pocket which further wears stylus tips.I am a little disappointed in the stylus itself.  The pictures don't accurately represent the size.  Its shorter than a standard pen and shorter than the Bamboo which took some getting used to.  It just doesn't feel as natural as it would if it was the same length as a normal pen.  The build quality seems cheaper than I would like and there is no weight to it.  The tip also seems a little flimsier than it needs to be which might make it susceptible to bending or breaking off.  Time will tell if this is indeed more durable than what I have been using.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007FXMOV8" id="B007FXMOV8-review430" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-09:</strong> This stylus works great.

Maybe it works better if you don't have a screen protector but I think most people probably do, so that they can protect their investment. I bet you this would be great if underneath the Micro-Knit there was a rubber tip like on a regular stylus.

The feel of the Micro-Knit tip is probably much more comfortable than standard rubber (which I imagine drags across the screen).As I said it worked perfectly with my iPhone 4s and the new iPad -- However, my girlfriend had a slightly less desirable experience with her Samsung Galaxy S II. She said the screen is not as responsive -- perhaps the soft tip doesn't register with it.Also -- some people mention this being "flimsy" ... I call it light weight. It is extremely durable, and who needs extra weight in their pocket? I also will mention it has a great "click" to it...

They are also quite good at blocking out outside noise. I cannot hear any 1 when these are completely in and I am rocking some tunes.Also the button on this can pause music one click and 2 successive quick clicks is used to skip to the next track. 1 click to answer a call.

I really needed something decent that I could toss in my bag. Good quality, but cheap enough that I don't mind if they get a little beat up. Something better than the crappy ones that my iPhone came with.These are the headphones for that situation.The sound quality, while obviously not comparable to more expensive sets, still gives a lot more definition than what you would expect from similar priced ones. Nice and crisp, but lacking slightly in the "lows".The silicone ear cups do a really good job at isolating (not eliminating) external sounds. So good in fact, that I wouldn't recommend having both buds in while taking a call and driving.The only complaint I have with these is that the cord does tend to get tangled. I'd love it if they had a cloth cord, but again, that kind of option usually comes on a higher priced set.Pros: Good quality sound for a lower priced set. Good sound isolation.Cons: Prone to tangles. Lacking slightly in the bass department.Bottom Line: The price point these retail at is really crowded. These should defiantly stand out with better than average sound, good noise isolation, and quality construction.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0049Y2PIS" id="B0049Y2PIS-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-23:</strong> The first two of these I received didn't work (well, the controller switch didn't work).

I ONLY talk using headset (hate the bluetooth thing - poor sound and you have to speak too loud)... the headset was clear and everyone I talked to could hear me clearly.  The sound was good for playing music.  I basically have the earbud in constantly for either music or taking/placing calls.  Note that this type of earbud is better for listening to music than taking calls as the "in ear" rubber type tend to seal out exterior noise (great for blocking out and listening to music - but not so perfect for placing calls as you get that hollow "I can hear myself in a tin can" and you speak louder than necessary because you can't hear yourself as well... The regular ear buds without the "suction cups" are better for making calls so I have a set of those too if I know I am going to be placing calls or need to "hear" my surrounding environment better.  Overall a good purchase.  I keep several on hand incase I lose a pair or inevitably I get the cord caught on something and pull it apart... these have actually done quite well in not breaking I(many tend to lose sound in one ear of the other due to just the physical abuse I put them under)...</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0049Y2PIS" id="B0049Y2PIS-review32" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-14:</strong> these earbuds are amazing, very clear and comfortable.

That was a problem I didn't have with the battery that came with my phone. After about two weeks the charger has a light that when charging a low battery is red and when fully charged turns blue. When I put in a low battery the light would be blue and never charge my phone. I called Amazon to get a replacement and they could only refund my money which was fine. It was quick and easy to get my refund. I decided just to go to Sprint and get their charger that comes with only one extra battery for about $20 more.On the upside it charges the Evo battery as well as the Evo3D.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0058BAJOS" id="B0058BAJOS-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-12-30:</strong> Great Battery, Triple my battery life vs even the Original Battery!

I purchased these batteries based on the reviews of others. I have to say I am very satisfied so far. The day they arrived I charged them up with the charger it came with. I believe someone else stated that it takes longer than 4 hrs to charge like the original. It's true, so I was prepared to wait a while before they were fully charged (the light has to be blue). I wanted to wait until my original Evo 3d battery was drained before I used the new battery. The next day I placed it in my phone at 5pm. At  9:53 pm my battery was still pretty much full (around 95%) after normal use (talking, music, email, surfing internet, and playing games).  This battery is a must have. The price for two of these is much less than the price for 1 of the standard batteries through Sprint, $44.99. I think for me this is better than getting the extended battery which makes the phone bulkier than what it is.  No exaggeration, you cannot go wrong with this battery. I even purchased the Evo 4g battery for someone else because it just makes sense LOL.  I had to learn the hard way, not to buy accessories from any wireless carrier store. Actually, Amazon is the place where I get most of my accessories for other electronics. I just might order some more just to stock up on them at this price. You can never have too many batteries IMO. :-,)Battery Life 1day 2h 12m  7:16pmPlaced other battery in and my battery meter said 97% so I turned my phone off and plugged it up to give it a full charge. It took an 1/12 before it got the full charge, 100% 8:38 pmI wanted to add that I did use some battery saving tips: Cut off wifi, 4g, bluetooth and gps when not needed. Lessen the brightness of the screen. No Live Wallpaper.After using these batteries for a few days, I decided to try the stock one again. I had to keep the battery on charge more than I did with the Chichitec battery.These batteries does exactly as described.Longer Life.Thanks :)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0058BAJOS" id="B0058BAJOS-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-29:</strong> good battery but not the best. it lasts much longer than original battery. after 6-7 months one of the two battery get voltage drops another works fine.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0058BAJOS" id="B0058BAJOS-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-10-29:</strong> This product saved the day for me.

I've been installing custom roms for as long as I can remember.  By the way, if you have never heard of xda developers, you should check them out.  (google it).  Anyway, enough qualifying myself.  I can confirm, these batteries do last longer than stock.  I can usually go one full day on the oem battery, and I'll end up with around 30% by the time the day is over.  With these, I'm ending up with around 50-60% at the end of the day.  Great batteries, and it comes with two.  The charger it comes with works just fine, don't worry about the review of it being made of crap.  It might be if you stomp on it or something, but works just great for me.

I am no expert so I can't be certain that it is exactly 1930 mAh, but from my experience, it outperforms my stock battery. My stock battery lasts about 1 work day, depending on use it will usually die anywhere from my commute home to at the very latest, when I am going to bed. I bought the phone used though, and I am not sure if the battery was properly broken in. After a week of deep cycling the Chichitec battery (completely charging and letting it completely die before charging again) the battery will last well over 24 hours. I am borderline on service at work, so it takes a fair amount of power for the phone to be switching between sprint 3G and roam 3G all day. If I had Sprint service in the office I'm sure the battery would last 2 days at a time. About the only complaint I have with the whole setup is how bright the LED is on the charger. I had to move it out of the bedroom because I like it dark when I sleep. Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase, I was torn between this and some cheaper options, but I am very glad I went with the other high reviews and bought this product.Edit: I have now used these batteries for 2 months and it is completely obvious when I use the stock battery because these batteries last so much longer. I am so glad I decided to take a chance on these batteries instead of the super-cheap ones or the bulky extended battery. These have enough power to make it through the day with moderate use and make it until I put it on the dock at night (unless I am doing something that kills the battery like watching movies.) I don't know why they don't put batteries like these in the phone stock, but I'm glad there is an option to add them. Keep up the good work Chichitec.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B0058BAJOS', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B0058BAJOS', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B004OA6VX2</h2>    <p class="price"> $B004OA6VX2</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004OA6VX2" id="B004OA6VX2-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-11-02:</strong> This mounting kit is very nice.  It cradles the phone very well and adjusts through a wide range of positions.  I really like this mount, but the item description is misleading because the cable that is included is useless for iPhone users.  The cable is a mini-USB connection and won't work with any Apple devices.Before you install this in your vehicle, check out the iLuv website for instructions, because there aren't any instructions in the package.  There is a QC code you can scan with your iPhone, but it only takes you to the iLuv website and not directly to the product support page.This mount includes a sturdy suction cup for glass mounting.  I chose not to use this, because the windshield on my pickup is so far from the driver's head.  That's OK, because I don't want anything obstructing my field of vision.  I also chose not to use the adhesive ring to mount it on my dashboard, because the texture on my dash wouldn't work well with the adhesive.But the mounting base fits perfectly into a cup holder.  My truck has four cup holders in the front seat, so I have some to spare.  The location is perfect for this mount.  I can't believe how much safer this is with the phone perched in the mount compared to just setting it on my center console where it can fall during panic stops.The cradle itself is very convenient.  It has padded foam bumpers on the sides and the sides squeeze in to grip your phone.  It won't move at all.  Then just push two buttons to quickly release the phone once you arrive at your destination.  Very nice.  My iPhone case is a little bulky, but that isn't a problem at all with this mount.I like this mount a lot.  I know I'm not exactly using it as designed, but that's OK.  I'm still perplexed and peeved that the cable isn't compatible.  Too bad they chose to market this to iPhone owners but didn't include the right cable.Other than that, I'm very happy with the device.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004OA6VX2" id="B004OA6VX2-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-10-27:</strong> Easy to install, very adjustable. The charger is tiny, but seems to work okay. My EVO 3D and my fiance's Nexus S were held in every possible position. Easy release for either the phone or for the entire unit from the windshield. The clamp is adjustable both in width and spread.There's some other disc included, but since there's no instructions, I will have to say is it might be for mounting the unit to the dash. But I like the phone to be up higher on the windshield.Recommended.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004OA6VX2" id="B004OA6VX2-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-12-08:</strong> I've spent quite a lot of time on this, and I've run into something strange.  The suction cup on this mount kit is larger than the old kit I had, and I can't find a flat spot on my car interior that's large enough for this to fit.I've got a 1995 Jeep Grand Cherokee.  I mention that because old Jeeps are fairly common, at least around here.  While there are a few smooth surfaces near the driver's seat, they're all just a bit too small.  The windshield is a good distance away, and while I could attach it to the windshield, if I put it off to the right, allowing me to see the road, I can't reach the phone.I even tried to put it into one of the cupholders, but the suction cup is too large.It comes with a mounting plate, but of course the plate is larger than the suction cup, so I don't have anywhere to put that, either.  The dash is curved and textured, so I don't expect it to stick there at all.It's now in the second vehicle and it works well there, but since that car is waiting for a part it might be a while until I can really try it out well.  The USB cable works with my Android.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004OA6VX2" id="B004OA6VX2-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-12-22:</strong> I was really excited to try this mount kit for my car...particularly because it includes a disc that lets you mount on various surfaces if your windshield is out of reach.

Even if just for GPS purposes, he would still have to look down to view it.  When I saw the iLuv Universal Windshield Mount Kit for Apple iPod Touch, iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, iPhone 3GS and Smart Phones offered on Amazon Vine, I thought this might be a good way to remedy that issue.  It hasn't stopped him from using the phone, but it places it in a much better position for heads-up viewing.  It's worked out perfectly...The installation was a breeze, and we had no problems getting it to stick onto the area where it should go.  His iPhone 4 dropped in with no hassles, and he's been using it ever since.  We also love the fact that you can easily charge the device while in the cradle using the provided power adapter that runs off the cigarette lighter.  Now when he hits the road to go referee hockey games, he has GPS and his own music to listen to.  I'm also able to send him text messages without fearing that he'll be looking into his lap to read or answer while driving.  He likes the convenience, I like the safety.  We both win.I think paying $32 is a small cost to feel more safe when he's out on the road. I may even go out and get one of my own for the other car.

I do think it could be a little more rigid but the softness does help with the shock protection. I also think it would be better with the screen protector built in, so it can have a solid strengthening piece at the base of the screen that goes all the way across. This would get rid of any of that flappiness on the sides. Incidentally, using this case with the included screen protector (and perhaps a black rubber band at the base of the screen) definitely makes me feel better about my phone's security =D.

In doors you really can&#8217;t notice the difference unless you are under florescent light. Also, this case has edges that stick out on all four corners to protect the phone in case of a drop. Those corners also have a second purpose which is to give the phone some elevation from whatever surface you lay the phone on, that&#8217;s a good thing especially for the screen. The bad is that I lay my phone on its back whenever it&#8217;s not in my pocket and those corners on the back of the case are already scratch up and I've only owned it for 4 days and my desk is a polished wood desk.

I've also used other cases on other phones, such as Otterbox Commuter (which I don't like for several reasons)The Samsung, Diztronic, and UAG are the only cases from above that I kept (and the Samsung was actually given to me).So - on to the review of the Ballistic Jewel:I'm a 32 year old male, and I usually like manly things (hence the UAG).  This case isn't "many" but it isn't "girly" either.  My wife said it best when she said that it's sort-of "unisex" - and due to how perfect this case is for me in every other regard, I'm absolutely ok with that.  With that said, could this case benefit from a "smoke" color?  Absolutely.  However, it may not be poplar enough yet to make that happen for the Note 3.  Conversely, it could benefit from Purple, Pink, or Blue for the female crowd as well.It is quite clear which gives it the ability to show the phone through the case.  From seeing the other reviews, and also people with clear cases on white phones - I am positive this will look very nice/nicer on a white phone.The grip is that smooth/denser-type of rubber if that makes sense.  It's soft - but grips similar to how maybe the Galaxy S3 gripped - where it provided a lot of grip because it was smooth.  If you hands are wet or if you put lotion on them or something, it will be a bit slippery at first.  But ultimately, this thing is actually the most grippy of all the cases I've owned in normal use - which is very very nice and allows you to hold the phone a little differently if you choose.  *I also feel that it has the perfect amount of grip in/out of your pocket.  It doesn't get stuck, yet it's not prone to falling out of your pocket either.As for the design and shape, it's darn-right IMPRESSIVE.  It pulls off a very nice/small sleek feel in your hand (as if it's as small as one of the thin TPU's).  Even when you see it in person, it does not look large, despite how well it protects.When I say it protects well - I feel very confident in that.  You can see how the case gives a nice lip around the screen (that's not in the way or anything), and as one other reviewer pointed out, the corners actually protrude in every direction (sides/corners/front/back) which allow the corners to really be the only part of the phone that touches a surface, no matter how you lay it down.  (This is a really great feature).  I think this also allows the phone to set down quietly on a desk, and even makes the vibrate function quieter on a desk (which is also a good thing - especially in an office environment).  **This will seemingly also protect better in face down, or back down falls.***Important:  One thing that I think might be confusing about the corners of the phone, (and is very hard to explain), is that there's actually a purposeful "gap" between the actual corner of the phone, and the inside edge/corner of the case.  (There is air in between the phone and the case in the corners).  Now it's not air pressure that protects from the drop really, but none the less, the case is firm enough to absorb the shock of a fall instead of simply transferring all of the energy directly to the phone.  Some other cases might have thick corners, but the corners are comprised of the hard material, which essentially still transfers a good bit of the energy to the phone.  This case eliminates that.  I feel this case is right up there in drop protection with your Medium Duty cases (i.e. UAG/Otterbox Commuter/etc)So all-in-all, this case is a perfect "Jack of All Trades" - in that its: Sleek; Protective (from drops/etc); Looks good; Thin; Good feel/grip.This will probably be the only case I will use for my Note 3 - because I'm really not compromising anything when using it!  (That's usually the reason i switch up cases here/there depending on what I'm doing -- "well this is good at this, but not good at this/etc".  However, this Ballistic Jewel case does it all!Now For the Ballistic Company:- Bring some more colors- Promote this case more (make it known how good it is).  This might even help drive people to your other cases as well- Make Amazon an authorized seller for crying out loud- All in all - complements on a great product!!  Lets make sure people know about it!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00FKLON1G', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00FKLON1G', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00KGU9UHS</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00KGU9UHS</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00KGU9UHS" id="B00KGU9UHS-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-06:</strong> This is an ideal device for those long family driving vacations where you are either camping or driving for the entire day and everyone has a device that they are using. If the children amuse themselves using their tablet or smartphone (just about everyone these days) then their charge will almost certainly not outlast the travel time. With this charger, capable of charging many Apple and Android devices, that problem is eliminated.This device plugs into a vehicle cigarette lighter and has three outlets, 2.1A, 2.0A and 1.0A and all three can be used simultaneously. Such capability will also relieve the parent from having to adjudicate through the problem of only having one outlet and several devices simultaneously running low on power.My daughter and I do a lot of moving from job to job in my truck and there are occasions when one of our devices runs low on power. We keep this handy for those "emergencies," I have an Android and she has an iPad.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00KGU9UHS" id="B00KGU9UHS-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-03:</strong> I received this unit for review, and it sure is nice looking. That was a big surprised, compared to so many car chargers I have! The unit is about 1&#34; x 2.4&#34; , very light, and fits great into my 12v lighter. There is a blue LED light that let's you know your unit is charging.I love that this is a real, Apple certified, Tri USB 5.1A charger. It is made to charge your Apple products (in my case an IPad Air and IPhone 5S) simultaneously. The 3 ports are 2.1A, 2.0A, and 1.0A, which are very clearly marked...a feature not found on many devices I am afraid.There is a large list of specs written in the description which, so I will not repeat them now.Suffice it to say, that this unit is very high quality, has over-current protection; short circuit protection; over heating protection; weighs .8 ounces, and rapidly charges your unit.Also, I had no radio loss or any issues with my bluetooth while using the unitThis tri  car charger is a real winner which I can highly recommend!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00KGU9UHS" id="B00KGU9UHS-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-03:</strong> Works great and feels great.

There are ports for 1.0 amp (such as mp3 players) as well as 2.0 amps and 2.1 amps (apple, android, tablets, Galaxy - all those POWER hungry devices!).  Most car circuits are designed to handle at least 5 amps, the Ford Excursions were designed to all handle 20 amp loads, so this charger should be fine to charge all 3 ports simultaneously without blowing a fuse.  It's ALWAYS a good idea to keep extra fuses in your vehicle, but we've never had an issue with this device.

It plugs in easy and barely takes up any room outside of the outlet itself.  The charger has a 2.1A port which is perfect for the iPad, and the other ports were able to simultaneously charge my iPhone and bluetooth headset.  The port labeling is clear and a nice LED lets you know that the entire device is powered.I also like the build quality with a nice aluminum housing.

It is a little loose in my vehicle's lighter receptacle and if you tug on any of the cables it can lose contact. Granted you have to tug hard, but when I tested my review sample I did just that based on how it felt when I plugged it in. It should not be a problem with normal use, but needs to be disclosed,If you use an iPhone, iPad or any other i-device this is a great way to get a charger that is built to Apple standards, but without Apple prices. More importantly, it will work with just about any USB powered device and has ports optimized with classes of devices. However, even though two of the ports are designed for devices that can make use of higher current levels, those will downshift to accommodate devices that need less.Aside from the MFi certification (and probably because of it) this charger has some built-in protective features that I love. Those are listed in the product description, so I will not repeat them here.I tested this with an iPad 2, HTC Droid Incredible and Galaxy Note 3 in the ports designed for those devices. I then retested them by replacing the HTC with a Samsung Tab 3 10.1 in the 1 Amp port and the charger still worked perfectly. My final test was in that configuration, driving the thirty miles to Daytona Beach with my Note 3 streaming music and the GPS active. Not only did this charger keep up, it fully charged it from 80% to 100. That may not sound like an achievement, but some chargers only keep up or fail to hit the 100% mark on that trip when the Note 3 is performing those tasks. I will admit that the other two devices were merely charging, but all of them were at 100% (from approximately 80 each) by the time I reached my destination.One final note: the claim that this will not get hot is absolutely true. During the above tests the charger was at ambient temperature by the time I concluded my trip (about 40 minutes). Bottom line: this is a capable charger that does everything the product description claims.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00KGU9UHS" id="B00KGU9UHS-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-16:</strong> When the TOPG car charger arrived, I was taken aback. It is small, 1.38x 0.95 x 2.36 inches. They say, the gets things come in small packages, and that is very true in this case. It is very attractive, black with a red base which holds the three USB ports. This supports high speed USB charging. It is efficient, safe and reliable.The three USB ports are the real plus with this car charger. You can charge three devices at once, but I only used two of the USB ports. I charged my iPhone and my iPod. The user suggestions are that Apple products should use the 2.0A and the 2.1A USB ports for charging. I had a long drive, 125 miles, and both devices were fully charged when I arrived.This car charger is ideal for any car, and I will put it in my purse to use to charge my devices in my car on vacation. It is small enough to be convenient to carry in my purse, without having to rumnage through my luggage at the end of the day. I am quite pleased with this car charger.

I have friends with classic cars that still have lighters and ashtrays (just don't try and use either!) For whatever reason, the silly design of the lighter has transitioned into an automobile outlet, and have become essential to everyday traveling and commuting life. My car has four outlets - one in front, one between the front seats, and two in back. And I still seem to run out of available places to plug in devices and charge stuff. When I'm driving I'll have the GPS plugged in and my cell charging.  I'll usually have the iPod charging as well. All too often I need to top-off my tablet or charge a flashlight (yes, newer models now charge from a USB port.)I have a couple of different TopG models, so my reviews for them are pretty close.One problem I have had with cheap ones in the past is heat - some chargers (technically adapters) ran so hot they were painful to touch - I could have used as a lighter.  The better quality ones (like this) have circuitry that controls the current.The metal contacts are exceptionally nice.  Yea - sounds silly. But if you've seen some of the other models that simply used bent metal on the sides and a tin tip, you'll appreciate this.  The thing does not fall out of the outlet.This version has three ports, with the amperage plainly indicate - 2.1A, 2.0A and 1.0A. These work with any USB device, but some require higher amperage for fastest charging times. If you have a device that requires a higher amperage, you may want to look at a different model.  Keep in mind that the charger will run these devices - it just won't charge as fast as possible.This is probably the coolest looking adapter. Mine is glossy black with red anodized aluminum, and is surprisingly compact. I use this to charge/power my iPod, Droid phone and Droid tablet.So why three and not two or four? Personal preference and clutter.  I have a two and three - two in the dash outlet and three between the seats.Free product provided for honest review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00KGU9UHS" id="B00KGU9UHS-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-18:</strong> This does not charge my Samsung Note 2 as advertised.

And when I say little, I meant it. The charger is maybe 2-2 and 1/2 inches long and maybe 1 1/2 inches wide at the top. The small size can make it a little difficult to unplug as depending on the design in your car it could be hard to grasp.The charger offers a 2.1, 2 and 1 Amp charging port. It works perfectly with my iPhone 5s, my Lumia 1020 and my ancient Zune. Everything charges exactly as you expect.

Total rated capacity is 5.1 amps, with one port is rated at 2.1 amps, a second rated at 2 amps, and a third at 1 amp.  The device has a blue colored brushed aluminum top, with a tiny blue LED that indicates when power is available.This appears to be a very sturdy and well designed item, with a hard plastic shell with no joints that can split apart.  The contacts are solidly placed inside the housing, so they can't twist loose, as happens with some other devices that plug into the lighter.  The shape of the device makes it easy to grasp, and plug and unplug from the socket.A sample was provided for evaluation.  While I don't like to cutter up my vehicle with cords, sometimes it can't be helped, and on those occasions, having a device like this allows you a great deal of flexibility.  The cost is reasonable, and the build quality appears to be outstanding.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00KGU9UHS" id="B00KGU9UHS-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-18:</strong> Nice, compact size and easy to carry for travel.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00KGU9UHS" id="B00KGU9UHS-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-16:</strong> The TopG 5.1 amp 3 USB port car charger is one of the highest quality and highest output car chargers on the market.Pros:-5.1 amps of output power (this means that when all the ports outputs combined they add up to a max output of 5.1 amps)-1 of the USB ports, labeled &#8220;2.1A&#8221;, has a max output of 2.1 amps which is great for charging tablets like an iPad Air (this port is designed for Apple devices like an iPad but will still work with other tablets and smartphones)-1 of USB ports, , labeled &#8220;2.0A&#8221;, has a max output of 2.0 amps which is great for charging tablets like a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 (this port is designed for Android devices like Galaxy Tabs but will still work with iPads, smartphones and other tablets)-1 of the USB ports, labeled &#8220;1.0A&#8221;, has a max output of 1.0 amps which is great for charging smartphones like an iPhone 5/5s (this port is designed for all smartphones like an iPhone 5/5s or Galaxy S4)-Comes in 3 cooling looking color combos (I have it in red/black)-LED status lights indicates that the car charger&#8217;s USB ports are ready for use and it is not bright to light up the car (in other words, it will not distract the driver)-Tight fit in the cigarette lighter socket which means it will not slide out easily during use-Tested on a car ride and it worked great for charging an iPad Air, an iPhone 5 and a Galaxy S4-Small for its very high output of 5.1 amps-Protects against over-heating, over-charging, over-current and short circuits-Overall, this is a high quality car charger that has a very high output that works very well-Excellent price!No cons that I can find about this car charger.My wishes:-Add multiple LED&#8217;s so the USB ports are visible in the dark (LED do not light up the car, just the USB ports)-Make it have a 7.2 amp output, so 3 tablets, like 3 iPad&#8217;s, can charge all at once at full speedThis is an excellent car charger and it works great.

Some menu selections need one touch, others need two.  Menu system isn't the greatest, but workable.Battery life is very good with all the sensors turned off.  With them on, I can keep a charge for a little over a day.  Ovi maps are nice (GPS is still a cool toy).Bought for the standard headphone and USB connectors.  Computer sees the 16 Gig. as a flash drive.  Plays a heavily compressed movie fairly well.  It pixelates for about 5 seconds if I change the scene.  Screen doesn't show up too well in the sun (I live in S.C.).  Can change ringtones and background without using the internet or phone company (unlike my old Samsung).  Battery is easily accessible and cheap to replace.  Keypad took a little getting used to (touchscreen) and switching to other characters.  Wi-fi is great.  I can log on at the mall, bar, stores or at home.  You will need the headphones plugged in to recieve radio stations.  Headphones suck, but not as bad as Apple's.  USB cap doesn't fit very well.  At least the lint blows out.  Screen layout has limited changes.Camera is o.k. (it's a cell) and so is the video.  Didn't realize it had a small camera sensor on the other side, so you can see yourself on the display.I'd liked to have gotten a Droid or i-Phone, but this was within my price range.  No contract either.  Put my old SIM in and connected to AT&T;'s network.  No drops / good reception.  UNLOCKED!!!Aside from the GUI (1 vs. 2 taps) I really like this phone.

I couldn't be happier with my purchase.UNBOXING: My phone came with Nokia's Car Kit which was a nice surprise. The phone bracket can be placed on the dash for using the GPS when flying down the highway. A car charger AND home charger are included along with some fancy headphones. The only accessory I needed to add was a case. Otter Box makes a great case for the X6.SET-UP: Wonderfully easy to set-up. I inserted my SIM card and plugged in the charger then off to the races. Initial set-up is quick, easy, and intuitive. Within minutes my contacts, email, 3G, and internet were running fluidly.TOUCH SCREEN: It takes a bit to get used to the screen, especially coming from a tactile keyboard on my old E71. Some actions require a double-tap while others are single taps. There is a slight color change on the buttons letting you know that a second tap is needed. If your impatient and keep hitting the buttons the X6 will lock-up. Patience, young grasshopper, patience.CALLS: No dropped calls so far with good sound clarity. The screen automatically disables itself so your cheek won't activate anything. Voice dialing is a breeze to set-up.INTERNET: Initally the X6 was somewhat slow using the built in web browser, but then I downloaded the Opera browser. Whoa Nelly! The Opera browser flies along with proper 3G speeds. Web pages can be zoomed in/out if that site is not mobile ready.MUSIC/VIDEO: The X6 has 16gb memory on board. More than enough for my music and videos. The sound is somewhat "tinny" when played through the speakers but the included headset makes up for it. Videos play without any chop and the screen resolution is wonderful.A-GPS: You will need a data plan to use the GPS. The GPS only took one minute for initial set-up and locking. The OVI Maps are okay, but installing Google Maps allows you to sync with Google and keep all your starred favorites. The Ovi Maps didn't show my street, but Google did.BLUETOOTH: My Plantronics Voyager Pro paired to the X6 within seconds. No connection issues.WIFI: Again, the Wifi worked immediately. I tested the Wifi at Borders, Starbucks, McDonalds, and the local park. No issues with scanning.CAMERA: 5mp is decent for a cellphone and the X6 doesn't slouch one bit. The Carl Zeiss lens helps, but you'll still need decent lighting. The video is adequate but nowhere near HD quality.IMPRESSION: Excellent value for the money, especially since the X6 is unlocked. No issues surfing the web, listening to music, taking pictures or watching videos. The X6 does everything it's supposed to plus more.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0036DDT74" id="B0036DDT74-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-04-04:</strong> Wow! This is a wonderful gadget. I had a Nokia 5800 NE and I decided to upgrade. I'm really satisfied with this purchase. The camera is good, the call quality is outstanding.

But, features rock!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0036DDT74" id="B0036DDT74-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-19:</strong> very good phone. my husband likes it very much.

THANKS FOR NOTHING!Below this line is my previous complaints and compliments ----------------------Everyone, I'm glad to announce that they actually fixed the "yellow-tint" pictures on the Nokia Lumia 1020 by this recently released update on AT&T; users called "The Nokia Black Update" release date December 19, 2013. So I tested the camera and little by little, those yellow-tinted problems have gone away so "CHEERS" Nokia and Microsoft, I apologies if I gave it a 1/5 star on my rating because its frustrating at first but I changed it recently thanks to that recently released black update. Now and forever I'm a Nokia fan and a Microsoft product user, I'm still testing the phone so I only gave it a 4/5 stars for now and might comeback again in a few days to test out the black update on the Lumia 1020. Who knows, I might give it a complete 5/5 star rating. Keep up the good work Microsoft and Nokia! Thanks so much.------- IGNORE MY REVIEW BELOW ----------- FOR NOWI recently have something of a problem in taking photos! All of my pictures have a yellow-tint that mixes with the white color... and in the commercials they always say its the best camera, shame on you NOKIA! I have a lot of respect before, and even bought 2 of your flagship phones, not its your fault this issue was hidden to the masses...  BEWARE, IT DESTROYS YOUR PICTURE AND MIXES YELLOW during post processing of the photo... regardless whether or not with flash or not! SHAME!PLEASE, anybody HELP ME BRING THIS UP TO NOKIA OR AT&T; before its too late, I'm a buyer myself... what is Nokia or AT&T; waiting for??? where's the firmware fix on this ISSUE!...</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DVRJ3WA" id="B00DVRJ3WA-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-26:</strong> I copied a comment from Nokia chat room. I researched because I'm having the same problem with my Nokia 1020. Very annoying and disappointed!"According to the specs, the Lumia 1020 should be able to auto-focus as close as 15 centimeters, not 15 inches. That said, I'm seeing the same problem as noted in this post. Typically, if my subject is between 15cm and 25cm away and I hold down the shutter half-way to focus, or touch the screen on a focus point, the focusing system temporarily focuses, but then immediately "pops back" out of focus.SOMETIMES I can focus up to 15cm, but it's not consistent and so I've been finding it difficult to get macro shots in general with the phone. I realize that the zoom in capability of the "pro" image minimizes this problem, but I just keep running into it. Now I know others are too. Either there is a batch of defective phones and we both got one, OR this is normal behavior for all of them."Edit (10/23/13): Well I've had this phone now for about 3 weeks and discovered that the battery starts to get really hot when I was speaking on it for over an hour and after hanging up it still continue to drain. Even when left without using it drained 80% of the battery to 10% in just 6 hours. It wasn't doing this before until last night. I charged it again and conducting more tests at this time on the battery issue. As far as camera close up shots, yes it doesn't work anything less than 6 inches, I didn't say as minimal as 1/6th. You wanted to know the truth and I'm telling you the truth. I didn't buy another 1020 from some of your responses. I exchanged it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DVRJ3WA" id="B00DVRJ3WA-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-12:</strong> I bought this simply for the camera, and was pleased with the other aspects as well. It is much faster than the N8, menus are fluid, texts are sent instantly, and the browser actually works! The camera is well reviewed elsewhere, and it is simply amazing, and the OIS allows blur free photos, even close ups. The display is big and bright, and the Nokia Maps still have offline mode, and the GPS is VERY quick to acquire satellite lock, usually within a few seconds, even with data turned off.Calls are clear, and the volume is loud enough even for outdoor use. AT&T; LTE yielded 16Mbps up and down when I ran the data test. WiFi speeds were also in that range, though that could simply be the speedtest.net app's limitation.As for the apps, there aren't many third party ones, but Microsoft and Nokia do a fair job of filling the gaps. The biggest pitfall is the total lack of support by Google of Windows Phone. There is no GMail, and the Microsoft Mail app does an ok job accessing Gmail over IMAP, though instead of deleting messages, they are tagged as &#34;Deleted Items.&#34; Drive+ is just as good as Google Maps, and Youtube can be access through the mobile site, so videos can still be viewed. Other notable non-existent apps: HBO Go, Prime Instant Video (though there is a Kindle app), and the Economist. Many games are also not available,The recent Lumia Black update rolled out quickly, plus Windows Phone lets users get the beta build before AT&T; finishes &#34;qualifying&#34; it. One very cool feature is Drive Mode- when connected to car's Bluetooth, phone will auto respond to texts that you are driving, it can also silence calls if you choose. In my opinion, the WinPho UI is easier to pickup than Android (none of the swipe nonsense or cryptic icons), and all the buttons are clearly labelled. The keyboard is a little annoying- common punctuation is one a different screen than the alphabet, but there is voice recognition for search, and a built in QR scanner.All in a all a worthy upgrade.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DVRJ3WA" id="B00DVRJ3WA-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-30:</strong> It offers only dual core and 768 resolution with a tiny battery of 2000 mah. Don't quite understand why people give it such a high rating with such a high price tag. If the price is TWO HUNDRED dollars lower, then I think it is a fair buy compare to other flagship phones. The only high point is probably the camera, but lagging in all other aspects. Windows phone 8 got potential but is still behind iOS and Android. Apps are limited, no quad-core and 1080 support and charges a premium. Shame on Nokia and Microsoft.The UI is indeed attractive looking and operation is very smooth, but lacks in the key areas like folders, screen tilt control/lock and dedicated document reader. Some of the folder functionality can be found in "Hubs" but not intuitive to use and is limited to the specific applicaiton only. The tile structure is only good for small amount of apps. It will will be nice if added apps can be freely organized by users at will like iOS and Android. The lacks of apps is a big drawback as well but it is getting better everyday and as I said this phone is in a catch-up mode. The UI is nice but functionality is lagging. iOS is losing its luster in UI look and feel but it works much, much better and simpler and what can be more important than that?Android is doing much better with apps and functionality, and even iOS can learn a thing or two from, but WP8 is absolutely lagging. The only advantage it has is probably the integrated Office hub, but even this is slowly going away since Office 365 is now available for iOS as well. Lack of a dedicated ebook reader is a smaller drawback since there are other apps available, but iBook stands high and tall and I won't trade anything for it.WP8 is not bad and has the potential to be a good product, but it IS lagging behind and charges a premium! What in the world would I pay a premium for Microsoft's experiment while there are other better products already in the market? The only way they can survive is to offer it as a free OS like what Google has done. Market will only reward leaders like Apple. Until the day Windows phone is indeed a better user experience no one should pay an extra dime for it.This thing is bulky comparing to other phones because of the camera, not a big thing but still. The camera is nice for sure but still no replacment for SLR. The battery is NOT replacable and there is NO SD card reader! What in the world is Nokia thinking? If Nokia won't have iOS at least they should try to beat iPhone on the hardware side, but NO, they won't do it. This phone is not even on par with HTC or Samsung. The sale of Nokia mobile division to Microsoft told the reason why this product won't suceed.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DVRJ3WA" id="B00DVRJ3WA-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-16:</strong> Would not post a long review..for detailed analysis you can see experts reviews everywhere on the web...just google..My Review:After using Lumia 1020....it made me feel the Iphone 5 was very mediocre device that i used earlier...Now with Lumia 1020 it felt a clear evolution to an ultimate smartphone experience that cannot be described in words... who says windows is missing apps..i got all the apps I needed and they felt more faster and smoother...the camera is awesome!!!!!...just go for it...its worth the every dollar...</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DVRJ3WA" id="B00DVRJ3WA-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-05:</strong> The camera quality if just wow!  The camera takes very very good photos even on auto settings.  I love the fact that I can take a regular picture and then zoom in later and crop what I want.  It's truly amazing.  Nokia did an excellent job of putting this level of photo capability into a smartphone.Windows Phone 8 isn't as bad as a lot of people in the Android/Apple camp would like you to believe. It comes with the latest iteration and everything seems to work well.  I don't use a whole lot of apps, I just use Twitter (Rowi), Facebook (Official App), Evernote, Podcast listening (built-in one for WP8 works well), Personal Finance (Money Wallet).  So far so good.  I also have an HTC One and iPhone 5.  I've been able to function independent of the other phones quite well.  I think it is mainly because I use my MS Live account across all platforms via Exchange for my PIM needs.  I also don't have such a symbiotic relationship with either Apple or Google so it works out pretty great for me.  I always try not to get myself mucked up too deep into one eco-system, but I do let MS handle all my PIM info and it has worked to my advantage for quite some time.If you love taking good pictures and you are not tied down to one eco-system, this phone is for you without a doubt.Enjoy!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DVRJ3WA" id="B00DVRJ3WA-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-15:</strong> I purchased this phone for my fiancee who LOVES taking pictures, but she didn't get it for a few days so I spent some time playing around with it.  Here's what I noticed:1) The camera is amazing... hands down the best phone camera I've ever used.2) The battery life is pretty good -- although I'm almost always in 4G and I had the camera grip on the phone most of the time so I can't give any exact numbers3) Windows 8 Mobile is REALLY good.  Applications open quickly, nothing froze, features like internet sharing is free, there was next to no bloatware and I was able to uninstall what little bloatware there was. (Personally I have a Galaxy S4)4) The phone feels nice to hold.  Not having the rounded edges I thought would be a huge down side, but I never once felt like it was going to slip out of my hand like I have with other phones.5) Microsoft Office is included! I'm not really sure how much Microsoft Office will be used on her phone, but it's nice to know she has the ability if the need ever exists.6) The camera grip was a fantastic idea by Nokia.  I bought the phone from the Microsoft Store and received a free camera grip and I can already tell how much nicer it's going to make picture taking.  The camera grip has a battery built in by the way and it has a tripod mount on the bottom for anyone who plans on using it for that.All in all my cell phone plan has three phones: Samsung Galaxy S4, Apple iPhone 5, and now Nokia Lumia 1020.  I've seen and used all three and this one makes me a little sad I chose the Samsung (don't get me wrong--I love my S4 nonetheless but change is always nice!)  As always, if you have any questions please let me know and I'll test it out on the phone then reply so hopefully you'll know everything you want to know before purchasing a phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DVRJ3WA" id="B00DVRJ3WA-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-06:</strong> This phone is simply amazing. The camera is my favorite camera I've ever owned and I have a Canon Digital SLR too. The ~40MP image has to be seen to understand it. You can make out such tiny details in images when you zoom in that it is crazy. The thing that makes it such a great camera is that it is attached to a portable computer too. The other apps like the smart cam app can do some amazing processing (not just lame filters) to create cool composite shots, or to remove people that are moving in the background. I love that it comes in yellow too.

Reason is poor ear piece sound. After using it for a while, i found talking to some one on phone ear piece is really difficult. I need to readjust my ear multiple times to get the sound better.While rating we must show all negatives so that manufacturer may fix it soon.This is my 4th Lumia phone after 900 and 920 and 520. I bought 920 a developer edition for 1000 bugs but sold in 3 months as it felt heavy. I have owned all models of iphone, Htc One etc. But the beauty of lumia 1020 is not comparable. I bought it at full price from at&t; and got it unlocked by them.Things I love:1 Obviously Camera. The whole idea of not carrying another camera for most daily shooting was my prime motto in buying this phone. I had HTC One and iphones but they are not comparable to this phones Cam.2 Screen: Though it is smaller than HTC One, I don't miss HTC One. The white on black background is what I missed in all other phones. Emails looks so good that I got never satisfied with other phones.3 Speakers: Much Much better then HTC One. Every one praised htc one's dual speakers. But I owned it and I never felt htc one speakers were adequate. But my lumia 1020 easily overtakes htc one. Moreover the quality of sound is very very good. You can easily hear different notes in the music.3 Form factor: !020 is much smaller and lighter then lumia 920. First feel of lumia 920 was heavy and thicker then comparators. But I was still happy with it. But 1020 is an improved one. I don't think much changed except making wireless charging external and reducing the weight.4 lanyard: This may not be big thing for others, but for me it is. It is much easier to wrist strap and don't worry to slip phone. Also I keep it out of pocket and easily pull it out. All old phones used to have this but in Smartphone I don't remember any other maker used it.5 Wireless charging: Though external, but still has the wireless charging feature. So easy to charge in office. Don't need to look for cables . Just place it on the wireless charger and you have full charge when u need it.6 YouTube: I believe YouTube video downloads only available in windows phone. I couldn't found in iphone or HTC. There were workarounds but not anything native. It is so much easier to download YouTube movie and watch it in gym in just 5-10 minutes. I love this app.7 Build quality: As per nokia the body of lumia is made of plastic which is throughout one color. I mean if you make a scratch on it, you can rub or remove that layer and original color will pop out. This is unlike coloring done on iphone.8 Apps: Though there are fewer apps then ios and android, I don't miss any specific apps. I had iphone for 4 years and android for a year but still I don't miss any app. Moreover apps on lumia looks much beautiful then others. Also they are more stable then android. May be fans won't agree but it's my opinion. Even I was fan of iphone until steve's demise. After Steve there is no innovation at all.9 Interface: Windows interface is so simple and easy to learn. OLED screen really makes difference. White fonts on black screen really pops out.10 Battery: If you are careful, you can easily get whole day battery life. If you want more then you can turn on battery saver. Battery saver easily doubles battery life. On my lumia 520 it runs almost 5-6 days. However I rarely use lumia 520. but still being 4g LTE, I expect it o run down within 3 days.11 Call quality is good.Things I hate:1 Though phone by itself not heavy, but adding external wireless cover make sit heavy. I can still live with it, but it would have been better if we got wireless charging with same form factor.2 When online music is played through lumia speakers, I noticed that other web browsing like Microsoft store app browsing becomes very slow. I have very high speed internet and I don't think playing music will slow down other browsing. I never had this issue with other phones.3 Though it has 2 Gb ram, it felt some time its getting slow. Response is slow some times. If I close all apps by clicking back button, phone responds normal. So I guess hardware is lagging somewhere.4 Speakers: Though it is awesome for music, it is not enough for phone calls. There must be something restricting it from being loud. May be because of echo they reduced volume on calls. Volume on call could be better.5 Bluetooth profile selection is missing. I want to connect to 2 bluetooth devices same time. One for voice only and other for music only. But there is no way I can configure that in phone.Going forward I will update this review according to my experience with it. So far I whole heartedly recommend this phone despite the flaws.Update: After using for a while i found the ear piece volume is not enough for slightly noisy places. I prefer the sound to be 30% more then what it is. I believe this is definitely firmware as the speaker also produces very less volume during call and loud enough for music.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DVRJ3WA" id="B00DVRJ3WA-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-26:</strong> Picked up the phone today replacing my already awesome (and still on contract) Lumia 920.

This is designed with those who love camera tech and want more from their photos then just a &#34;quick snap&#34; memory.  This is a serious camera.  The tools and abilities go far beyond just nice details.  The amount of top end photo hardware- from the 41-MP camera and it's numerous megapixel settings to it's optical stabilization abilities to it's edit tools- are nearly limitless.  Nokia has added in so many software options to it's hardware that you could spend days just playing with the options.  Nokia even has &#34;lense&#34; software to add effects or remove unwanted images.  The amount of detail and color reproduction in your pictures is mind blowing.  Sometimes it is hard to remember this is on a phone.As a smartphone, it is excellent as well.  WP 8 soars on this hardware.  Excellent UI and seamless operation, there is no lag and no problem with commands.  The app selection has grown to a very comfortable level.  As a phone it has very good reception and the clarity is on par with any top end smartphone.  The 4.5&#34; screen is bright and provides plenty of room for the keyboard and veiwing of webpages and apps.Both Nokia and Microsoft has been excellent about supporting and updating their WP 8 devices.  Firmware and software upgrades have been coming from both companies regulary since it's release.I strongly suggest the Lumia 1020 for those who are excited for the next step in photos from a smartphone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DVRJ3WA" id="B00DVRJ3WA-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-11:</strong> The Lumia 1020 appears to be one thing: the camera.Nokia's design philosophy seems to be to take the best options available from point and shoot compact digital cameras, apply them to a super compact camera and then add on smartphone capabilities.The sensor on the camera is 41 MP. This is nearly on par with the sensor (MP wise, NOT QUALITY) Nikon's current big sensor DSLR. The quality from the DSLR is better, no doubt and I've seen plenty of sample photos that speak to this. The price difference, even for an unlocked 1020, is nearly 3x the price and doesn't include the cost of an interchangeable lens. Again, the quality from the DSLR is better, but for a digital compact camera... for a &#34;simple&#34; SMARTPHONE, this is massive.And the quality from the camera is phenomenal. I don't think the 41 MP results are usable for prints up to the same sizes of DSLR large sensors, but I don't think you would have a problem getting a really nice 13x19 print from the 1020.In terms of the phone itself, if you've used a Windows 8 phone before, you know the drill. For me, using it has become second nature, and I personally prefer it over the Android OS. The only thing it lacks is Apps. With Nokia's debut of the Lumia 1520, we finally have real Instagram (beta) support, but there are still some &#34;major&#34; apps missing. No Candy Crush? Vine... was just announced recently and is available... so the must haves ARE coming. Some games will be missing forever, but I can live with that.If you're thinking of moving to Windows Phone from Android or iOS, first keep in mind that if you paid for any app, you will either need to rebuy or live without it. Second, make note of any app you use that is MUST have. Then look through the Windows Phone App Store on-line to ensure it exists. If there is something missing you cannot live without, even if you need an awesome camera, I would recommend you not switch at this time. Or you will need to decide, is the awesome camera worth no longer having this capability.In terms of performance, the 1020 is great. I believe the hardware is the same as the 925 I have used and I've not experienced any issues with the main functions of Windows Phone. There IS some lag involved in photo shooting, but I attribute that to the 41 MP camera and the amount of data it needs to push around. It isn't a deal breaker for me, but if you think it will be for you, you may want to hit an ATT store or a Radio Shack and see if they will let you try before you buy.Overall, this is a spectacular and amazing camera, with a really nice smartphone attached.

I have been using Android powered phones for the past number of years and when my contract was up I went right for another one... the Moto X. I have to say that I was completely disappointed that compatibility with cars, headsets, speakers, turned out how it did. Overall I felt like I bought a basic device that &#34;most&#34; things work. It needs a lot of refinement as compared to my S2 that I had it was faster and had much better battery life, but compatibility was simply not there. AT&T; was superb in handling the return of the Moto X and sending out the Lumia 1020. I can also say Motorola when I did call to try to sort out things were also superb--- both companies called back, followed up, and made sure I was happy--- no matter what. I just keep asking--- where did that come from!Moving on to getting my Lumia 1020. I am a technology person for my career and personally for my stuff and like any new device figuring out the phone was fairly simple. I have to say that it was a nice change and after an hour I had all of my apps that I needed and had most of everything setup without any real hitch. As far as how the phone feels... the OS is super smooth and it feels like a cross between an iPhone for simplicity and an Android phone for being less restricted/ constricting.One of the features that I do like is how it handles email. All accounts are separate/ mutually exclusive. I use my phone for business and personal use and with our Android phones.... I used the default mail client for work and Gmail for personal. The problem is that for one personal account that is not a Gmail account, I either have to use the default mail client or an aftermarket app (and of the five that I tried) that are simply poor. The problem is that when you use the default mail client it can confuse where it was sent from--- and that is a huge problem. With the Lumia and the accounts being completely independent, a separate mail client is not necessary. Slightly different in how it works, but for me it is the proper way to handle email.Of course the camera is very good and has a real flash. Otherwise, for now I would definitely recommend the phone as it is a great size (i.e. not too big), the screen is very sharp, and it flat out works damn well. If they can get their marketing in order and give it some traction.... they will have a much bigger part of the smartphone market.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00DVRJ3WA', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00DVRJ3WA', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B003NQ2REK</h2>    <p class="price"> $B003NQ2REK</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003NQ2REK" id="B003NQ2REK-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-24:</strong> Our neighbor vacationed in his 5th wheel in Oregon all last summer and he was not able to get a signal from the RV space he was in.

In the mail I have the 40" antenna "CA40M" just to see what a ridiculously-long antenna can do.I installed the antenna on my trunk and I see an increase in dBm (signal strength) as well as download speeds (24Mbps -> 31Mbps).  I haven't had a chance to test it's "max-range" in the middle of the desert yet, but what I see from in-my-garage testing shows promise.The product also fits my S4 well.

Product was inferior and support was bad.Good:The package was not as nice as some others I have seem but ok.The contents were fairly complete.  It included a card bit to use as a squeegee, a suction cup to hold the glass, a small screen cleaning cloth and a small wet-wipe, basic instructions and two stickers to remove dust.Bad:Screen fit is not horrid but a little below average.  There will be gapping on all sides.  The fitment around the button is rather loose.The cardboard does not make a good squeegee.  It crumples under fairly mild pressure.  I suspect it may have been exposed to a little bit of moisture during the packing process.The microfiber cloth is too small to be used with the cardboard.  If you are going to advise that these two be used together to remove bubbles, then they should be sized to work together and they are not.The bigger issue is the glue they used on the glass protector.  It is not very good.  The Spigen I used on my iPhone was an entirely different animal.  Once it was attached, it was solidly attached.  Due to the low quality of the glue on the  Tech Armor product I was able to remove it easily to check if it was dust causing the problem (it was not).  What it does is not attach correctly to several inches on the right side.  Not right at the edge (which would be hard to see) but in on the viewing area.  In total 4 small stripes (like a dashed line) just over 2 inches long and around 1/16th to 1/8th of an inch wide.Contacting customer support resulted in a very prompt reply which essentially said there is no support for this product.  Specifically it said that this was a 1 time use product and so doe not come with a lifetime warranty.  Which is funny since this was not an issue which showed up over time but upon initial application due to a defect in the item they shipped me.In that this is a premium product, I would strongly urge you to buy from one of their competitors which actually support their product.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CD0I8EK" id="B00CD0I8EK-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-03:</strong> This is a nice screen protector but it is thick and my bumper case does not fit properly without creating a bubble under the glass.

Better protection with this and with the feel of OEM glass, best of both worlds.Installation was a breeze, but there is bubbling still at the corners near the ear piece. I did have to adjust it after first application and removing it was a bit difficult, but since there is still bubbling on mine I was able to remove it fairly easily and aligned the protector better.Despite the added bulk (which is minimal) the cases I use (SGP Neo Hybrid and Slim Armor) are not affected by it. So I would imagine just about any case would work with this screen protector. For just $15 and a lifetime warranty, why would you look at any other screen protector? Get the one that protects your phone best with its tempered glass and it still leaves you with that OEM glass feel that we all sacrifice with tradition screen protectors, no matter how much they claim to feel like glass.10/10.

I was using the Tech Armor Privacy Screen Protector on my S4 and I loved it, but wanted to try a clear protector, as I missed the vibrancy of my screen. I knew I wanted a Tech Armor screen protector but wasn't sure which one. I liked the idea of the Ballistic Glass protector, so after reading alot of reviews (good and not so good) and viewing the installation instructions, decided to order. I ordered on a Thursday early evening and received my order the next day, Friday early afternoon. (Thank you, Amozon Prime membership....love it!!)I know by reading past reviews there is some question as to what is included for installation. There is ONE tab cover on the side that gets attached to the screen, and a small suction cup is provided to assist with application for the other side. Just make sure you moisten the suction cup slightly before you apply it, to insure a constant grip. After that, installation was a snap. And the protector is AWESOME! Clear and smooth.....I love it.There was a question concerning what cases will work with this screen protector.....because Im a gadget gal, I have a few different cases for my S4. I do recommend picking a case that doesnt hug the edges too tightly. Im using a Tech21 Impact Mesh Case and its a perfect match.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CD0I8EK" id="B00CD0I8EK-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-12:</strong> I use Tech Armor Premium HD screen protectors on all my devices.  They work well, are inexpensive, and usually come in a 3-pack.  When I realized that Tech Armor also made a glass screen protector for the Galaxy S4, I knew I had to try it and Tech Armor was nice enough to send me one to try.DESIGN & FEATURESThe Premium Ballistic Glass screen protector is a thin piece of tempered glass, cut precisely to fit on top of the Samsung Galaxy S4.  It is crystal clear and doesn't appear to effect the clarity of the screen at all.  Compared to "wet" screen protectors and PET film screen protectors, the tempered glass feels much smoother when swiping your finger on it.  It feels as good, if not better than the original Galaxy S4 screen.The only other device that I use a real glass screen protector on is my Canon DSLR.  I'm not worried about scratches as much as I am about breakage.  Real glass screen protectors can help reduce the chances of getting a cracked screen by taking the bulk of the impact.  I'm assuming that the Tech Armor Ballistic glass screen protector offers the same type of protection.Another nice thing about the Ballistic Glass is that you won't see many smudges or fingerprints.  It does a great job of keeping itself clean and when I do get smudges on it, I just wipe it off with a soft cloth (usually my t-shirt).  Dust does tend to collect around the edges a bit, but I just clean it off every so often.  I use the Ballistic Glass with a Speck CandyShell Grip case without any problems.INSTALLATIONInstalling the Ballistic Glass is similar to PET films, but can be more challenging in some respects and easier in others.  The packaging came with a suction cup that allows you to hold the glass without touching the edges, which reduces the possibility of getting dust stuck underneath.  After cleaning the screen with the included wipe, you gently place the glass on your S4, then press down on it with your fingers.  If it's not lined up exactly the way you want it, you can move it around a tiny bit by the edges before pressing down on it.  With PET films, you normally can't move them at all once they're on.There were some rainbow spots at first, but they went away within a day or so.  If you need help, Tech Armor has a YouTube install video that should give you a good idea of what the procedure is like.  The only tip I'd add is to make sure that you press down firmly on the suction cup to make sure it has a good grip on the glass.  I was all gentle about it and the suction cup released the glass right as I was about to put it on my S4.SUPPORT & WARRANTYI also want to mention that Tech Armor's support and warranty are amazing.  They really stress the lifetime warranty on their screen protectors in their product descriptions.  To be honest, I wasn't really expecting much support or service for a $7 product (PET screen protectors), but when I contacted them, they were prompt and courteous.  They even responded to me on a weekend.  When all was said and done, I had replacement screen protectors for my wife's Galaxy S3 in just a few days time, at no additional cost to me.  In case you can't tell, I was really impressed.CONCLUSIONThe Tech Armor Ballistic Glass screen protector is a great way to protect the screen on your Samsung Galaxy S4.  It's significantly more expensive than Tech Armor's other screen protectors and there's only one in the package, but if you want the ultimate in screen protection, this is it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CD0I8EK" id="B00CD0I8EK-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-13:</strong> This product is a lot like the GLAS.tR protector that is an actual piece of glass that goes over your phone's *glass* screen.  I had GLAS.tR too and it gave me fits during installation.  This one however was so very easy to install.  The anti-static wipe they provided in the box was the first one I've ever used that actually kept dust from getting on the screen for the 30 seconds it took me to get the screen protector installed.  And luckily I dropped the protector on perfectly the first time.  So far no scratches, it almost never needs any type of cleaning, and it's very inexpensive compared to similar products.  Best screen protector I've ever purchased.And just as a side note, I used to buy the 3-pack flimsy protectors, but they would always get irreparable scratches on them after 6 weeks of use or so.  I tried to just rely on the Gorilla Glass and after about a month I saw a hairline scratch in the screen.  So that's when I bought this item, and luckily once installed it covered up the scratch on the screen.  Needless to say, don't trust Gorilla Glass.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CD0I8EK" id="B00CD0I8EK-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-20:</strong> Buttery smooth and scratch resistant for almost 6 months now.....</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CD0I8EK" id="B00CD0I8EK-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-26:</strong> This is hands down the best screen protector out there.

They only requested I submit a photo of the broken screen (logical to keep scammers from requesting free screens!). They express shipped a replacement. Excellent customer support. It may be that they want to provide themselves some discretion on a &#34;Lifetime replacement warranty&#34; by saying Ballistic Glass protectors don't have this.

It was easy to install (the directions are great) although I did have a couple of bubbles. I also have one dust spot that I just can't get rid of. The bubbles I got rid of but the dust spot that is attached to the protector, I just can't remove no matter what. Luckily, it does not interfere with the screen and it disappears unless you are really staring at it.This is so smooth, I don't even know it is on my screen. Alignment was really easy and I was able to peel it back off and reposition or attempt to get rid of the dust spot and replace it again.It does have two small bubble areas that are up against the edge of the screen and perhaps from the case I have on (which is not a super intrusive case but may be adding just enough to pop the edge of the protector.) I took my case off to install the protector but put it back on again shortly after. Again, this doesn't get in the way of viewing anything.I've seen similar glass protectors for double the price. I am really pleased so far with this model and I was happy to be provided a sample for testing and review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CD0I8EK" id="B00CD0I8EK-review25" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-11:</strong> I am sure these are great as I have them for my Note 3.

It has brought me piece of mind when I have this applied to my phone. I don't have to worry about scuffing the phone's actual phone screen and this layer protects it. I sometimes have to put in phone in my pants pocket where my car keys/change could be an issue. So far, after several months of usage, there have been no scratches nor any cracks. Also, this keeps my phone's screen clean. The protective glass will still get smudging from finger printers. Not a big deal and that can be cleaned off. Another thing I noticed is that it doesn't cover the the entire screen. It will leave the sensors and front facing camera untouched. I'm assuming this was designed on purpose as a layered glass may have hindered the sensors/camera abilities. I also like the fact that included buttons for the home screen button to allow it be be rise above the protective glass. Without them, it leaves a little crevice where the home button would be. I have no problem using a case, as I am using thisi-Blason Prime Series Dual Layer Holster Case Kick Stand Compatible with Samsung Galaxy S4 SIV S IV i9500 with Locking Belt Swivel Clip Manufactured by i-Blason (Blue)with no issues.Update (30-OCT-2013) - Not sure how or why this happened, but a big area of the screen developed an air bubble underneath the screen protector. I've taken care of my phone and have had no drops occurred. For some reason, the air bubble appeared out of nowhere and it won't go away. I've tried reapplying it and my attempts to push away the air bubble has been futile. I understand with any screen protector, there will be small bubbles that will never go away or dust particles land on the screen...that I know. However, the screen protector was placed correctly without any issues, but a large bubble has appeared. Normally, I'm ok with small air bubbles and they're hardly noticeable. However, the large air bubble is very visible when the screen is off and when the screen is on. It's develop into a giant glare issue when the screen is on. It's bothered me a lot, so I had no choice but to remove the screen protector.The product had so much potential, but after several months, the air bubble issue has gotten out of hand.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CD0I8EK" id="B00CD0I8EK-review28" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-21:</strong> This product is wonderful!

I contacted tech armor and they sent me a replacment but they sent me a cheap screen protector that wasnt even made of glass, its one of the 30 cent ones you can buy on amazon. When I contacted the customer service they didn't respond I have sent over 4 emails to the customer service and after the 5th email I got a response saying "I am sorry we can not help you."  The the glass screen protector scratches fairly easy too. I had it one for 2 days and there were scratches all over it and I never keep anything else in my pocket with my phone I bough the Zagg Invisishield HD(there is a difference HD is much more clearer) and they warranty exchange your product for the life of your device. I have already gotten 2 replacements and they are always more than willing to help. That is why i will always choose ZAGG as the best screen protectors because you get a quality product and the BEST WARRANTY of any screen protector.  Ill never buy another tech armor product again and I will never recommend them to anyone.  If you do buy this item if you dont install it right the first time or if dust gets under the screen your S.O.L. because the tech armor customer service are a joke.UPDATEI contacted tech armor and this time spoke to another person and he sent me a new product.  I installed it and it worked great for about 2 weeks. It actually looks awesome if you install it correctly because it feels like glass and is sorta scratch resistant. I always keep it in my pocket by itself never with anything else in there and never dropped it but somehow scratches showed up. I had my phone in between my legs as i was driving and had a metal business card holder on my leg and the little metal business card holder slid off my leg and hit the corner of the screen protector which caused a tiny tiny chip in the glass screen protector.  Then i dropped my phone from about 3 feet onto hardwood and the screen protector cracked all over. So i went back to my ZAGG invishield HD screen protector because they give you unlimited exchanges.  What really  burns me most about this product is that if you get dust under the item on installation or install it crooked its done for because you can only apply it once.  Even if you install it in a bathroom with the hot shower going and its really foggy dust still shows up its not full proof.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CD0I8EK" id="B00CD0I8EK-review32" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-22:</strong> Easy install and decently priced.

I am not the world's leading expert on screen protector installation. And neither is the average user. That being said, this isn't my first screen protector install and many before have been trouble-free. Also, this is not an &#34;average&#34; screen protector from the leading &#34;W-branded&#34; brick and mortar retailer. It's also definitely better quality than you'd find at the local dollar store. One would expect the quality of a screen protector that sets you back half as much as one of those leading &#34;O-brand&#34; phone cases to be pretty good. And for the most part, the actual glass part of this screen protector is VERY GOOD quality. Think of it this way: Would you buy a hand-made Rolls Royce (for the price of a Rolls Royce) if it came with a maintenance plan that only permitted you to have it serviced at a Yugo dealer? The ballistic glass screen protector is the Rolls Royce in this example--sleek, sexy and very high quality. The &#34;tools&#34; to install this beast just aren't up to the task and neither are the instructions. So 5 stars for the high quality material of the actual screen protector and -2 stars for the Yugo-grade tools included in the package equals my 3 star rating. Let me explain...Some people talk about installing this (or any screen protector for that matter) in a steamy bathroom as a way to ensure that there are not dust particles falling onto the screen during the install. Those are the people who were successful at installing it without bubbles from specks of dust. Even after watching the Youtube video and reading the instructions that came with this screen protector, I still managed to get 3 dust particles trapped between the screen and the protector. I did not do the install in a steamy bathroom, as I didn't want to accidentally trigger the water damage labels on a brand new phone. Perhaps I would have taken that chance if I knew it was the only way to avoid ending up with bubbles despite all of my attempts to do the install in the cleanest of conditions. Perhaps if the instructions were to tell the user to install it in a steamy bathroom (and explain why), along with better quality installation &#34;tools&#34;, this would have been a 5-star review.The pros:--Better quality material than the flimsy plastic screen protectors (great feel vs. those plastic protectors)--Easier to install than plastic screen protectors--The screen protector does come with &#34;home screen stickers&#34; (in white and black--they may or may not actually match the actual color of your phone) to raise the home button (since this screen protector is thicker than many). I left mine off to prevent the button from being pressed while in my pocket.The cons:--Right off the bat, the #2 tab (that covers the side of the protector that touches the screen) came off without the plastic film it was supposed to take with it, leaving me with the difficult task of peeling that protective film off of the now naked adhesive side of the screen protector (it's possible that the extra fiddling around to get the protective film off attracted dust particles to the adhesive).--As at least one other user stated, the flimsy paperboard squeegee is of little help and bends with even moderate pressure. For a screen protector that costs half as much as one of the leading brands of phone cases, I don't think a squeegee made of hard plastic is too much to ask for.--The cleaning cloth is not really even big enough to be used with the squeegee, and it slips off of the flimsy paperboard squeegee far too easily, leaving the installer again thinking they do not have the correct tools for the job.--Lastly, the Youtube video instructions are based on the package containing two suction cups--it appears to be based on an install for an iPhone. The package for the Samsung Galaxy S4 contains only one suction cup, leaving the installer wondering if they should place it in the center or offset it a bit. So while it's helpful to have a Youtube video available for reference, it should be correct for the actual product being installed (or at least for the correct number and placement of suction cups).What I'd change if I could:--Instruct the installer/user to install the screen protector in a very steamy environment (so the water molecules can attach to dust particles and drag them down to the floor prior to installation). Include this information in the product instructions that come with the screen protector AND in the Youtube video. By explaining WHY a steamy environment is best, the user at least has the information up front. The user can then make an informed choice as to their installation environment. It would also improve the user experience when they subsequently complete a flawless installation, and they would remember Tech Armor for their next screen protector purchase.--Direct the user to a Youtube installation video that applies to their particular purchase (or something close to it). If their purchase includes only one suction cup, that's what the install should be based on.--Include quality installation tools or don't bother. I'm not a surgeon. If the numbered &#34;Step 2&#34; tab comes off of the protective film leaving me with no way to remove the protective film from the adhesive side of the glass, that doesn't bode well for a great installation experience. A flimsy paperboard squeegee doesn't get the job done when you're told in the instructions to apply pressure to remove air bubbles. And the microscopic cleaning cloth does a poor job covering and staying on that squeegee. For the price of this screen protector, the user wants to have complete confidence that the install with be flawless. Go that extra mile and include a hard plastic squeegee and double the size of the cleaning cloth. At least one of your lower-priced competitors does.--Don't harass your buyers to write reviews. I've received at least 2 emails asking for me to review the product less than a month after purchase. I purposely waited to write a review to ensure that the product was durable and to see if the bubbles would dissipate on their own. Alas, they did not.Overall, this is a great concept and while I believe the quality of the screen protector is pretty high, the poor quality &#34;tools&#34; provided in the package make the installation process less than stellar. I do in fact feel safer with this screen protector than with none (my reason for purchasing this was not so much to protect from scratches, but to protect against shattering). A 2-year contract is a long time to wait if you shatter your screen in month 2 of 24. It's also a long time to have to stare at 3 prominent dust bubbles that could have been avoided by including better installation instructions and tools. With an explanation of why it's best to install in a steamy environment, a protective film that doesn't require surgery to remove from the screen protector AND including a durable squeegee and bigger cleaning cloth, this could have been a 5-star product. Failing that, it's not quite ready for prime-time.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CD0I8EK" id="B00CD0I8EK-review36" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-31:</strong> I had no idea they made glass screen protectors.

Very recommended.I followed the directions and the video guidance, and this protector went on easily without a single hassle. If you would like to see pictures that I took of it in use, go back to the screen protector's main sales page, scroll down to where the "Most Helpful Customer Reviews" section starts, then look to the right of that area for the "Product Images From Customers" section. I took a shot of the shipping box too, as it shows the Lifetime Warranty seal.Here's what I found:* Excellent cutout fit: Perfect pattern for use with the S4; everything lined up* Very clear: Little degradation of screen clarity or brightness, if any at all* Smooth: My finger glides across this protector without difficulty* Easy to apply: Straightforward application and the first time I had no bubbles... none.* No fingerprints: Seriously, this thing just does not show fingerprints. Clear.The retail packaging and Amazon listing description both confirm that the protector has a "Lifetime Warranty" --- so if any problem arises with this case I will return here to describe what occurred and how resolution was handled. We did receive this protector gratis from the manufacturer and have put it through the paces to objectively find out how well it fit and performed. My statements here reflect that testing.Bottom line: If you are looking for a protector of this size and style for your Galaxy S4, this is a great unit at a decent price that was shipped very quickly. I recommend it highly based on our experience with it.Go for it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CD0I8EK" id="B00CD0I8EK-review38" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-06:</strong> I previously used Tech Armor's Samsung Galaxy S4 SIV Premium High Definition (HD) Clear Screen Protectors, and liked them a lot better than my previous ones.  However, after reading about the advantages of glass screen protectors, I decided to take the jump.  As Tech Armor's glass had pretty good ratings and at a good price, I decided to take the plunge.  Installation was a cinch (this is not a product that you can reapply, so take your time and clean all dust as instructed, and take your time to align properly).  Feel is great, no loss of resolution, and no fingerprints!Best part if you enjoy Airview (which I have heard does not work with some competition glass), rest assured it worked in my case, with no decrease on sensitivity.  Gestures also worked fine for me.  If I really had to nitpick, a) glass does not fit over the entire surface, but in an Otterbox Commuter case or any case with a "lip", the lip will cover the contours well (I would assume most people with an S4 would have a case), and b) if you decide to use the adhesive home buttons to raise it, be aware that they have a plastic look and feel as compared to the brushed metal look and feel of the S4, but they work fine, and are a good tradeoff for great glass.

My work area was a piece of computer paper. I followed the directions provided and only ended up with one little piece of dust after the initial installation.

I was surprised at how bulky it is. I have a Droid Razr Maxx. It is slightly larger footprint and at least twice as thick and 3 times the weight. Thats the good news.  The instructions tell you to ONLY charge it with included A/C adapter. I have a DC charger for the car and wanted to charge it with that, using a USB cable. I was quite surprised that none of the adapters included with this device would fit into the power INPUT connector. Thus they force you to charge with the A/C adapter.

I then put a white noise sound on phone and fell asleep. After 7 or so hours of non-stop white noise, I awake and find this device has 1 of 4 indicator lights on. This tells me it is 25% charged (thus consumed 75%). Seems I never goto bed without at least a 50% charge already on phone so something is really draining this device. I really don't expect it would hold up to multiple charges as advertised. If I am not using it properly, there is no indication of such. I have the 10k mAh size.I regret buying something so bulky, but I had a 1800 mAh device and it would not charge my phone at all.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005NGKR54" id="B005NGKR54-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-11:</strong> I'm amazed at how much power is packed into this small device.  I use it to power/recharge my phone while  using it as a WiFi HotSpot for my Nexus 7 and/or laptop.  I no longer have to worry about draining my phone's battery, or stopping to look for a place to plug in and recharge all of my gadgets.  This is GREAT for anyone who travels, or for when you don't have the opportunity to stop somewhere long enough to recharge your electronic devices.  It comes with a large assortment of adapters that fits virtually any electronic gizmo ever made.  I'm very impressed with the engineering and usefulness that went into this little powerhouse.  A GREAT buy!

These are the same: B005NGKR54; B005NGLTZQ; B005NGLBHM; B005NGNKNK; B005XQSN9G.When I say EVOPower, it includes the abovementioned "Universal" "Anker" labels. It's the same machine. I happen to have bought this battery that had an "EZOPower" label.Dimensions: 3-1/8" across x 5" deep x 15/16" high.Weight: 11 oz.12V and 9V.I bought this for iPhone, iPad (1), and iPod Touch. iPad (1) means the first iPad.I took a flight cross-country (roughly 12 hours total travel time), and wanted to listen to music on my iPhone while waiting for the planes and on the planes. I listened to music and watched the in-iPhone battery-indicator go from 100%, 85%, 70%, 55%, 40% in three hours. Depressing. I had to stop listening because I had to leave some juice for phone calls--not good to have a dead phone when traveling. It was an unpleasant trip--I had to ration the iPhone's battery--I felt cranky and couldn't relax cuz my Plan A pooped out and I had no Plan B. ARGH! I'm not about to let that happen again!----------------PLAN B----------------Now I have Plan B: EZOPower (Universal; Anker) 10000mAh battery.EZOPower (Universal; Anker) I've had it a few days. I rate it A+ (*****). However, the instructions are horrible, sucky, crappy, awful, abysmal, despicable (you get the idea); the manufacturer couldn't bother hiring a decent English translator; I feel the manufacturer threw me into the deep end of the pool without my first learning how to swim. Yesterday I tried to (re)charge my iPhone--nothing happened (unbeknownst to me, the EZOPower (Universal; Anker) was OFF; no blue lights shone)--I didn't realize it mattered that the EZOPower (Universal; Anker) be turned ON--the few lines of instructions the "manual" gave were undecipherable.-------------TEST 1-------------Accidentally having turned ON the EZOPower (Universal; Anker)(by pressing the center silver button where the blue lights/buttons were lit), the battery (re)charged my iPhone perfectly, while I had it playing music, in an unknown "fast" amount of time (I wasn't paying attention cuz I didn't know "ON" mattered). This means: make sure that if you're trying to (re)charge something, ***the blue lights must be ON (aka LIGHTED UP).***To turn the EZOPower (Universal; Anker) OFF (no blue lights), press the silver button--the battery doesn't shut off immediately--there is a short delay.Haven't tried it on my iPad (1) or iPod Touch. I'll post more when I know more. So far, this is a great battery.------------------------------TEST 2: NEXT DAY------------------------------I had iPhone and iPad (1) (re)charging at the same time, with the iPhone playing music. (I don't know why I had the iPhone playing music.) iPhone battery was down to 20%; iPad (1) battery was dead.2-hour mark (re)charging using EZOPower / Universal / Anker. Result: iPhone 91%. iPad (1): 23%. EZOPower / Universal / Anker: down to one blue light (of four). Maybe the iPhone playing music was too much for the EZOPower / Universal / Anker. It doesn't seem to matter which device is connected to "OUT 1" and "OUT S."3-hour mark (re)charging: iPhone is 100%; iPad (1) 39%; EZOPower (Universal; Anker) still has one blue light on. I detached the iPhone.3.5-hour mark (re)charging: iPad (1) 58%; EZOPower (Universal; Anker) one blue light blinking (which means it needs to get plugged in).The EZOPower (Universal; Anker) needs to be plugged in.When I plugged the iPad (1) into the "OUT S" port, the iPad showed "NOT CHARGING"; iPad doesn't recognize the OUT S port.I recommend it without caveat.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005NGKR54" id="B005NGKR54-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-08:</strong> I bough this Anker Astro3 10000mAh for my trip to Disney..and was very happy using it...never let mine & my wifes phone out of power...works excellently with our Sprint SGS2...CONS:  The connector to the Phone's Micro USB pin snapped..and is now unusable...Will contact Anker...let's see what they do about it...Other than the snapped up Micro USB pin...WONDERFUL PRODUCT....Highly Recommend...</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005NGKR54" id="B005NGKR54-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-02:</strong> I bought two of the same product a while back in November and have been loving the one that I opened up.

Of course, pick up an external battery pack. You can charge everything with this (almost). PSP, cell phone, tablet, bluetooth speaker, and the list goes on and on.

Although I could have bought a second battery for mycell phone, the process of removing the back and swapping batteries is too much of a hassle.  Plus, the battery costs as much as this unit and is a one-trick pony - it is just another battery for my cell phone. However, I read the reviews on this Anker unit and saw pretty good reviews overall.  I also noticed that this particular unit came with all the adapters that I would need (except the newest, small Apple connector used on the IPad 4).  So, I thought this might be a better purchase as it would give me the ability to charge my phone multiple times, or charge up my phone, my IPod and, to a certain extent, my tablet.  Very helpful on roadtrips.  I used it for the first time and charged up my IPod (uses the previous Apple connector) as well as my Google 7' tablet.  Both were not fully discharged and, in fact, the tablet just needed to be topped off.  However, The Anker charged both units and only dropped down to 75% power remaining.  The unit appears to be well made and looks very good, although a bit on the heavy side, although not too heavy.  It is about the same size as a larger smart phone and 3 times as thick.  It has a set of 4 lights that tell you how much energy is left in the unit as it discharges.  My one negative comment is similar to others, and that is the instructions.  They are a bit sketchy at best and don't even tell you how to shot off the unit - quick press of power button or hold until lights turn off?  By the way, Anker also sells a similar unit with the same 10,000mAh capacity for $10 cheaper on Amazon, but it does not have the vast amount of connectors.  I plan on using this unit for a long time and am not sure what connectors I will need in the future, so this model provided me with all that I would need, except the newest Apple connector, as mentioned above.  However, you can always use the cable that comes with the charger for the IPad and plug it into this unit.  Very nice!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005NGKR54" id="B005NGKR54-review19" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-23:</strong> I like this one because it has 2 ports and fast charging.

If you are on the go, you likely may even need more than one external battery for your devices. For me, they are priceless.While most external charges like this require you to charge the battery pack itself first from your computer, this allows you multiple options to charge this before you carry it as a spare charges...I've been in the corner of a ballroom charging up my camera during a long wedding with a battery pack and now I can also charge the battery pack the same way while I"m using my phone. (at an outlet in any room or cruise cabin or whataever.)I have one car that has the charger broken so if I travel in it while using my cell or GPS I'm always at risk. I wound up keeping an external charger totally in there for that reason a good deal of the time...so this is actually my second. And this baby is on the go as much as the first.It's built solid and strong, yet compact enough for a pocket.  On trips where you need a laptop, cell, maybe a GPS, maybe a video camera, need to play movies or TV, let kids play while on the go with your cell ipod...Once you have one you have no idea how you went without it.And what it does is awesome...it actually adds 40 hours of time I can use my iphone.Airplanes run down a tablet battery sooo quickly....this means you watch movies and play and never have to worry about your battery or be plugged in ever again.It has 2 USB ports, it charges FAST, you can charge a few things at once...and it pays for itself in loss of frustration. You are simply never without a charge again.And you can be anywhere and not need to ask if you can charge your phone or computer in their socket..just take this out and plug in your device, and you ARE charged. And that's really needed on trips when you CANT stop and charge a camera or computer out and about at times.Well made, real metal rather than cheap plastic made to look like metal...I've not had any problems with it yet.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005NGKR54" id="B005NGKR54-review24" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-04:</strong> Did exactly what it said it would do.

If you're someone who's ever been out traveling for any sort of reason with out a way to recharge your gadgets that normally need a USB connection of some sort (this is especially your cellphone [or even smartphone], mp3 player, camera, etc.) then you would probably want to consider this.  My manager had another brand, Mophie, which was great as during the flight there and even at the expo I he and I could charge our items (I had just my cellphone but he had his iPhone and then iPad mini) without worrying about nearby plugs being used by other conventioneers.  His model had two USB ports like this but was about 6000mAh and was about double the price!!!  I like how the Anker can switch from 12v to 9v as I didn't realize there some products may not charge correctly otherwise.  Would recommend this for the value even though this is bigger (think two iPhones stacked on each other).  Highly recommend this if portable power AND price are a factor.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005NGKR54" id="B005NGKR54-review31" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-01:</strong> Astro 3 external battery by Anker is the most powerful, versatile and reliable external battery that I've come across. It has met or exceeded most of my expectations for such a device. I would strongly recommend it as a travel backup battery for most small electronic devices, tablet and netbook computers.***** The Specs *****This 10,000 mAh battery has one DC 5V 1A input, two USB outputs, and one output for a variety of power outlets. The output voltage can be set on either 9V or 12V, although you can also charge devices that take 5V. One of the USB outputs is designed with the iPad in mind, while the other one is intended for Samsung Galaxy S tablet. The specified input charging time is 6-7 hours, and in my own test I've verified this to be an accurate estimate. The total number of rechargings is specified to be 500, but for obvious reasons I've not been able to test this claim.***** Battery Capacity *****At 10,000 mAh, Astro3 is the largest-capacity external battery that I've ever tested. It has enough capacity to charge an iPhone or any similar small electronic device at least a three times. For a less power-hungry device (plain vanilla cell phone, Kindle, etc.) you can expect to get many full charges from this battery. The two USB charging outputs have different charging rates, but either one will be able to charge your device in a two to three hours max. I have tested the charger with Morolar Razr, Motoroal Krzr, Amazon's third and fourth generation Kindle, iPhone 3G, iPhone 4S, and the first generation iPad. It performed more than adequately with all of those devices.In order to get a good, intuitive feel for the charge capacity of this external battery I subjected it to the "iPad test." That is, I try charging my first generation iPad form the fully discharged state in order to see how much "juice" am I able to get. iPad is the largest electronic device that I can think of that would still qualify (barely) into the small-electronics category. The verdict: I was able to fully charge my iPad without completely depleting the battery. This is the first such battery that I've tested that has passed this test. It took this battery about two hours to charge it to this level. This means that you'll be able to watch several movies on a trans-oceanic flight and still be able to use your iPad when you land.***** Accessories *****The battery comes with a built-in power adapter, two USB cords, and about twenty or so different tips for various small electronic devices. This versatility of adapter heads means that you'll be able to use this battery with most cellphones and small electronic devices that are popular right now, including all of the Apple's iOS devices. I wish that the battery came with a small carrying bag or a pouch to put all these accessories in, as I find myself losing these kinds of accessories more often than I care to admit.***** Design and Build *****The battery sports a slick cool design, and it looks and feels very modern. It doesn't feel cheep, and it will definitely not look out of place with the latest and coolest electronic gizmos. It's fairly heavy, so I'd not recommend carrying it in your pocket, purse or even an iPad case.***** The Bottom Line *****If you are a frequent traveler and carry more than one small electronic device with you all the time, or tend to go on longer trips to places without an easy access to a wall outlet (camping, long flights) then this charger is a must for you. It will keep all of your devices charged for a reasonably long periods of time, and it will give you a peace of mind that you'll never be in a situation where you run out of power. Astro 3 battery is compact and durable, and it will serve well all of your portable charging needs. On the other hand if you don't need to carry too many devices, or your devices are on the small side, then I'd recommend that you check out eitherAnker Astro,Anker Astro2or theIncredicharge I-5000battery. I find those to be more than sufficient for most of my traveling needs.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005NGKR54" id="B005NGKR54-review32" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-04:</strong> I obtained this charger with the goal of charging my TF201 with its 12v port.  I had to buy a USB gender changer as others had recommended.  When I hooked it up, it failed to work.  However, when I worked with the cables I found that one of the connectors needed to hook it up to the TF201 seemed to have an intermittent connection.  If I held the connector just right, it would charge.  The connection is tricky as it takes two of the provided cables plus the connector and then the gender changer to get it to connect to the TF201.  The vendor was very nice, however, and provided me with a new connector and now it charges the TF201 just fine.  I'm not sure of the total charge time and capacity, but it is great for topping off the TF201 tablet.The variety of other connectors make this a very adaptable charger for a variety of phones and devices.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005NGKR54" id="B005NGKR54-review33" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-27:</strong> I did my due research on these types of devices prior to buying and narrowed it down to this Anker and theNew Trent iCarrier 12000mAh Heavy Duty 2A/1A Dual USB Ports External Battery Packs. I eventually selected the Anker as it had more reviews and a pretty impressive rating of 4.5 stars. I did peruse the 1-star reviews just to see if there was anything of any note but came away seeing mostly folks who didn't know to remove both film covers from the top of the device, so Anker it was! I followed the initial charging directions and for the first 5.5 weeks all was well. However, after charging it this past weekend, I didn't attempt to use it again until two days later, Monday, when I discovered it was already down to 2 lights. I thought that was odd but didn't immiediately think anything was wrong until I tried to charge my Jambox and the Astro3 immediately shut off. I tried charging it again, thinking perhaps the Jambox was drawing too much power, but that's when I discovered that the Astro3 now isn't charging at all. I've tried different outlets (at work AND home) and the same thing occurs: it will appear to charge with the four lights lighting in succession, then after about 1-2 minutes the entire unit powers off. I'm sorely disappointed as normally I don't have issues with products that I've researched. There *are* a few 1-star reviews stating the unit didn't last long, but TWO MONTHS?? Of course, it's outside of Amazon's return period so I'm stuck with a $60 paper weight. O Joy.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005NGKR54" id="B005NGKR54-review34" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-23:</strong> First impression out of the box, this is by far the best portable charger of this capacity on the market. I have tried a ton of different portable chargers ranging from 2500mAh to 300Wh, and this one is truly the best 10,000mAh range out there. No surprise as the Astro 2 is the best in ITS class (although, I don't think there are many 8400mAh chargers out there, so I'll even include it with everything below 8400 and it's still the best, and not just because of its capacity).First of all, it has two output ports. You may say whoopdie do. But I have had other ones even with THREE outputs, yet you could only use one at a time??? If you plugged two in at the same time, either one port would shut down, or it would split the amperage between the ports. Actually, I take that back, this DOES have three ports, it's just that the third one isn't a USB port, further expanding on this thing's capability and diversity. I've never seen a charger in this class (as far as capacity) that can charge a laptop?? That's pretty amazing. I have a 300Wh charger that equates to about 84,000mAh that charges laptops, but a 10,000mAh charger that charges laptops is awesome. It's a small charge relative to the 300Wh, but enough to charge a laptop with a standard battery two times over, or one with an extended life battery, one full charge.Secondly it comes with it's own wall wart. Not that big of a deal, but a lot of portable chargers out there don't include them. Only thing I don't like is that it's only 1000mAh. I take that back, It's not that the wall wart is 1000mAh that bugs me, but that the input is 1000mAh. Although this is pretty much standard for most chargers, the Astro 2 has a 1500mAh input.  Not that big of a deal, it just adds a couple more hours to the charge time of this device. I was surprised to see this because the Astro's are kind of known for their high output and input current. That gets to my second point: the output current.This is definitely something that hasn't changed from the Astro 2. It has a 2A output on BOTH usb ports (again, that actually work at the same time!). And again, I haven't found a charger yet (other than the astro 2) that can actually, efficiently, charge two items at the same time. And these chargers' outputs are only 1A. This not only charges both at the same time, but maintains 2A on both ports.This is also extremely light and portable. I expected it to be a lot heavier, but it is light as a feather! In fact, I think it's even lighter than the astro 2's. It's size is what is expected for a 10,000mAh charger. Someone mentioned it was the size of an iphone...that's kind of pushing it, but it is indeed very compact. You could maybe fit it into your pocket, but it's about all you'd be able to fit into your pocket. If you have a jacket pocket, it's a perfect match! Again, you have to put things into perspective and remember it's a 10,000mAh battery. Another 10,000mAh I purchased, that ended up having a port go out after just a few months, weighed probably 3 times as much. I'm almost tempted to have this just replace the Astro 2's I have, but I just love the astro 2's too much as well! I guess over all, Anker just makes high quality chargers and they seem to take everything into consideration. Oh, and don't forget an 18 month warranty. That is pretty awesome seeing as how any L-ion battery usually dies (or severely starts to degrade) after about year regardless of frequency of use. Where most companies are giving a year warranty, just enough time for your battery to start to go bad and for them to say, "Sorry, warranty's up...," Anker apparently seems to be saying, "We want to make sure that you'll be covered long enough to get a new one once it starts to degrade." CLEARLY customer oriented as opposed to warrantying something literally just for the expected life of the product, and then failing right after the warranty expires. As soon as I saw the 18 months, I knew immediately they really were looking out to go BEYOND the expected life of the product.Anyway, if I could give more than 5 stars I would. And not just for the Astro 3, but all of the Astro series chargers. Anker is truly amazing.UPDATE: I almost forgot, a lot of other chargers, for whatever reason especially 10,000mAh chargers, do NOT charge while they are being charged. May seem redundant, but there are definitely reasons why one would want to charge this while it was charging something else. But anyway, THIS ONE DOES charge while being charged...so, just wanted to update one more awesome thing about this charger.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005NGKR54" id="B005NGKR54-review35" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-01:</strong> I love this thing.  It's a bit bigger than a deck of cards, not very heavy, and will charge at least 4-5 devices before it needs recharging.  I'm not totally in love with the glossy, mirrored front face (it scratches easily and cracks appeared over one of the blue charge lights) but overall it feels rugged without being heavy or cumbersome.  The exception to this might be the little 9/12V slider switch on the right side, which powers the aux (non-USB) charging port, but I don't use that port for anything right now anyway.  The bag full of charging adapters is nice.  I travel a lot and use this to keep my phones and tablet charged during (and immediately after) flights, bus rides, and whatnot.

You have to go to your device manufacturer and get the info from them on what voltage your device should charge at. the face of the device is a major smudge magnet, and they recommend not using a protector on it. The &#34;power&#34; button only shows charge and doesn't seem to really turn it off or on. It is not meant for more than one of the same kind of device. one port is for iphones and the other for android.

For $50 plus free shipping, you won't find that many deals as good as this one. It arrived promptly within 5 days, and inside the box I found a lot of nice adapter heads for various devices, even laptops; only wish they had one for my Toshiba laptop :3Anyway, upon opening the box, I was presented with the battery, the charger for it, a bunch of adapter heads, some extension cables, and the instruction manual; luckily they did the right thing by listening to their customers and had a properly written instruction leaflet. The battery itself was already almost fully charged, it took me less than an hour to charge the remaining capacity, and I immediately used it to charge some of my gadgets.When I first started charging, the 4th indicator light disappeared. I thought maybe the 4th light is the indicator of a full charge of the battery (100%), nothing to worry about.===============Testing Data===============NOTE:* My phone is an Android phone (Samsung Exhibit II 4G) with a 1600mAh battery.* My PSP is a PSP-2000 with a 1200mAh battery (actual capacity is degraded to 655mAh due to long-term usage [about 4 years now]).* All devices are powered on while charging, which means they take power WHILE they are charging.==========First Full Charge/Cycle (Some Detail)==========1. My phone fully 2 times - Ends with 3 LED lights on2. My iPod touch 4G from 70% to 100% - Ends with 3 LED lights on3. My phone fully - Ends with 2 LED lights on4. My phone from ~30% to 50% - Ends with 2 LED lights on5. My phone fully - Ends with 1 LED light on6.

My PSP from 0% to 19% (~125mAh) - In 15 minutes - Ends with 0 LED light on@. Total Charging Capacity: ~8000mAh + The capacity taken to power the devices while charging=======================================Now for the list of pros and cons!==========Pros==========* Large capacity (10000mAh)* Easy to use, convenient, and portable.* High output current (2 Amps), which means you'll be able to charge devices such as the iPad.* Charges from outlet! A lot of low-end external power banks charge using USB connection, which takes FOREVER due to low current (probably .5 Amp).* Includes variety of adapters, you'll probably find one for each of your devices. Check out the product image for detail of the adapters.* Can charge laptops! Although I haven't been able to test that because it didn't come with an adapter compatible with my laptop.* Charge 2 devices at once! Beware though, battery may discharge a lot faster if too much power is being drawn from it at one time.* Doesn't get hot while charging, unlike many other power banks.* Auto shutoff after devices have been fully charged.* LED indicator lights* Beautiful design* Easy to understand instructions leaflet.* Great support from Anker!==========Cons==========* Charger for the battery only inputs 1 Amp, a 2 Amp charger would charge it much faster.* The power button can't be used to manually turn off the battery when devices are plugged in.Overall, I think the battery is the best bang for your bucks. Other power banks cost around $60-$80, while this one costed only $50, and performs very well.The only things that confuses me were the USB output ports; I wanted to make sure to use the appropriate ports for my devices, to lose as least amount of power as possible while discharging. the instruction manual says port S is for tablets, while port I is for phones and small gadgets. Although some users said they were unable to charge their iPads using port S, so they used port I. I guess it wouldn't be that important, since the specs indicate that they both output the same amount of Amps and Voltage. I will update my review if something changes.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005NGKR54" id="B005NGKR54-review42" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-06:</strong> Very well built unit by that i mean feels heavy and sturdy.

Some of the others do not suppy enough power for the iPhone5 (did work for older versions).  Some do not have enough capacity to charge the iPhone5 fully or more than once.  This unit is larger than many, but it Works for my iPhone(s), iPad (full and mini), and other odd devices.  In 6 months of regular usage, it still seems to work well with no obvious loss in capacity (just a feeling - no scientific measurement made).  I am not sure why one should have to turn it on to use it (other lower-powered extenders sense when power is being drawn and switch on automatically - effectively).  Maybe the problem here is that the 9V/12V option requires an inverter and hence needs a switch - with my use mostly being the USB output, the switch is one more thing to remember when plugging something in - small quibble, I admit...</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005NGKR54" id="B005NGKR54-review45" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-18:</strong> I'm an electronic engineer and I'm a little disappointed in the lack of useful and reliable information about this pack.  After three full charge-discharge cycles, the pack is stable in its capacity, though significantly lower than what was rated by about 15%.  That's too much.First of all, the 10,000 mAh rating is misleading.  They should give the Watt-hour rating instead, because you don't know what voltage the mAh rating corresponds to.  If it's 5V, it's a lot.  But no, they rated it at the LOWEST possible voltage rating to get the highest mAh figure.  They used the 3.7V low-margin figure for the LiIon cell.  (A LiIon battery discharges from 4.2V down to 3.7V and then dies rapidly.  An accurate average is 3.9 or 4.0V.  But that would have given them a mAh rating of only 9250mAh, not as impressive as 10,000mAh.)So the rated capacity is 37Wh (from the owner's manual).After three full cycles, I get a consistent capacity of 31.5 Wh.  That's 8500mAh at 3.7V, to normalize it to their published figure in this product description on Amazon.  I have a Polaroid portable DVD player that draws a consistent and exact 1A at 9V, and it's very easy to measure.Anker, if you think I got a bad pack and want to replace it, please let me know by a comment here.  If I can get a good pack within about a week, I'll buy a second one for a long plane flight that we're taking (to keep my kids occupied with movies).  But 3.5 hours on a charge isn't even enough for 2 movies on this player.  I was counting on at least 4 hours, which it would have done easily at 37 Wh.I also don't like the capacity-meter lights.  They turn off at the rate of about 1/2 hr for each of the first three, then the last one goes for 1.75 hours which makes them pretty useless.  I would guess that instead of using a coulomb-counter battery "gas gauge" chip, they just measured the battery terminal voltage which is not only inaccurate and varies significantly between batches of batteries, it also changes as the battery ages and so becomes even less accurate.Despite my criticisms of the rated capacity and battery meter, it's a good pack overall and I'm not going to return it unless Anker is confident they can meet the 37Wh rating.  I've given it 4 stars because at 31.5Wh/8500mAh, it's still a good deal for the money, and appears to have good quality of design and construction.  And for this class of pack to have both 5V AND 9V outputs is very convenient.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005NGKR54" id="B005NGKR54-review46" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-06-04:</strong> The Anker Astro3 is a sleek, and powerful external battery pack.

After recently buying the Nexus 7, I was impressed with the battery life of the tablet, but I really wanted an additional option for charging.  Finding an open outlet in an airport can be hit or miss sometimes and for trips where you are walking around a city, staying at an outlet for any amount of time is not possible.  Even if you find yourself with a USB outlet at your seat onboard the aircraft, they usually charge your device so slowly.  Using the included MicroB cable, this battery charged my Nexus 7 in sleep mode from 50% to 100% in about 2 hours.  I still had over 50% power left in the Anker battery after doing this.  Most of the smaller capacity battery's I have tried would have no power left after tackling such a feat.The value this battery pack provides is with the accessories that are included.  In the package they include a USB mini cable, a spring wire with 12 different tips that can be used with different phones and tablets, a DC power wire, 6 different tips for use with a variety of computers and netbooks, an AC wall charger and a pouch for storage.  This is perfect for those who want peace of mind that they don't have to go searching for a cable to charge their device with the Anker.This external battery has two USB outlets, a DC output and an input for charging the external battery. The two USB outlets are designed independently to accommodate specific Apple and Android device charging requirements.  One outlet is designed with circuits custom to Apple devices and the other is designed to work specifically with all 5V/2A devices.  The USB outlets can be used to charge either/or, however it will take longer to charge an Apple device if you use the outlet not specifically designed for Apple products. The included user guide is clear on which outlets work in what way.The positives:-All of the included accessory parts to ensure you can charge your device-Huge capacity for charging tablets and multiple devices at one timeNeutral-Unit is a bit bulky however for the size it doesn't weigh too much-no built-in led light for use as flashlightCONS:- Blue LED lights on the front stay on during charging- Difficult to turn it on or off; I found that just pressing the unit power button would not usually turn the power bank on but rather holding the button for a few seconds would and turning it off was somewhat cumbersome as well with multiple seconds until the unit would appear to shut down and the pressing the button and holding it again until the unit finally turned offOverall, I think this is a great product. It's very powerful and charges my devices quickly and usually still has additional power left to charge them again.

And part of it involves keeping my electronics running.I've used Energizer's XPal 18000 external battery, a bunch of Duracell's pocket friendly externals, I have the GOAL0 Elite solar panel, and a few other no-name battery brands.Energizer's XPAL 18000 is by far the highest capacity battery I've used. I was able to get away with charging it once a month. For trips I wouldn't even need to bring the charger. However, the sheer size of it made it problematic when traveling. And that I didn't use up the full charge pointed out I didn't need the full capcity.Enter Anker's 10k mAh battery.It's moderately priced at $60, contending with other brands. Like many models, this offers 4 LED's for power levels, however there are two USB ports with different output capabilities, and you are able to set the output at 9V and 12V. It comes with a 3 year warranty. Energizer's XPal, being an older model, does not have these functions (though it can power laptops.. which I no longer use)Using this, I was able to power up smaller high-consumption devices, such as a portable 7" monitor. I may even be able to adapt several cables to let this unit charge via solar power using my Goal0, but that remains to be seen.So far I've only charged the unit once. My phone runs hot while charging, however it does charge. My other devices charge as well, and so far my power indicator shows half the charge remaining, which is great.I'd say go for this external battery if you're in need. It's versatile and has a high capacity, great for phones and emergencies. I take away one star due to the perceived fragility (can't withstand drops/water), the unit is thicker than I had expected, and my phone runs warm/hot whenever charging (which is not the case when charging via wall-plug, etc). I would buy this item again in a heartbeat, and am very pleased with my unit, which will travel with me for an 8 month excursion through the Philippines.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005NGKR54" id="B005NGKR54-review56" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-17:</strong> I bought this external battery charger after reading numerous reviews on here. It's pretty much just like what most reviewers have said so I will spare you the regurgitation.I've used this many times over the past 2 weeks but yesterday the adapter that connects my samsung galaxy s3 phone to the USB cord broke. I didn't do anything to it besides unplug it from my phone and it snapped off. Either I'm the next coming of Wonder Woman with my ultimate sheer strength or this thing wasn't made of high quality.Overall, the product works great. But the adapter is flimsy. I'm not sure where I can get another one. Now I'm left with a useless brick. And I'm not impressed.UPDATED:Anker contacted me the same day I posted my review to make things right. They said they would send me a new part to replace the broken one. Now that's what I call great customer service! I was pleasantly surprised to find out they actually read reviews on here. They definitely stand behind their products. And I will do business with them again. In light of all that, I felt compelled to bump up the stars. They get an A for effort.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005NGKR54" id="B005NGKR54-review57" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-18:</strong> works really well. solid build!!

It is about time that a company finally put out a reliable device that can charge multiple portable electronic devices properly. The unit is well built and hi-tech looking. It comes with every type of adapter so that it can be plugged up to the most used electronic consumer products on the market.The unit has a black rubberized coating, mirror face and has a chrome plastic stripe around the side of the unit's case. It has 4 blue round LED lights on its face which indicate its charging status. The ON/OFF round silver button is also located on the screen between the blue LEDs.Out of the box the Astro3 screen is covered by a very thin protective coating that can be removed. Many reviewers thought their screens were scratched but this is not so. The instructions are simply written but clear enough to understand how to use the power bank correctly.The power bank has 2 USB outputs and an output port to charge 9 and 12 volt electronic devices. The chrome sliding switch on the side is used to switch the current to 9 or 12 volts. The voltage status is indicated in "red" on the right lower side of the screen. The 2 USB ports can charge any 5 Volt device which includes most cell phones that have micro charging inputs. The out port labeled "I" charges iPads, iPods, iTouches, iPhones and other cell phone devices as well as the Sony PSP 2000 & 3000 hand held game models. The USB output labeled "S" charges the Samsung Galaxy Tab. The power bank is charged up by an AC adapter that is included with the unit. When you see 4 lit blue round LEDs you will know that the unit is fully charged.  The unit also will shutdown after 30 seconds from when the unit is fully charged. The Astro3 also goes into a power saving mode after 30 seconds of inactivity.I used this power bank to charge my LG Rumor Touch phone and PSP 2000 Slim. It charged both up within 2 hours and expended only 1 blue dot of energy.This power bank is great in case of an electrical power failure. The Anker Astro3 power bank can keep cellphones and iPads going for hours until electric is restored. This Anker product is backed by a company that is very concerned about how their products perform and encourage consumers to send them feed back about the products they bought. They will also replace this power bank within 18 months if found defective under its warranty.I will be updating this review in the near future in order to comment on its durability and ability to properly charge the 2 new iPads I bought.Based on my initial 2 day use, I highly recommend this product!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005NGKR54" id="B005NGKR54-review59" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-06-21:</strong> With all the gadgets we take with us on our  family trips, this was a real life saver.

Camera batteries are not normally an issue but streaming music is.  I don't wear headphones when I'm shooting for safety reasons so I always rely on my iphone's external speaker.  Between that and the streaming data, I'm dead in an hour or two.  Not anymore.  Thanks to the astro 3, I am not concerned.  In fact, the last thing I worry about now is whether or not I'll be around an outlet.  Having the USB ports and a bunch of included connectors means that I can use this with every device I own.  VERY CONVENIENT.  I almost bought the anker  astro 2 but the extra boost and minimal price difference lead me to the astro 3.  It came to me fully charged.  Anyone who said this is the size of an external hard drive is 100% correct.  You can still fit it in a jean or jacket pocket.  I have a gadget holster and it slides in there perfectly.I also plan on shooting some time lapse work later this year and need a solid power source for multiple hours in remote locations.  What can I say that hasn't already been said?  If you think this might help you, stop wondering and just buy it.

I've tried other universal battery packs but found this one to work with a wider range of devises and charged faster.Taking it out the box, I noted scratches on the face but removing the thin and barely noticeable protective skin solved that issue.  I used the wall charger (plugging into the input) to power up the battery and it was good to use after a few hours.  It easily charged my Kindle devises, iPad, iPhone and SONY netbook.  There are 18 different adapters to cover just about any devise which makes it very universal (I've bought charging kits touted as universal but limited to top selling brands).  You need to find the adapter that fits your specific devise and plug it into either directly into the OUTPUT for laptops (DC) or the usb connection wire and then power on to begin charging.  There is a toggle button on the side to switch between 9V and 12V and the red light moves up and down to indicate which voltage is being used.It measures 3 x 5, is 3/5" thick and has a little weight to it but convenient enough to carry around (if needed).  I store 3 adapters with required connection in a travel pouch and throw it into my purse for traveling. This battery allows for 3 devices to be charged at once (two by usb ports and one DC).  I've tried two devices at once and the charge was smooth and just as fast as charging solo but sucked the life out of the battery quickly.  The usb port labeled "OUT S" works for Samsung and the usb port labeled "OUT I" works for apple devises and they are not interchangeable so you need to pay attention when plugging those devises in but other devises seem to work whichever usb port you use to charge.My only complaint was that I wished the adapters were numbered to make it easier to recognize with which devise it works.  I solved this issue by marking the adapters with a permanent marker.I found this battery pack to be very universal and a bargain at the price.  I use it ALL the time to charge my devises away from home.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005NGKR54" id="B005NGKR54-review65" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-04:</strong> Great power supply.

It charged my phone about 8% before shutting off, 50% should have been at least 2-3 charges for an iphone.I plugged it in as soon as I got home and let it charge over night.

All the tips and connections you could ask for, almost to the point of overwhelming. The plug connector for the tips are universal so if you had other chargers in the past that utilize the tip exchanges, then you may be able to interchange the tips.The main reason I purchased the battery is for it's 12V capabilities. I am very capable of making my own cables, but it would have been nice to have a car charger as I am on the road for days sometimes without the ability to recharge in the hotel, OR I want to charge in the car while camping for an extended time, OR I want to recharge via solar while camping. The 12V 1A input uses another universally used plug, that other vendors have chosen to power their devices and it is possible to create the car charger with Anderson connectors and such, but having the 5V, 9V and 12V output is really the strengths of this device, not withstanding its 10,000 mAh capacity. If anyone has already found a 12V 1A car charger, then I would certainly be interested in knowing about it.Edit--- Solved my own problem. There is the yellow tip that fits on the flexible USB cable supplied that fits into the power in of the Anker. I use my Transformer tablet USB FOB car charger and plug into that and it charges fine.

I have an S4 and a Galaxy Note 8.0 tablet (on AT&T; 4G LTE) with 2600 mAh and 4600 mAh respectively and let me tell you, WOW... just wow. I can charge the note 8.0 tablet a full charge and the S4 twice brfore I need to recharge the Anker Pro.. Paired with a Trident Electra power case for the S4, my phone is now pretty much impossible to die and I can go on for days without needing an outlet.This was a review of the Anker Pro 10,000 mAh. Highly recommend to anyone and for almost any device out there.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005NGKR54" id="B005NGKR54-review89" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-03:</strong> This solves all your power issues while traveling with friends, family and with Tablets.  If you are like me, it takes a few days before my tablet loses its battery power so I typically don't charge it up daily like I would my phone.  The Astro3 is a handy power device that will recharge 2 devices at the same time.  I had it recharge my IPAD 2 from 0 to 100% and it still had power remaining to charge my SG3 with its OEM battery.  It also is shipped with various connectors so you should find one that fits your needs.Anker support is also very helpful.  The USB spring power wire that came with the Astro3 was working intermittently and they  helped me by replacing it with a plain power wire that was in the Astro 5600 at my request.  I'm a very satisfied customer and very happy with all the Anker products I've purchased.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005NGKR54" id="B005NGKR54-review90" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-15:</strong> My friend has one of these and I had to borrow it on a trip.

We went over ways to make it work better and how the product works. After that, the rep offered to send me a newer model at no charge. AMAZING. They sent me the Astro 3E and it is great.

This tablet uses 12V and an unusual "nokia style" charging tip. there are a few batteries out there that meet ONE of these requirements but only 1 other that meets both.The other is quite pricey and has doesn't have the quality control that Anker has. After several discussions with customer service at laptopmate I went ahead and ordered this battery (again). This time I didn't attempt to use the included nokia connectors (they don't fit together with the cables correctly to fit in the Xoom-the reason Ireturned the first time I ordered). I instead obtained a 2nd DC charging cable and made my own Xoom charging cable.Wait, don't leave it isn't that hard. I cut the cable with about 3 inches of wire from the plug. I did the same thing with an extra Xoom power cordMotorola Standard Dock and Power for MOTOROLA XOOM (Motorola Retail Packaging)I picked up here. then I connected red-red and black-black. Done.it works perfectly. I can now charge my xoom with this battery separately or a cool unintended bonus ---from the cradle, making it easier to use while it charges.I'm only on my 2nd full charge with the Astro 3. The first charge from 0%-100% took about 3 hours and drained the astro 3. the 2nd charge took &lt;2hrs and allowed me to charge 0-100% then 80-100% before going dead. I'm betting after a few more charge cycles I settle out about 1.5 charges of the Xoom for every charge on the Astro 3.great battery pack. if it does this for my power picky xoom i can't imagine how easily it would handle my kids ipads.buy it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005NGKR54" id="B005NGKR54-review100" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-20:</strong> Great size.

If you are only looking to emergency-charge your cell phone or such, then there are tons of alternatives out there. But being able to change the voltages (to 9 or 12v as well as the standard 5v USB) makes this battery extremely useful as a portable power solution for tons of devices on the market. The amperage draw is important. This device can handle a full 2amp draw (total, so if you are connecting two devices they cant both pull 2 amps). The included connectors are about perfect for a myriad of devices. I can easily charge my Samsung smartphone (GalaxyNexus) and a tablet (Note10.1) simultaneously.One of the main uses i get from the battery is powering portable speaker systems. For example, the battery will power the Creative T20 or the Logitech wireless boombox perfectly (the latter with full power sound, rather than the diminished sound when using its own poor builtin battery). Both of these speakers even work with the included coax power cord included with this battery and with the proper polarity! Im sure other devices may also, but please be aware you should always check polarity for your intended device first.I can also use this battery in the field to charge other batteries, including RC models, and photo equipment, as well as powering flashes, ham radios, scanners, etc.The one problem i have encountered is the auto-power off system. I've built several custom speaker systems using a T-amp (a very efficient small stereo audio amplifier) which even though the system is playing, at very low volumes the battery will power itself down after several seconds. If the draw is higher (at higher volume) it is fine, but i wish the circuitry was at a user-adjustable sensitivity or just at a lower threshold so it could be used with very low drain circuits and not power off...other than than one gripe, this is an utterly amazing and versatile battery capable of so many uses other than just recharging cell phones!Seems solidly built, is very small and powerful for its features.Be aware that the voltage regulator does use power in itself, so the useful amp-hours (the stated 10,000 mAh) are diminished some when upconverting voltage, but this is a small price to pay for such a highly useful feature.Highly recommended without question!!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005NGKR54" id="B005NGKR54-review103" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-05:</strong> I bought this unit to provide power for a portable transceiver requiring 12v and for the cell and other devices I carry.

It came a day late and the Anker's box was opened. The device had been clearly returned, it had finger prints all over the sides but only the plastic cover on the top had scratches. (The plastic peels away)My personal experience was not that great, it was too bulky to replace a small USB charger BUT if you are a college student, I would highly recommend it. You could slip it into your backpack and be able to charge in class or on the go.The device did not fill the void I hoped it would. I ended up returning it after the price dropped 20% right after buying it. However, I gave the battery 4 stars because it does hold a considerable charge and does come with a lot of connectors. The build quality seems decent, but the silver band feels a little tacky in my opinion. I took one star off not only because it was clearly used and returned, but because the manual says to not leave devices connected after they are finished charging since the charge circuit may not shut off, causing damage. Even if modern electronics such as phones have overcharge protection, I am not willing to take the risk.Overall, this would be great for the college student, hiker, or someone who isn't near outlets all day. I though it would be useful for me but I am rarely far away from a power source. For $49, it is a decent buy.Edit: After the 20% price drop, I reconsidered purchasing it. Coming from an electronics background, I know a 10,000 mAh battery would be fairly large and expensive. Since this battery is $49, including the charge circuit, case, connectors, and such, the battery is most likely a 3.7v, low discharge rate cell that is being boosted to 5, 9, and 12 volts though a special circuit. In other words, although they advertise 10,000 mAh, it will be less because a lot of that is used up being converted to a voltage, plus the lose involved from the conversion it self. I did not take a star off because I do not have the battery to rip it apart and test it, but it is something the buyer should be aware of. Just because it says 10,000mAh, do not expect it to charge you 1000mAh phone ten times! It will be a lot less due to the way they market the device.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005NGKR54" id="B005NGKR54-review105" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-06-17:</strong> This baby lasted through a whole 21 hour flight trip to keep my Droid 2 juiced so I can watch videos.

This unit holds 10000 mAh, which is going to be more than most other portable chargers you are likely to find at this time. It also offers two different power output settings, 9V -- which you'd use for a smartphone, or 12V--which you'd use for larger devices.  The ports include two USB outputs, optimized for Apple iOS devices and Samsung devices, respectively.  The third output may be used to charge other devices using the included plug tips.  The fourth port is the input plug where you charge the device from the wall. I don't know what they're all for, but there are a bunch of them that will let you charge a variety of devices.  I used it recently on a 13-hour international flight and it worked like a champ to charge my iPhone, iPad and 3DS.  Unfortunately, because of its great functionality and power reserves, it's a bit larger and heavier than many other similar devices on the market but unless you plan to have a very small bag with you, it shouldn't be a deciding factor.  It's about the same size as a mini-hard drive and fit easily into the same size backpack pocket where I'd keep a camera, 3DS or digital recorder.  Feels very sturdy and comes with a mesh carrying case where you can stash the charger and whatever plug tips you're planning to use.  Overall, I'm very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it highly.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005NGKR54" id="B005NGKR54-review107" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-16:</strong> I have to give it to Anker so far.

I've had these cases for three phones, including my Sprint SPH-L900, Galaxy Note II, and it fits perfect. It has taken a few drops, some on tile, but shows no sign of wear from these drops. If I had to add a con, it would be that the screen opening is just a bit smaller, due to the added protection from the "lip" to cover the screen, and the screen protector bubbles up and allows for dust to build up underneath. I have tried two different batches of screen protectors and the both do the same thing.

When it was time to replace it, I bought a different brand for my phone and installed it... then I reattached THIS CASE to see how it would fit... and no problems...  this cover didn't touch my new screen protector, either.

I ordered three of these cases at once because they were on sale at the time (buy two, get one free). I purchased this clear one, teal, and green case. All were individually packaged and were sent very fast. I haven't had them long but I have used this clear case and the green case, they both fit perfectly. When I tested the teal case, it seemed to be shorter on one side, but when I actually use the case, I will update this review. This case and the green all ports: camera, flash, headphones, top and bottom microphone, speaker, volume up/down, power, charger, and stylus are cut perfect and allow easy access. The green case seems to be slightly smaller or something on the phones right side because it tends to slightly mess up my screen protector, but it's not a deal breaker. Overall great cases, cute android on the back, I recommend these cases.**update 1/4/2013**The other cases that I bought at the same time (green and teal) fit great as well. I guess I had to kind of stretch them out and make sure I put either the bottom or top of the phone in first to stretch the case proportionately over the phone.

Trust me you won't be disappointed!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009WDWBH6" id="B009WDWBH6-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-13:</strong> The case was better then I expected, its light weight and have a very snug fit over the Galaxy Note II. personally this is the lightest case I'v used for my Galaxy note II.

I have tried several others that looked promising, but just didn't work (what's not to work on something so simple!).  I have finally found the perfect one in this Cruzerlite.  It's an excellent fit, with cutouts for the operating buttons and all other parts that require access, including the s-pen.It has good grip, as evidenced by the fact, which someone else also mentioned, that it is impossible to slide out of the packaging and must be unwrapped.  It has a slight lip on the front side which is very nice for setting the phone face down, thus protecting the screen.  The android figure on the back is subtle and kind of cute.Because of the 3 for the price of 2 offer, I felt compelled to get 3 colors (clear, green and red, all of which are transparent), and am glad I did.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009WDWBH6" id="B009WDWBH6-review27" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-05:</strong> i love the little android logo on the back of the cover and this clear matches well with my gray note 2. im giving this 4 because when it came, it was a little dirty so yea..</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009WDWBH6" id="B009WDWBH6-review28" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-10:</strong> This case looks and feel great but if you have any kind of screen protector on your screen it will peel it up and off.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009WDWBH6" id="B009WDWBH6-review29" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-09:</strong> Although it served its purpose the finish wasn't as nice as the Body Glove variety.

I have to say this was a great case, however there were 2 things I didn't like about it. Lets go over the good first and then I will get to the things I didn't like. So the case's cutouts for all the ports and buttons were perfectly cut. Nothing was hard to get to. The case fit very well and looked amazing. The android guy on the back was a great touch to the case that I really liked. The case was a bulky one. Obviously nowhere near as bulky as an Otterbox but it did add a fair amount when compared to the Body Glove Dimensions case. The case (white version) also got dirty after about a week of use and no matter how hard I scrubbed or what cleaner I used, the dirt wouldn't come off. I kinda figured the case would get dirty so it didnt bother me as much as it would have bothered other people. Wish it was easier to clean.Overall I think this is a great case and I would recommend it to anyone, just go for a darker color if having a dirty case that you can't clean will drive you crazy.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009WDWBH6" id="B009WDWBH6-review33" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-08:</strong> I bought the clear one for the Note II white .no issues with the S pen or the headphone 3.5mm jack cutout.looks like the old inventory had this issue,but the one I got didn't</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009WDWBH6" id="B009WDWBH6-review34" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-07:</strong> I ordered this because it seemed like a good deal.

The protection is great, the phones have survived drops without a problem and the plastic holds up well.  Despite the extra mm (what whatever it is) it actually makes the phone easier to hold with the ribbed sides.The fit is great, you just have to make sure you line up one of the ends with the connections properly then push it on.  If you don't do that it may not fit well, however that's user error.  If you use a screen protector see below.Drawbacks:The first is likely only an issue for a white Note 2 and is minor and more personal preference.  It just looks a little awkward with the white/silver trim making and a lot of that has to do with the sides blocking you from seeing the trim which breaks up the look of the phone.  However I'm a function over form person so I'm happy with the grippy sides, but just a warning for those who prefer looks first.With the clear &#34;color&#34; if you take the case off and any dust/dirt manages to get in there you see it clearly (pun intended) when looking at the back of your phone and you'll spend time trying to clean the rubber.  If you take your cases off a lot for whatever reason (swap battery, dock, etc) you won't want clear regardless of case maker.If you use a screen protector and how much room it leaves on the edges.  I use the ones the Verizon store sell in those 3-packs.  The first one I put on wasn't lines up right and offset to the left where it covered the screen fine but the case would push against the film's edge and make it come off.  I then put on a second one dead center and have had no problems.  So be aware if you have a screen protector and if it fits from edge to edge it will likely not work well with this case and keep popping off.However if you're fine with this drawbacks going in it is a good product and I plan on continuing to use it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009WDWBH6" id="B009WDWBH6-review40" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-22:</strong> This case is perfect.

It gives enough grip to the phone so that you don't feel like you are going to drop it at any minute. It is ribbed on the left and right side, adding more area for that extra grip while you hold the phone. Because it is TPU, it doesn't pick up lint and dust from your pocket, and even though it provides good grip, it does not get stuck if you slip it in an out of a pocket. All the cut outs match the ports perfectly, and the case does not get in the way of any cables plugged into it. It is also pretty slim, not giving the phone extra significant bulk. The smoke colored case is a perfect match for the the titanium colored Note II.

I like that the sides are slightly thicker than other tpu's I've had in the past for added corner and side drop protection. The phone is big so this keeps the heft down and protects it well. It's good to note that a lot of the cases here don't have corner protection for the corner where the Stylus comes out. This does and it's cheap enough to buy a few colors. The front sticks up past phone far enough to protect the screen very well. Phone fell on its corner just 30 min ago on my hard floors and all is well. Great if you're a pocket phone person. If you're a lady or a Biz man with a case then go for the nice wallet style ones if you like. If you want great, light protection then look no further.OH I don't want to forget to mention that the case is very simple to get off in case you need fast access to battery or something else. huge plus for me</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009WDWBH6" id="B009WDWBH6-review50" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-22:</strong> As I switching carriers and phones, one of the first things I buy is a Cruzerlite TPU case.  This is about the 6th or 7th one, and since it's for the wife's Note 2, it had to be pink.  I'll note she really likes the way the pink case looks with the white version of the Note 2.As always, the fit is perfect, and the cutouts are well-aligned.  For the Note 2, the S-Pen hole can be a little tricky at first, but you get used to it.  I've also noticed a little &#34;oil-slick&#34; effect on the back where the case meets the battery door, but I imagine that will go away with time.Overall, I highly recommend Cruzerlite's cases.  Their TPU cases are durable and stylish, evidently well-made, and worth the few extra dollars.  The few times I've contacted them through Facebook or other means, they've been pleasant to deal with.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B009WDWBH6', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B009WDWBH6', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00C0R3UOO</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00C0R3UOO</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C0R3UOO" id="B00C0R3UOO-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-05:</strong> This is a two piece case, a softer piece on the phone and a harder plastic piece for the outer shell.

We'll I decided to give it a shot, and, WOW!  The case looks great on the HTC One.  I have the silver phone and the black carbon fiber gives a good contrast to the silver grill of the speakers.The case adds more bulk than the TPU cases that are available but it doesn't look ridiculous like some of the other brands that have two part protection.  For it being a two part case I would have to say the the added size is minimal.  To be honest the case adds an even more solid feel to an already sturdy phone.All of the cut-outs are on point. The power button/ir blaster is exposed which is great for the ir functionality.  Be aware that the power button may be more recessed than one may be accustomed to, but since the material surrounding the button is silicone, it is very easy to press inside the recess.  The cut out for the micro USB slot is big enough to accommodate a cord that is larger that the included cord (Palm micro USB). The headphone jack will fit a headphone cord significantly larger than the included ear buds. There is a slight lip around the edge of the phone that will give good face down protection.Overall I would say that with this case you get the best of both worlds. Great protection and a classy, stylish look.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C0R3UOO" id="B00C0R3UOO-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-28:</strong> Good protection and fits the HTC one well.

It consists of two cases, a soft rubber case and an outer hard shell. They fit the phone perfectly and I'm betting it won't fly apart if it were dropped.  The carbon fiber design looks great, there are smoked clear sides which contrast the cf of the back. The case is not "toy'ish". It looks classy and high quality.  Because of the slim nature of the phone itself, this case, despite being two layers, doesn't add much unwanted bulk. It also affords a better grip. The power button, which is difficult to manipulate anyway can be a bit tougher to actuate, however its far easier to locate without looking. All cut outs are where you would expect them. The only thing I would change, I would like a power button like they did the volume rocker, it feels perfect and makes it much easier to manipulate. I realize unless they used a transparent color you would lose the remote function but would enhance triggering the phone. I would recommend this product and seller.

Soft inner layer protects phone from scratches caused by removing the case from the phone.

My only complaint is that the tension on the &#34;jaws&#34; that open to hold the phone is really tight so it's not so easy to get your phone in.  If you have a case with any give in it, the mount will buckle it a little bit.  Not an issue for me, I've got a well fitted TPU case, but others with Otterboxes and Lifeproof cases will have reason to complain.Otherwise, it's a simple/elegant mount that just works.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BZWW3ES" id="B00BZWW3ES-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-11:</strong> This car phone mount is the best hands down.I have reviewed a few phone mounts, I was thinking this was going to be another run of the mill mount, this one if far from standard. The mount is made of plastic, but the plastic is very dense, which makes it strong but light. In the hand, it has a solid feel, nice and sturdy.The mount is great, it can be attached on the windshield or dashboard, and most others only have one choice. If you prefer to use the windshield as I did, this makes you phone similar to a GPS. Just remove the protective film from the sticky suction cup, activate the suction locking lever, and insert your phone.If you like the dashboard over the windshield, there is a supplied mounting disk with 3M adhesive foam to attach to the dashboard, which will give a flatter surface for attachment. For best installation us an alcohol wipe to clean and prep the textured dashboard surface to ensure the best grip.The fact that the mount can accept a wide range of phones is great. It even holds my Note 2 with the"OtterBox Case"on it, which even surprised me. The ball and socket joint gives the option of turning the phone "360 Degrees", now you can put it where you want it. If the suction cup is not holding as good as it once was. All you have to do is rinse it with water, let air dry, just as good as new.I know this mount is make for the driver, but I have used on the side rear window so the little one can watch a movie (it keeps them quiet).If you need a mount that works great, this is the one for you. It even has a two year warranty.I was supplied a sample for the purpose of review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BZWW3ES" id="B00BZWW3ES-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-02:</strong> This is a perfect car mount for most of your devices. The grip is really strong, so you don't have to worry about your phone/GPS falling down. The suction cup is really strong but very easy to install & remove. The 360 rotation allows you to mount your device at different angle and still move it according to your preference.Pros:+ Looks really good+ Suction cup is the best have I have ever seen+ 360 degree rotation+ Compatible with a lot of devices (Samsung S4, GPS, Iphone 5S etc.)+ Can be installed on windshield & dashboardCons:- NAI have been using this mount for a while. I never had any problem with it. My phone/GPS has never fallen out of this mount. I did not give any con to this product because I honestly didn't see any. The product is worth the price.

Of course, you can use your own phone's proprietary charging wire.+ CHARGES OFF ANY STANDARD USB CHARGER - you can use either then provided wire or your own.The bads:- The built-in charging Micro-USB wire is a little short - about one inch because you don't want to stretch it too much - and it's not easy to pull out. This charger is meant to be used by responsible adults.- Too shiny - both the front and back come in a super-shiny finish, making it a fingerprint collector.- The manual's English is atrocious - this is a Made in China product. The product's quality is excellent but the maker should hire a native English-speaker/writer to fix the manual.Overall, I am quite pleased with the product. The functionality is there, the in-body charging wire is an innovation that makes the product stand out, the small/light body is 'right' and the few 'bads' that I noted may or may not matter to any particular user.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CCWP93W" id="B00CCWP93W-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-07:</strong> Ultra Slim 3200mAh External Battery Pack looks very slick, it is quite thin. One unique feature of this external power pack is that it has a micro USB cable built into the side of the unit (see attached photo collage). It pops out of the side on a coiled cable, so if your mobile device takes a micro USB connector you don't need to carry any extra cables. This built-in cable delivers very rapid charging (see test results below). The power pack also has a port which allows you to connect other connectors, so it works with devices that have proprietary connectors as well.I tested Ultra Slim 3200mAh External Battery Pack with Galaxy Nexus Phone (running ICS 4.0.4), Samsung Galaxy 7.7 Tablet (running ICS 4.0.4) and iPad Mini.I received this power bank from the manufacture for an honest review be it positive or negative. Top reviewers are often asked to review new battery packs and one of the benefits of being asked to test different power banks is that it gives me an opportunity to compare them to each other using the same charging test, so I can compare them using "apples to apples" comparison. This set of tests allows me to provide unbiased results as the numbers speak for the performance of each unit.I received two identical units black and white, having two of them allows me to test for consistency in manufacturing. Ideally I want to see the same performance numbers for both units, and this was the case with the two Ultra Slim power packs .My methodology is to charge each mobile device on each port of the unit for 10 minutes and measuring how much each unit was charge in that 10 minute period. In addition I tested charging two mobile devices at the same time. Each line in the table below represents a separate 10 minute test. I use Battery App by Elvison to determine how each device recognized the charging source. 'AC' status means the charging is at full charging rate. 'USB' status indicates charging at a lower charging rate. 'Discharging' status means that the charging rate is below the power that the device is consuming so it slows down the discharge rate but does not re-charge.&#10152; General features:======================Ultra Slim 3200mAh external battery weighs 3.2 oz. Its size is 2.25" x4.25 " x 0.375". The pack has one USB output port and one built-in micro USB cable.In addition to the built-in micro USB cable Ultra Slim comes with a charging cable and two tips - micro USB and iPad. It did not have tips for Samsung Galaxy Tab or lightening connector for iPad Mini and I used my own charging cables during the tests. I am attaching a photo of the Ultra Slim 3200mAh during one of the test next to my tablet for size reference. You can find this photo by following 'customer photos' link under the main photo in this listing.Ultra Slim 3200mAh looks very slick: it is thin, has a nice finish, and in general has a look and shape of a smart phone. It shows the charge level by displaying 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% on panel. When it is charging, however, this indicator gets turned off. But the charging continued even when the lights were off. This is a little different from how other external power pack indicators work (they stay on when you are charging),so I wanted to mention it. In addition to the charging capabilities, Ultra Slim has a built-in flashlight.&#10152; Test Results:======================&#10004; Galaxy Nexus Phone~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~White unit: AC ~~~~~ 6% change in charge in 10 minutes (built-in mciro USB charging cable)Black unit: AC ~~~~~ 6% change in charge in 10 minutes (built-in mciro USB charging cable)White unit: AC ~~~~~ 2% change in charge in 10 minutes (separate charging cable)Black unit: AC ~~~~~ 2% change in charge in 10 minutes (separate charging cable)&#10004; Samsung Galaxy 7.7 tablet~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~White unit: AC ~~~~~ 1% change in charge in 10 minutes (separate charging cable)Black unit: AC ~~~~~ 1% change in charge in 10 minutes (separate charging cable)&#10004; iPad Mini tablet~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~White unit: AC ~~~~~ 1% change in charge in 10 minutes (separate charging cable)Black unit: AC ~~~~~ 1% change in charge in 10 minutes (separate charging cable)&#10152; Key finding:======================&#10004; This power pack has great performance with built-in micro USB cable.&#10004; Using your own charging cables the power pack works with both Galaxy 7.7 Tablet and iPad Mini but performance is on the slow side.&#10004; I observed the same performance for both the black and white model, which is good and reflects consistency in the manufacturing process.I highly recommend this power pack to people who can take advantage of the built-in micro USB cable.Note: the photo collage referenced in the review can be located by following 'customer photos' link under the main photo.Ali Julia review</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CCWP93W" id="B00CCWP93W-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-10:</strong> The iFlash Ultra Slim Portable Power Bank Ultra has a great look and design that can add 1 full charge or add 10 hours of talk time to your iPhone 4S / 4G / 3GS, 100+ hours audio playback, or 100% - 200% to the battery life of most mobile phones.

I also have (and have reviewed) the white version. Rather than repeat the review, I'll summarize the main points: this is a nicely made, very slim (about 3/8 inch thick) powerbank that works well. What it lacks in terms of charge capacity it makes up for in ease of carrying around.Like the white version, the only major issue I have with this is the micro USB cable that is built into the device. While this is a good idea since it makes the power bank easier to use, the cord length is too short for comfortable use (about 4 inches long fully extended) and it can be a pain to recoil the cord so that it fully retracts into the power bank body. That's the main reason for a loss of one star.However, the black version also has another strike: it is a major fingerprint magnet. While I'm sure the white version attracts as many fingerprints since it also has a glossy finish, you have the benefit of not seeing them. That's not the case with the black version - smudges galore!I won't detract a star because of that since it's strictly an aesthetic issue and has nothing to do with performance, but point it out in case you're bugged by easily smudged devices.Like the white version this does most things very well, and does so with a very small footprint that's easy to take along. Definitely worth considering, and a good value for the price.[sample provided for review]</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CCWP93W" id="B00CCWP93W-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-02:</strong> This external battery is so slender and so sleek that it looks like a small iPhone. I can stick the battery in my purse with its charging cable to have it available wherever I go. Most other external batteries are more bulky; therefore, I take them with me only when I'm traveling. This iFlash power bank simply slips in one of the inner phone pockets in my handbag. Even better, I like that I can get more than one iPhone 5 charge out of it even though the specs say only one full charge.It takes about two hours for the battery to charge my iPhone 5 (lightning cable/adapter not included), about 30 minutes longer than if I plugged it into an outlet -- not bad at all. I like the push button display of how much charge is remaining (in 25% increments.) There's also a pull-out micro USB cable built into the side for charging devices with that kind of connection; for this reason, the battery is ideal for smartphones that use micro-USB. It comes in two colors, this black one and a white version.

For one thing it is quite slim, compact, and easy to tuck away in a desk drawer, purse, or briefcase.  I like the power banks that are usually dubbed "lipsticks," but this one is much less clunkier than any of those are.  The most interesting, and perhaps welcome thing about the iFlash, is the fact that it has an internal spring output plug.  At first I thought it was a switch, but was very pleased to note otherwise.  It comes out quite easily when you simply pinch and pull.I instantaneously knew how much power was in the battery when I pressed the button on the top face where the iFlash logo is.  Instead of simple dots or slashes accompanied by numbers, the LED lights are underneath.  The numerical panel lights up nicely with a bright blue.  If you hold the button for a couple of seconds, the mini LED flashlight comes on (reverse the process to turn it off).  I gave this small battery pack a little workout right out of the box.  I tried it out with an iPad, which it certainly isn't meant for, but was getting a surprising  2% to 3% charge every fifteen minutes.  Mind you, this little experiment was undertaken with a battery pack with probably no more than a 74% charge to begin with.This is definitely a high-quality battery pack that is set up for gift giving.  It's in a hard shell, plastic case rather than a box and is very attractive.  The box can either be recycled, use to store the battery pack or used for something else.  I'd never heard of iFlash before testing some of their battery packs, but have definitely been pleased with not only the performance, but also attention to detail.  For example, the cords are of high quality and the plugs fit quite snuggly.  iFlash stands behind their product and is offering a 1-year limited warranty.WHAT'S IN THE BOX:~  3200mAh power bank~  USB cable~  30-pin connector~  5-pin micro USB connectorSPECS:~ Weight: 92g (.20 pound)~ Capacity:  3200mAh~ Input: DCV/1A~ Output: DC5V/0.6A~ Output charging time:  2 - 3 hours~ Input charging time: 4 - 5  hours~ Recycling time: Unknown (probably around 500 times)~ One year limited warranty~  ROHS and CE certifiedDIMENSIONS:~  107(L)x57(W)x10(T) mm 4.17 x 2.24 x 0.4 inchesPOWER INDICATORS:(These are numerical from 25 to 100)~ Not lit up:  &lt;25%~ One LED light on: 25% - 49% (25)~ Two LED lights on: 50% - 74% (50)~ Three LED lights on: 75% - 99% (75)~  Four LED lights on: 100% (100)OPERATING PARAMETERS:~  Working Temperature:  -20 - 45 C (-4 - 113 F)~  Storage Temperature:  -20 - 60 C (-4 - 140 F)~  Working Humidity:  20% - 80%~  Storage Humidity:  20% - 90%Sample provided for review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CCWP93W" id="B00CCWP93W-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-10:</strong> This is my review of the iFlash Ultra Slim 3200 mAh power bank. It came with a micro USB adapter and an apple adapter for Apple devices before the lightning connector. Now power banks are usually pretty big and bulky to compensate for the battery charge that they are holding, this one is unique. This power bank offers a 3200 mAh back up which is enough to charge phones with small batteries (not smart phones) quite a couple of times and a smart phone maybe about 1 time and then another half charge. This power bank conserves battery life unlike other external batteries though, the battery indicator on most power banks light up when charging a device and that lets you know how much percentage of a charge the power bank still has, this is great but those lights that are always on can reduce the overall performance by using up some of the stored energy.When you connect a device to this power bank it immediately commences to charge, but the lights remain off! This helps improve the battery life of the iFlash power bank, a neat feature that makes this one such a good power bank. This power bank also incorporates a built in micro USB cable on the right side of the product, it is a couple inches long so it isn't that long, but just having the option of using it makes it that much better if your device charges via a micro USB cable. This addition makes it not only more usable, but more portable because you don't need to carry around the cable for that such device.The best feature of the iFlash 3200 mAh powerbank, at least to me, would have to be its design, it is an amazing design and it looks amazing. It is ultra slim, it is about a third of the thickness of my phone and unlike other power banks this one is so slim and small that you can even fit it in a pocket if you really wanted to.The only con to this powerbank is that its output is at 0.6 Amps, not necessarily a bad thing it just means that the rate of charge isn't going to be as fast as if you connected it to a charger with a 1 Amp output or 2.1 Amps. I would say that although this power bank is capable of charging tablets and pretty much any device that charges via a USB port it would be more suitable for phones in general that don't have big batteries such as the Samsung Galaxy devices since those would be better off charging at a faster rate.Overall I can highly recommend this product, you will be sure to enjoy it and you won't regret purchasing one.I rate this product a perfect 5 stars out of 5 stars!I was provided this product for testing and evaluation and my review of this product is completely honest and unbiased, the words stated above are my own.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CCWP93W" id="B00CCWP93W-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-15:</strong> I've seen external battery chargers for mobile devices that had capacities as high as 12,000mAh, with up to three charging ports. For many cellphone and tablet users, that's overkill, and those chargers are fairly heavy and bulky, as well as expensive. At 4.17"x2.24"x0.4" (slightly smaller than an iPhone 4) and weighing barely three ounces, the iFlash Ultra Slim 3200 is small enough to carry in a pocket, and the smoothly curved edges won't poke a hole in your pocket. The micro-USB and iOS/Apple plugs included in the package will work with almost every mobile device sold in this country. One of each of the two plugs is included, but perhaps the best feature is a built-in micro-USB plug with a coiled cable (about 4" long) that you can never misplace. Note that no AC wall charger is included in the kit.I tested the charger with my two mobile devices, a Samsung Android cellphone (1800mAh battery) and an Amazon Kindle Fire HD 7" (4400mAh battery). Even allowing for electrical losses, the iFlash Ultra Slim 3200 should fully recharge any smartphone at least once, and extend the runtime of tablets by a few hours. Note that the output of the iFlash unit is 0.6 Amps, so charging will likely be slower compared to larger-capacity backup batteries.For users who don't require a heavy duty charger, the iFlash Ultra Slim 3200 backup battery looks like a very good choice.A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CCWP93W" id="B00CCWP93W-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-10:</strong> TheiFlash Ultra Slim 3200mAh Power Bankis thin, small and can fit in the palm of your hand.  This portable power bank is perfect for use with Smart Phones, including Apple and Android Devices.  Ideal for devices using Micro-B, a coil cable is built into the power bank and pops out whenever you need it.Other included accessories in the package:+ One (1) 6" white USB cable for use with the included tips+ One (1) Micro-B tip, and One (1) 30-pin Apple tip+ One (1) black soft carrying pouch.  This pouch has a divider inside to help keep your power bank and cables separate.Even if your device does not use Micro-B or Apple 30-pin, you can still use your own charging USB cable with the iFlash via the USB output port.  This unit also features a LED mini flashlight that is activated by pressing and holding the power button, it is turned off by pressing and holding again.  The unit features percentage indicators illuminated by small blue LED lights which fade after a few moments, conserving power. This is great for knowing the current available supply in the power bank.At 3200mAh, this is designed with Smart Phones in mind, and can fully charge most smart phones, with additional power left for another partial, if not full, charge.  This power bank can also add hours of life to most tablets, but is not designed for that use, due to the lower capacity.Overall, theiFlash Ultra Slim 3200mAh Power Bankis the take-anywhere spare battery you have always needed.  Available inblackorwhite, the iFlash Ultra Slim is a fine value for such a portable multi-feature power bank.Disclosure: I received a sample product from the manufacturer for the purposes of providing this review.

You charge the power bank and take it with you to charge your mobile devices when their battery power runs low. This is especially handy for the times you're on the go & don't have access to a power source to charge your mobile device.The iFlash 3200mAh power bank won't provide a wealth of power for your devices, but what it lacks in power it makes up for in portability. Its slim, lightweight design also includes a built-in micro spring charging cable and a built-in LED flashlight! If your device requires a micro USB connection to charge, you won't need to carry anything extra with you, only this slim, light power bank - no extra cables or connector tips, just put this power bank in your bag & go! However, because the Output port is .6A, it will take longer to charge your device than power banks that feature a 1A or larger output port.It arrived with an almost full charge so it was ready to use right out of the box. You don't have to turn on the power bank to begin charging your device; just plug it in & the charging begins. The 3200mAh power bank charged my iPod Touch 4G, Kindle Fire HD & my LG Cosmos prepaid phone. I used the included USB cable & Apple 30 pin tip to charge my iPod. I used the built-in, internal micro spring charging cable to charge my phone & Kindle Fire HD. It seems that only one device can be charged at a time.Press & hold the power button to turn the flashlight on/off.To charge the power bank, plug the included charging cable & micro USB connector tip into a USB AC adapter or into your PC.What's in the box:1 Micro USB white Connector/tip1 Apple 30 Pin white Connector/tip1 27.5" white USB cable1 3200mAh power bank with built-in micro USB internal spring charging cable1 instruction manualApproximate measurements:Measures: 4 1/4" x 2 1/4" x 3/8"Weight: 3.2 ozGreat product!

The exterior is pristine white with silver trimmings on the side.  It is perfect for those who wants to have extra juice but doesn't want to travel with heavy clunky power banks.  It is less than a centimeter in thickness and just 92 gms.The remaining charge can be seen clearly on the front in blue LED - 25, 50, 75 and 100 which corresponds to how much juice is left in percentage.  The power button is at the front and unlike some other chargers is a lot easier to find.  If your phone charges via microUSB, you don't even have to carry a charging cable with you; the iFlash has a very convenient retractable.  An added bonus is an LED flashlight.  You can turn it on by pressing and holding the power button for about 1.5 seconds; it turns off the same way.The iFlash 3200 can be a great gift.  It is a beautiful product and packaged nicely in hard clear shell.  It comes with a USB cable and an extra 30-pin tip for older IOS devices.Sample item provided by the distributor for evaluation review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00CCWP93W', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00CCWP93W', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00CUU6K5M</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00CUU6K5M</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CUU6K5M" id="B00CUU6K5M-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-14:</strong> SORRY I ALREADY REPAIR MY OLD PHONE, A GALAXY NOT 1.

The picture is good but the signal flashes on and off at least 10 times per minute. I'm not going to pay $10 to send it back to China so I'm just out of luck. Its too bad these cables can't be tested before shipped across the world to the buyer.

No matter what kind of dexterity and alertness you may have been blessed with, you are still challenging fate every time you decide to talk on the phone and drive.  A tree or a telephone pole is just begging for your acquaintance the whole time.  I picked up one of these Jupiter Jacks (stupid name) at a local discount store here.  I drive a car with a stick shift that makes it extra hard to hold onto a phone and shift at the same time.  For starters let me say that the Jupiter Jack, (JJ) is a very well thought out unit in its design.  It mounts easily just about anywhere, while at the same time it is not so big and intrusive that it either gets in the way, or should spoil the looks for those of us more fashionably minded about our cars. It also has a good universal design for holding just about any kind of cell phone, and it comes with a variety of jacks for fitting your particular phone.  The set up with your radio should take about 5 minutes once you have installed in on your dash.Unfortunately when it comes to JJs actually doing what it is supposed to do, the show is pretty much over after the above opening number.  Despite the commercial on TV offering the impression that it pretty much transmits through your car radio as easily as a local station, it doesn't come through any where near that clearly in real use.  The signal does pretty much what cell phone signals do when you are driving around talking.  They fade in and out and draw static here and there.  Only with the JJ, it happens that much more often.  When I installed mine I took a drive for about 30 minutes and called several people.  None of the calls were what I would label a success, or came off as much of an improvement on JJs claims.  Two of the calls withered and died, and I had to call them back the old fashioned way.  Even when the JJ completed a call, the sound quality coming from the speakers was not any where near the fidelity of your regular stations.  Not really full of static, but somewhat cheap and hard to decipher.  I really didn't make any distinction between the quality of calls being disrupted by stronger signals close by, or just JJ being a piece of junk.  Contrary to what the commercial I have seen says, my unit had two different frequencies that you could choose from.  That may help those that are being interrupted by stations horning in on your signal, but it will not improve the technology of the JJ which is unfortunately not that good.In conclusion, the JJ is a very good idea that has your safety and convenience in mind.  Whether you decide to take a chance on this unit or not, you shouldn't be driving and talking at the same time.  But as far as recommending the JJ, it's my opinion that in most cases you will be sorely disappointed.  You will most likely find its habit of working and then not, dropping out, and even when it is as its best being a disappointment anyway, too much of a pain and end up going back to your bluetooth, or other ear phone system.  I believe that after using this, any required wires hanging around your front seat won't seem all that bad.  My take is pass this up...</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B002MSJOMI" id="B002MSJOMI-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-05:</strong> I bought this 4 work and it works really good I bought 2 of these so if 1 go bad I have a nother for backup it works really great</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B002MSJOMI" id="B002MSJOMI-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-12-27:</strong> The think they don't tell you is that you could also use the Jupiter Jack with your MP3 player. I use one for my phone in my car all the time because the state I live in requires you to use a hands free device when driving. The one big thing I want to stress is DO NOT TALK ABOUT ANYTHING PERSONAL (like your personal financial stuff) because if others are around you and scanning for radio stations they could pick up on your conversation.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B002MSJOMI" id="B002MSJOMI-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-08:</strong> I didn't like this.

Cutting my phone bill in half while staying on the AT&T; network is the biggest plus.My place is a cellular dead zone so I had to use AT&T;'s Microcell for coverage which you can't use with Straight Talk.  I was worried about the service I would get at home without the Microcell.  But, oddly enough I get more bars with Straight Talk than I did via AT&T; without the Microcell.Switching over was not without problems.  I am currently using an HTC One X until I get a new phone this spring and when I initially activated my Straight Talk sim card I was able to port my number, make calls and send/received texts within a few minutes.  However, I could not access data without being on wifi.  I did contact Straight Talk's Customer Service and they were able to fix the issue with one phone call.The only bad thing with this plan is the data cap (2.5 GB month) so streaming Netflix or Pandora (for long periods) is probably a no-no which is why I am going to get a newer phone with external storage capability mainly store music.  Still even with off-contract phone prices, I will save in the long run versus remaining on my AT&T; plan.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BD4BLM8" id="B00BD4BLM8-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-04:</strong> att no longer allows to call forward *004* on straight talk any more ... you get what you pay for but straight talk is pretty awesome at a fraction of the cost.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BD4BLM8" id="B00BD4BLM8-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-02:</strong> Perfect and just as described.

Well, that's not entirely true. I actually VERY HIGHLY recommend you head over to Straight Talk's website to order this. It's cheaper and comes with free shipping. At least as of right now it is less than this. And you can purchase your access (unlimited talk, text, data) at the same time, along with enrolling in auto-top up if you know you want to use the service.As for the Micro SIM, it works as expected. You may need an unlocked phone for this to work, I don't know for sure as my phone is already unlocked.Simply pop the SIM off the card, pop it into your phone (with the power off), power up the phone and it should be recognized. Head over to the Straight Talk website to activate the number and you're done. You can't activate the SIM without either a credit card to purchase the first month of service OR with a prepaid code from WalMart.Overall the service has been good. It uses ATT's network for my phone and ATT is pretty well available where I am.Straight Talk is the cheapest way to go for unlimited talk, text and data (data is capped at 2.5 GB at 4G speed, after that you're stuck in 2G speeds, and there doesn't seem to be any way to add more data).Highly recommended if you have an off contract or unlocked phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00BD4BLM8', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00BD4BLM8', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B005OA04XO</h2>    <p class="price"> $B005OA04XO</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005OA04XO" id="B005OA04XO-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-19:</strong> BOUGHT THESE TO LISTEN TO WHILE I'M RIDING MY DUCATI SINCE YOU CANT WEAR OVER THE EAR HEADPHONES IN YOUR HELMET AND ALSO FOR THE PRICE THE SOUND QUALITY IS EXCELLENT AND I ALSO LIKE TALKING ON THE PHONE BETTER WITH THESE THAN MY OVER THE EAR HEADPHONES</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005OA04XO" id="B005OA04XO-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-16:</strong> But not the bast.

A lot of the time, that's also when everyone in the doggone world decides that they have to talk to me. So, a set of headphones with a mic on them became a convenience that I wanted. The mic sits on one of the small headphone wires, and sits close enough to your mouth that you don't have to mess with it. The unit, as a whole, seems kind of flimsy, but we shall see. I'm usually fairly easy on equipment, so it shouldn't be an issue. Of course, if you have a habit of getting wires caught on stuff, I'd say spend a little more $$ and get a set of bluetooth headphones.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005OA04XO" id="B005OA04XO-review26" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-08:</strong> these are awesome and work great! i bought these for my hubbys phone and they work and sound great.

I even stupidly bought a pair that I thought were the right kind, but they weren't.On a gamble, since this pair didn't have any Amazon reviews, I bought this pair hoping it would at least be close to the kind that originally came with the Galaxy Nexus.

Knock-offs are very hard to differentiate from the originals as they are very very well made to look alike but here are the differences I noticed:1. Main wire from the connector to the split, is thicker on the original headphones vs. the knockoffs (2.56 mm vs 2.12 mm)2. Microphone pinhole diameter (the little hole on the other side of the on/off button) is around 1 mm on the originals and 2 mm on the knock-offs3. Microphone piece is always on the right channel on the originals and on the left channel on the knock-offs 9at least on the knock-offs I got)If you happen to get the originals, they have top notch sound: bass is really impressive, mids and highs are really good, overall sound is very well balanced, so much so, that playing with the equalizer on my Nexus 4 did not improve the sound at all, if anything, it made it worse. Microphone is excellent, provided you manage to keep the pinhole up not on your clothes and that takes some getting used to.Now, if you get the knock-off headset, then you'll hate it right away. There is no bass whatsoever, mids are pretty muted and highs are pretty much the only thing you hear. without lows and mids, the volume seems to be 50% lower than the original product. The microphone is terrible as well: everybody I talked to complained that I sound muffled, they could barely understand me.I've always been "lucky" and got the original Samsung headset when I purchased from sellers that show "Fulfilled by Amazon". Buying directly from various sellers was a hit and miss: I sometimes got the original headset, other times I got knock-offs.UPDATE 11/22: I just got 2 more from eSoundSales fulfilled by Amazon. SKU ESS44SSSBE(GH59-10443B) Quality is subpar and there are no small and big silicon buds included. Nowhere close in sound quality with the ones I purchased from grab_a_deal SKU ESS44SSSBE(GH59-10419E) also fulfilled by Amazon.I have no clue how to get the real ones anymore, it seems to be hit and miss. Makes you wonder why are there so many knock-offs around and nobody does anything to stop this influx of fake products in the US.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B005OA04XO', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B005OA04XO', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B0036255ZE</h2>    <p class="price"> $B0036255ZE</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0036255ZE" id="B0036255ZE-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-08-24:</strong> Wow! I must say in a word Zagg SmartBuds are awesome! I have the Bose version. Both in the ear and over the head. Not real wild about either, but they work. Then I found something that I though nobody would beat. The Plantronics Back Beat 906. A blue tooth variation that controls your music, has excellent volume range, allows you to take calls and even pause everything and open the mic so you can hear your suroundings. I thought they were tops. Then I ordered the Zagg Sparq2.0 back up battery system. They offered a pair of SmartBuds free with the order. Ok, I always keep my Bose wired headset close or in my computer bag incase I just get tired of wearing the back beats and need something different. So the package arrived and out came the smart buds. I plugged them in and....WOW! These things crank louder than ANY headset I have tried since I started using ipods and iphones, many, many years ago. I also have ALWAYS had my EQ setting on bass boost. Not needed with the Zagg SmartBuds. I loved my blue tooth ear phones because I could never get an "in ear" version to stay in my ears. Not a problem with the Zagg cord management system. These are by far the most comfortable ear phones I've ever used, Back Beats included. The only thing I would change if I could change anything would be the slider volume control. It's just a little touchy with such a broad range in a small slide area. It's easy to blast yourself when trying a small adjustment. Call quality is awesome. I'm loud and clear and so are my callers to me. I am very impressed and will order another pair to keep in my other bag..

The reasons why I only give it two stars are because 1. slots for the charger 2. power button 3. tailIt's almost great that the tail is detachable because you could decide when you want it.  But then it just leaves this empty circle on the back of my phone vulnerable.  And the tail is too detachable.  It comes off way too easy.The power button is held firmly so that got my button stuck.What really bothered me and pissed me off the most is that the bottom slot isn't big enough to allow me to charge my phone.  I have to remove my phone from the cover to charge it and while doing so, it stretches out the cover and puts risk of popping the tail off.  Only sometimes could i get the tail to stay for long.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005GNENB8" id="B005GNENB8-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-11:</strong> I thought it would be cute to have it but the fluffy tail doesn't stay on but without the tail it looks weird.

The original charger had a detachable USB cord.  A replacement two piece charger was also available on Amazon for a couple extra dollars.  I never used the USB connection, so I am fine with this current setup.  The charger travels well.However, the charger I did receive did not match the picture either.  The charger I received had a wall plug with a circular, red power light (resembling the power button on an Xbox 360).  The only existing picture when I ordered was a larger wall charger with a green light at the bottom.  I am not complaining about the look of the charger I was given; however, I think it is an important point when other reviews discuss cord lengths, which may be different if multiple charger models are being sent out!!!  The cord length with my version was about 54 inches long (yes, I brought out the tape measure for this review-only the best for Amazon).The charger worked as promised on the Samsung Droid Charge for the first couple weeks.  After awhile, I noticed the phone would sometimes no longer charge while being plugged in (the phone was off and the battery was nearly dead at the time).  I tested the phone with other chargers (including the Samsung Droid desk stand).  The phone had no problems charging with these.  I tested the outlet with other appliances (i.e. lamps and laptop charger) and had no problems.  I have not had the charging problem since that week, but I have only used the wall charger 1 or 2 more times since then (I have switched back to the Samsung desktop charging stand).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052486M8" id="B0052486M8-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-29:</strong> Perfect for home and travel use.

By Day 3, this was the only one we carried.  It charged up our iPhone and iPad faster than the other two batteries, was smaller and more pocket friendly, lighter, and in fact, light enough for my son to be able to make use of the wrist lanyard while using his iPad while standing in some of the longer lines. We were able to charge both my iPhone and my wife's iPhone from less than 10% power to a full charge, and to prolong the life of our son's iPad too, many times over the course of a few very long days in which we were using the phones frequently with the Park's app, and to communicate with each other, take pix and so on.It charged up very quickly too, and the bright blue color made it easy to find in our hotel room, where the clutter quickly grew.I had never heard of Eagle Tech before trying this battery, but if this battery is an indicator of their typical quality, then I think we can expect to see and hear a lot more about them.  Very impressed!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00D37M31Q" id="B00D37M31Q-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-24:</strong> I have tried a number of external battery packs in the never ending quest to keep my portable electronics powered up. This one is better than most, but doesn't really live up to its advertised capabilities as a "tablet" charger.=== The Good Stuff ===* I like the case, mostly. It is smooth, has nice rounded edges so it doesn't snag on anything, and is a nice size for stashing in a shirt pocket. I didn't weigh the unit, but it is lighter than you would expect. It also has a built-in flashlight.* Unlike other external power packs I own, this one will actually charge my 2nd generation iPad if you use the high current output. All the other ones I own do not charge the iPad at all. It takes a few hours for it to recharge completely. The unit stays cool to the tough when charging or discharging.* The whole thing is pretty intuitive. The display consists of five very small blue LED's. You need to press the button to activate the LED's, and they go off after a few seconds. I hate electronics that has to flash lights for no apparent reason-tough enough to keep a hotel room dark.=== The Not-So-Good Stuff ===* The lightweight batteries come with a flip side, namely low capacity. A full charge on the Eagle-Tech translates into taking my iPad from 12% charge to 42% charge. It did charge my iPhone twice on a full charge. Charging times seemed roughly equivalent to a wall charger.* The LED "flashlight" borders on useless. Also to turn it off and on requires a double tap on the switch, and this seemed a bit fussy.* To charge this unit, you need a micro-USB cable. I am sure they did this to make it obvious which ports were input and output, but it does means you need one extra cable in your bag. The supplied cord is not long enough to allow the unit to rest on the floor when connected to a charger plugged into any typical wall outlet, so the unit sort of hangs by its charging cord. This is just asking for trouble with loose connections.* The two output ports are rated for different output currents-only one is capable of charging most tablets. That is OK, but good luck reading the markings above the ports, especially in low or dim light. The LED flashlight is no help. You can charge a tablet and a phone at the same time, although the battery was drained before my phone was able to get a full charge. I suspect it would completely charge two phones simultaneously.* The unit comes with a wrist strap, which fits into a small slot on the body of the unit. It takes a bit of talent to thread the strap through the hole- I ended up using a carpet needle to finally push it through.=== Summary ===I own a number of external power packs, and this is probably my favorite. It has a few nice features, and will likely earn a spot in my travel gadget bag. Unfortunately it is billed as a "tablet" charger, a task for which it just doesn't have the batter capacity it should.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00D37M31Q" id="B00D37M31Q-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-30:</strong> The Neptor battery pack has a nice feel. It's a great ergonomic shape for any pocket. And, it has a flashlight ! What more could you ask for?I'm not a huge power user on my phone ( I don't talk all day or watch Netflix). I do use the GPS about 1.5 hours every morning plus moderate usage throughout the day. I have to charge my Sprint Nexus with (so-called) extended battery every night.So I did the following experiment:Sunday AM: Started with a fully charged phone. I only used the Neptor to charge my phone starting Sunday night. It charged fully Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday nights. On Wednesday night the Neptor was totally pooped out. Decent performance, for it's size, really.Other aspects of the design are pretty slick. It seems to shut itself off after fully charging the phone. The LED gives you some idea of it's charge when you press the on button. Also, did I mention it's a flashlight?My other experience with this type of charger is theEnergizer Universal Multi-Port Smartphone Rechargeable Charger with 2 USB Ports, Micro USB Cable, 10W and 5W Charger. It's more expensive, and I was not too impressed with it. Also, it was bulkier.If you really need one of these fairly often, then I guess it's worth the steep price tag. If you don't travel a lot, or just need to make it through the occasional emergency call when your battery is dead, consider something like theBurro Mobile Charger - AA-Powered, USB Power Pack - Building Better Lives in Africa. Not as slick as this product, but a lot cheaper and uses AA batteries.Edit: It's been about a year.I just spent a long time traveling, and this was a real benefit to have. Phones keep getting more power hungry, and it's nice to have that back-up.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00D37M31Q" id="B00D37M31Q-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-21:</strong> This battery charger has solved a major problem for me.  Instead of having only one port to charge my iPad and smartphone, it has two!  Now I don't have to choose which of my electronics I want to charge as I can do both at the same time.Smaller than my smartphone, it has a 2.1A and a 1.0A port.  The first will charge a tablet and the second a smartphone.  While the second will also charge a tablet, it takes longer and may not fully charge.  It also has a lanyard.  It took me a bit of fussing to get it through the hook where it attaches but after working with it for a few minutes, I got it done.There is a flashlight component with this battery charger which means I can take the small flashlight out of my purse.  I love it when things are multi-purpose.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00D37M31Q" id="B00D37M31Q-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-17:</strong> Summary: This unit has a very nice design and works well, now available at a better price. [updated 7/2/2014]The ET-NP056K is definitely made of high quality materials, even the USB cable is a step above, being an attractive, matching color, flat style cable, so you will always know it's the right one.  The case is covered with a very nice rubberized material which looks elegant and provides a good grip, so this won't slip out of your fingers and drop (some of the competition could learn from this).  The indicator lights are nice and provide a good estimate of remaining battery power, and the controls are very simple, making this device quite easy to use.5600mAh is a very good power rating for this size device and should handle all phones with ease and is even enough for most tablets.  There are two USB charging ports, 1 and 2.1 amps, the 1 amp port is for phones and other low powered devices, and the 2.1 amp for tablets and other devices which need more power.  Both ports can be used at the same time with some extension in charging time.The device is simple to use, just plug in your device and wait.  The "on/off" switch is really used just to check remaining battery capacity and to activate the low powered single LED "flashlight" function. Press once and the 4 LEDs light up to show battery capacity remaining, each LED is 25%, so 4 LED's = fully charged and 1 = 25% or less capacity remaining. After a brief time the LEDs turn off automatically.  Press the button twice and the low power single LED light comes on.  Press twice again to turn it off. Think key ring style light output, not really flashlight level by any stretch, still a nice bonus feature.  A lanyard/wrist strap is included and is also of matching color and high quality.  This is without a doubt the best looking device of its type I have seen.  Also very sleek and small, would easily fit into a pocket, purse, bag, or whatever and is very light weight.Oddly, nowhere in the instruction manual does it tell you how to charge the device itself.  While it's very obvious, I guess, you use the provided cable and plug into the USB port of your PC/laptop or a USB A/C adapter, still it's a puzzling omission. No other USB cables or connectors are provided, assumption is your device came with those, I guess.Quibbles: No A/C adapter is included, at this price that seems a bit strange.  The manual is terse and barely adequate, but is sufficient.  Comparable devices sell for less that half the price of this unit, though they are a bit shy of this device in terms of ease of use, attention to detail, and quality of materials.  Still, you are paying quite a premium here for style.  That said, it is one of the best devices of this type I have seen and if quality materials, function, and style are important to you, this may be your best choice.Final rating: 4 stars primarily for lack of USB A/C adapter and relative value.  (5 stars for design and function.)(Postscript: Believe it or not, it is possible to attach the wrist strap, even though the hole provided is so very small it is quite difficult.  I was able to use a small screwdriver (the kind used for eye glasses) to push it through the microscopic hole.  Not sure why they made it so small, a minor flaw in an otherwise very well designed case, but it works.)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00D37M31Q" id="B00D37M31Q-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-31:</strong> I have several power banks of varying sizes, and I have to say, for the size, this one does very well.  While I won't rely on it for a long trip (I have aUSB External Battery Pack 18000mAh (White Limeade Blast L180X) USB Charger with built-in Flashlight for Smartphones and other electronic devicesthat has 18,000 mAh that will charge my phone, my Galaxy tab, and my Kindle PW and then charge my phone again, but it's a little heavy to throw in my purse.  The Eagle Tech power bank is light, holds enough to charge mySamsung Galaxy S III/S3 GT-I9300 Factory Unlocked Phone - International Version (Pebble Blue)up to 100% (from 25%) and then charge it a smidgen more, which is really all I might need for the day.  (**disclaimer - I don't watch movies on my phone or stream a lot of music, so I usually only need to charge my phone overnight.)I haven't tried this on mySamsung Galaxy Tab 2 (7-Inch, Wi-Fi), but I really don't need it to work on that.  This says it will charge it, and other reviewers say it works (which is awesome - not every power bank will charge a Galaxy tab!) but it's only enough juice to take the edge off.  For plane trips or long car rides, I'm throwing the Limeade Blast into my bag.I did have my phone plugged into the 2.1A output while I played Temple Run (kind of awkward - the cord's only about a foot long) and it charged my phone faster than I used up the juice.  I didn't try that on the 1A output.  The flashlight is fairly bright (click twice to turn it on or off) but it's not necessary.  It's a neat option though.Oh, I got the Blue Eagle Tech, and I love the color!  I also like the rubber coating.  At least it won't scratch anything in my purse.  The strap is kind of useless.  I gave up trying to get it into the hole after about 5 minutes - besides, why would I want to carry it around on my wrist anyway?As of this minute, this is going for $49.99, which I think is a little high for the mAh's, but 1) it's a good product and 2) I know the price will go down.  Eventually.  And 3) the USB cord color matches the rubber.  And 4) it won't scratch anything in my purse or work bag.  And 5) I'm a sucker for blue.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00D37M31Q" id="B00D37M31Q-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-09:</strong> This is a very good portable battery - it works well to charge the iPhone and for the amount of power it stores it is relatively small.

This is a nice battery to have on hand. I really like how it has a special higher powered USB port for devices like the iPad so they charge quicker.The battery itself has a nice rubberized coating. I charged an iPad with it and it drained almost all of the battery, so it doesn't have enough power to get a second charge out of it. However, it still had enough power to run the flashlight. Yes, it has a flashlight, which is a great feature for power outages. It isn't a powerful light, but good in a pinch.If you are buying this for the wrist cable, forget about it. It is awful. The hole is too small. It took me ten minutes to get the strap through the hole and it was ruined by that point. Once I finally got it through the cable itself came undone from the plastic clasp that holds it together.For the price it would have been nice to have included a charger with the battery. Yes, it can be charged with any charger or computer with a USB cable, but an included charger would have been nice.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00D37M31Q" id="B00D37M31Q-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-21:</strong> This is a great little charger.

It's about the same size as thePowerGen 5200mAh Battery, and like the PowerGen battery, includes a built-in flashlight. Like the PowerGen, if you press the power button, it displays 1-4 lights to show current charge level.Mostly what's notable is that it has a 2.1 amp output port, which in my testing kept up with my iPad 4's power usage. That's important if you've completely drained your tablet. An older 1 amp output battery will not, so you can't just plug an external battery into a drained tablet and use it, you must wait for it to charge for a while. On the other hand, this battery is only about half the capacity of the iPad 4's internal battery; most people who find they want additional power for a tablet will want a much larger battery, something the 10 mAh (37 watt-hour) range.These smaller batteries are far more functional with phones and iPods. Battery life is usually much more of an issue with my iPod, and a battery this size can charge an iPod or phone multiple times. I deliberately drained my iPod 4G until it shut down and recharged it with this battery until full, which I was able to do 5 times before it would no longer charge. Oddly, the battery still showed some charge after doing this, and could power the flashlight, but automatically shut off rather quickly when I tried to charge the iPod a 6th time. Thus the real usable capacity was more like 4700 mAh. Still, 5 charges is plenty, translating to 15 hours of gaming, 25 hours of reading, or 150 hours of music.One minor feature is that the rubberized case has a tiny loop for an included wrist lanyard. It's so small that I found it quite a chore to tease the lanyard through the loop, it really requires a pin to poke the cord through. Once attached, it's functional, but in all honesty I've never had any desire for a lanyard. It makes more sense to carry a battery like this in a pocket than strapped to a wrist.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00D37M31Q" id="B00D37M31Q-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-25:</strong> Call me shallow, but in the world of plain black, white, and silver electric gadgets I can't help but be drawn to this turquoise blue battery pack. It's just darn cute. It's small, has a nice feel, the bright color means it's not immediately lost in the sea of junk in my bag and it's easy to see it and find it when my daughter takes it up to her room to charge her "borrowed" gadgets as well. I love that it has two ports, with 2 kids and 2 adults in the family who all love our gadgets we're always needing to plug something in to recharge, this little guy can handle my Kindle Fire and phone together without any issues. The cord it comes with is short, but that isn't an issue... if it is, just use a different one.... we have a drawer full and you probably do too. The flashlight seems a bit hokey and silly to add, my 9yr old likes to play with it but it seems sort of useless otherwise, I'm far more likely to use an iPhone light app then remember this has a built in flashlight, doesn't take away from it but doesn't add anything either IMO I sort of wish it came with a little matching case to store it and the cord in, mine have become separated a few times which can be annoying, again, not a deal breaker though.

The unit I received was mostly charged so I only had to plug it in for an hour or so.  One BIG plus about this unit is even if you left it sitting for a year it would still have 80% of the juice remaining.

If you're looking for a battery that'll power your devices for a short business trip or a long domestic flight, 5600mAh is the perfect size battery and Eagle Tech's quality is exceptional, making this product a great choice.  I've carried 10000mAh and 15000mAh external battery packs on single day domestic flights, but those are larger than needed.  To save space, consider a smaller battery like this model.Everything you need to know about this Eagle Tech's 5600mAh battery:- 5600mAh is a suitable battery size for recharging smart phones and iPods/iTouch devices.  If you're planning to charge tablets, go for a larger battery with 10000-15000mAh power.- The battery charges an iPhone 5 at a rate of 1% per minute.- The battery will provide enough power to charge an iPad once or an iPhone5 3-4 times.- The battery is covered in a rubberized material; it's easy to handle and grips well.- The battery includes a very nice 8-inch micro-USB cable; the cable is thin and light for packing into a small laptop bag or purse.- The battery includes two USB ports; 1.0A and 2.1A.- The battery takes about an hour to fully recharge itself using a 2.1a USB powered port.Tips for using:- Use the higher 2.1 amperage port (right side) to charge a tablet device.  Use the 1mAh (left) port for charging smaller devices and phones.- If you use a portable mobile hotspot device like Verizon's JetPack, the included 8-inch cable doubles as a recharging cable (one less cable to carry).- If you travel a lot, try storing all of your device cables, plugs, and this battery into aDrive Logic&trade; DL-64 Portable EVA Hard Drive Carrying Case Pouch (Black); this pouch keeps everything organized and makes finding cables simple when you need to recharge.I highly recommend this battery for phones and iTouch devices.  And if you want to charge tablets or plan to fly internationally (without power outlets), go with a larger mAh battery like theAnker Astro 3E 10000mAh Portable High Capacity Dual-Port External Battery Power Bank Backup Charger for iPhone 5, 4S, 4, iPad 4, 3, 2, Mini, iPods (Apple adapters not included), Samsung Galaxy S4, S3, S2, Note 2, HTC One, EVO, Thunderbolt, Incredible, ....</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00D37M31Q" id="B00D37M31Q-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-26:</strong> I've had the chance to use the Eagle Tech battery pack three times already, in just the short time I've owned it. Once was on a 5-day business trip that included 6 flight segments, and two other times for weekends away at my summer home and a stay with family members.As long as I stuck with USB cables, I had no compatibility problems. Someone else here said there was an issue with compatibility with Apple products, but it just depends on how well prepared you are with connectivity cords. Even for newer Apple portable devices with the Lightning connector, you still need full-size USB compatibility in your cord selection--and you get that with the new devices, as it's part of the wall-charging unit that's included.Anyway, I was able to use the Eagle Tech blue device (yes, very easy to find in my crowded black bag packed with lots of white and black cords and devices!).Charging was easy and thorough. On my extended trip, I just charged it overnight off my MacBook with or without USB hub and it kept its charge through repeated top-ups for my iPad mini and iPhone 5.Easy to use and highly recommended.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00D37M31Q" id="B00D37M31Q-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-12:</strong> Eagle Tech, USA ET-NP056K-BL 5600 mAh external battery packI really like this battery pack.  It's smaller than my iPhone but its a little thicker.  I have the blue color, which is pretty, and it has a nice soft feel to it.The battery pack will charge my iPhone four or five times before I have to charge it. It has four blue lights on the top that show how much power is left in the pack. You can press the button and it will show how many lights are left (total 4).  I usually charge it when it has one light left.  It also has a flashlight that turns on by pressing the button twice. It's not the brightest flashlight but it certainly is helpful. It's supposed to work for thousands of hours without recharging.It has dual ports - one for charging phones and one for tablets. I don't think it has enough power to charge my I-Pad and it drained the battery pack when I tried to charge it. That's okay because I mainly use it for my phone. I can take the battery pack with me and not have to worry about charging my phone. It's small and will fit in your pocket.It comes with a little carrying handle that is flimsy and I don't know how to attach it to the battery pack.

Since I gave up the Astro to my wife I have been on the lookout for a replacement battery pack for myself.It is reasonably intuitive to use; especially having used a similar device. Just plug in the USB cable into the Neptor and the other end into the USB port of the computer until fully charged and you're mostly ready to start using it.Unlike the Anker Astro this Neptor does not come with the adapters (ie iphone or other smart phone USB jack or a storage pouch). Those issues aside the Neptor offers a reliable backup battery for your iphone or other smart phone.

It should have never been a feature. Now with that out of the way, there are a lot of positive features. I have had several portable batteries. They work well and can charge my iPHone, but none of them could charge my iPad Mini. The Mini did not recognize the charger even. This is designed with two USB ports-one for small powered devices and one for tablets. It is marked clearly on the battery which is for each. After fully charging the battery (the 4 lights show 100% on the battery), I plugged my IPad in. It had 22% remaining power. In four hours it had 89%. This is equivalent if not better than the wall charger it comes with. I also had 25% of the battery power left. I could give my iPhone another 30% with this. I did not try to charge both at the same time, but this battery could do that. That is a great feature, and this can be used as a bridge when traveling-plug in the battery to a wall charger and attach both devices to be charged. All three are getting juice this way.The battery charges with a micro slot and USB cord-about 6-8 inches long. I can use my iPhone wall charger to juice this up or the computer.The battery has a weak flashlight on it-not really needed, but I am sure someone will find it useful.Portable batteries have saved me more than once when I have misjudged my power left.

We've been using portable battery packs for years now and I don't know how we ever lived without them.  The 1 thing I've learned over the years is that not all portable batteries are equal and 1 size will fit most, not all.You first need to decide what you need to charge, then choose a device with enough mAh you need for the device(s) you need to charge. This battery pack is 5600mAh and perfect for cell phones, music players and kindles.  It can charge tablets but does not have enough mAh to fully charge the tablet.  So to be clear, it will charge a tablet just won't get you to 100%.  The battery pack has two USB ports; 1 port is 1.0A and the other is 2.1A, which is a higher amperage needed to charge a tablet.The battery pack itself is made very well, feels nice in my hands and small enough to keep it portable. I like the blue, its very attractive, and features 2 USB charging ports so you can charge 2 devices at the same time. It also has a flashlight but not very bright but useful if you in the dark.  It comes with a micro USB to USB SHORT (Too Short) cable for charging the battery itself and a wrist strap so you can easily carry the battery pack around.  The wrist strap was a pain to install so be patient or you'll end up throwing the strap away.Charging 2 phones at one time is a wonderful feature, it stylish enough to be viewable while charging your devices, it portable enough that it can go anywhere, durable enough so when you drop it, it won't break.  It's a bummer that it does not come with a carrying case but that's not a deal breaker for us.  The 2 USB charging ports is also a awesome feature.  BUY IT, you won't be disappointed.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00D37M31Q" id="B00D37M31Q-review22" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-19:</strong> The colors are fun, it is lightweight, easy to take with you, and seems to be rather rugged.  We just took this battery pack (and a few others we own) on vacation.  This was our favorite.  It charged by iPhone5 from 15% to 93% in an hour, charged my husband's, and had enough juice left to charge our oldest son's iPhone for a bit too.  It was a lifesaver while we were out all day.  We didn't need to charge the tablets while we were out much but I did charge the ipad mini for a while and it did charge fine just not as fast as the iphones.  It's a battery pack I would buy again without question and great to have with you when you are out all day.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00D37M31Q" id="B00D37M31Q-review23" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-16:</strong> I forgot to charge my sony digicam on vacation, but luckily it's the kind that can get a charge from a USB port.

They both are able to achieve a full charge off of this battery, and it juices them up quickly. I have also used this battery for charging a Kindle Fire, Kindle Paperwhite, and a small P&S; digital camera. It is an excellent product, works efficiently and quickly, and is durable. I anticipate being able to use it for at least a few years.The case is a matte metal, which makes it scratch and dent resistent, while maintaining a slick profile. Blue LEDs indicate how much battery strength is left, and double-tapping the 'on' button will activate a white LED (super useful as a flashlight (in a pinch), or when using the battery in the dark).Zero complaints about this product. It's been a lifesaver in many situations, where I've had to rely on it for charging my cellphone, Kindle, or digital camera.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00D37M31Q" id="B00D37M31Q-review25" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-22:</strong> I was getting ready to write my review of this battery and document various facts and figures when my wife saw the battery and exclaimed "OH!  What is that?  It's cute!"  This little picture on the Amazon product page here does not do it justice, because the battery is a candy coated blue that almost perfectly matches my wife's nail polish.  And that's when I realized: I am not the target consumer for this battery, she is.  This is designed to go into a woman's purse.Mine has a matching blue wrist strap that looks just like one you might find on a woman's wristlet, and a matching blue USB... but it comes in other nail polish colors.  There are cheaper batteries (for a little more, you can getHyperion 14,000mAh External Battery Pack and Charger for HTC One X, HTC One XL, HTC One S, HTC One V, and HTC Droid Incredible 4Gwhich is an ugly black brick that works great for me), but this is a very good battery...for either gender.  But it's very cleverly packaged for a woman who wants a battery with a sense of style!  Now, if only it had a matching blue iPhone case!!!For the techies: don't try and charge two devices with this battery at the same time, and at least for my iPhone, it seemed to work just fine when I plugged into the 2.1A slot, which made my phone think it was plugged into the wall and charge faster.  Also, this is a lithium battery, so be very cautious about taking it on a plane.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00D37M31Q" id="B00D37M31Q-review26" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-23:</strong> This product has not one but TWO USB-Out ports for charging two devices at once.

While it dwarfs the smarphones that its made to charge, it's still small enough to pocket and charge the phone at the same time - granted, you need loose pockets for this. It'll easily recharge two iPhones, but charging an iPad is a no-go. It only has enough juice in it to recharge the iPad 3's massive battery about 25%.Once drained, it will recharge in a few hours with the included USB cable - you will need to provide an actual charger, however. In my case, I simply plugged it into my iPad charger, but any USB charger will do. A string of blue lights on the top will indicate its charge status (and, conversely, its discharge status when in use.)Also built into the battery is a handy LED flashlight. This is as generic a flashlight as you can get, to be used in a pinch, but it works okay if you keep that in mind. It's just a bare LED, so the light is not focused the way a true flashlight would be. Think of using the LED on your smartphone as a flashlight and you get the idea. It simply blasts an area with some light, but not a large distance.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00D37M31Q" id="B00D37M31Q-review28" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-18:</strong> The practically of a batter pack is pretty self-evident, so I'm just going to skip to performance rather than relitigate the case for such a product.I've done several test charges with an iPhone 5 and found that at best it can provide 50% charge in about 35 minutes using the 1.1A port, using about 25% of the power. I say that's pretty good.What seems to impact speed time is how well charged the battery pack is; you get the fastest charge when it's fully charged. When I tried charging my phone when the pack was at ~40%, it took 30 minutes to charge just 10%.With my iPad 2, the charge times are simply too slow-- using the 2.0A port it's been taking 1.5 hours to charge 10%, and that tends to eat up 50% of the battery packs power.Bottom line: The Eagle Tech battery pack has the potential to be a huge lifesaver when you're using your phone non-stop without any access to a power outlet. But don't plan on it giving your tablets much of a power boost.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00D37M31Q" id="B00D37M31Q-review29" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-21:</strong> Packed this little lifesaver into my road warrior bag for a 5 day trade show in Chicago and knew I would be protected during the 5 hour flight and during the random times in the conference when my phone and/or iPad were dead.  Even better, I was able to whip this thing out and hand it to other people to help them recharge their devices too.  Me=1 Power failures=0.  Huzzah.So I really like this as an alternative to those giant blocks of iphone charger+case that do neither well.  Very cool design and charges lots of things lots of times (surprised me how many times I could charge things with it without recharging).Star off for:- That tiny matching cord that charges the actual battery pack itself, which I kept randomly losing within my bag and fishing for.  The bright blue color helps.- That totally useless flashlight that just wears down the battery.  Really?  I guess it's not useful for me.  Maybe if I was in pitch black and trying to find my phone in a tent this would be helpful, but so far I've just figured out that the shiny light that is randomly coming out of my purse is this thing and had to turn it off.  Maybe they could add a lock switch to keep it off??Verdict?  Way better (in my opinion) than a bulky, one-device-only case that weighs your pretty light iPhone down.  This is easy to throw in your bag and have around - even to save your boss/friend/client's day by pulling this out and offering to recharge their device.  Don't find any use in the light but whatever - maybe you want that!

I did plug it in to a USB wall charger and it was at full capacity in about an hour.  The device also charges using a computer's USB port.The device is well designed.  It is pocket sized, with only one switch, the indicator light window and the connection ports visible.  It is sleek with a rubbery feel and it looks great.  I have the blue colored one.  Other dazzling colors are available.  There is even a wrist lanyard and a little flashlight on the thing.There is really no setup with this battery pack.  It  is completely intuitive. The operation is only a matter of using the charging cable (included) and making note of which USB output port is for iPads/tablets and which one is for iPhones or iPods.  The ports are marked 2.1A  and .5A.Yes, two devices can be charged at the same time.The Eagle Tech battery pack utilizes a Lithium battery that is purported to be rechargeable 500 times.  I can only assume that is accurate.  The battery pack is supposed to hold 80% of its capacity for up to a year.  That is good to know.The battery pack does not heat up during either charge or discharge.  I charged my iPad from half charge to 100% in about an hour plugged into the external battery pack.  There is no power-out USB cable included with the device so I had to use my own.  Not a big deal.I own two other somewhat similar external battery packs and this Eagle Tech ET-NP056K is the best of the bunch.

It is colorful and sized to be comfortable to hold or fit in a purse or bag. It has a four light indicator to tell you how much charge is still available and a small light that serves as a (weak) flashlight in case you need to locate your phone in the dark. It's easy to charge using the USB to mini cable, included, and your computer or any cell phone charger that has a USB port. Charging your apparatus (phone or iPad, etc.) is also easy using either the 1 or 2 A USB port and the cable from your phone or iPad. This is an invaluable item to bring along for travel or when you know you'll be using your phone/iPad a lot.The only reason I did not give five stars is the lack of good directions for use and the price. There are several units that are just slightly less powerful and considerably less expensive or similar in price but significantly more powerful. Eagle Tech has made a good product but they need to consider the price point of their competitors.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00D37M31Q" id="B00D37M31Q-review33" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-08:</strong> This portable "battery" for iPhone works with my iPhone 4 and 4S just fine.  It takes about 3 hours for it to fully charge an iPhone that was down to 16% battery power.  This is slower than if I could plug it in, but no worse than other battery packs I have tried.It is supposed to provide three full charges.  It gave my iPhone only one charge, no more  before I had to recharge the battery. It wouldn't do a second full charge, much less three, but that might be on account of my waiting several days before trying to recharge  my iPhone a second time.It is relatively small. I have seen smaller models, but this one is shorter than my phone. It is thicker than my iPhone though.

This one is small enough to fit nicely into my purse, but solid enough to be pretty durable. I like the bright, fun color - not only does it make a cute gadget, but it's much easier to find when I'm digging through my bag. I like the two USB ports for charging more than one device at a time. The included cord is a bit small for my taste - I would prefer something longer for when I need to charge this device. When it is fully charged, it has had enough "juice" to power up my phone to 100% more than once. I appreciate the indicator lights that let you know just how much charging life is left. And this is the second portable charger I have now that includes a flashlight on the device. I have *never* found this to be a necessary function, so I'm not sure what the point is. Altogether, though, this is a gadget that I use on a daily basis and comes in incredibly handy for charging my smart devices on-the-go.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00D37M31Q" id="B00D37M31Q-review35" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-07:</strong> I think the best way to review a product like this is to put it through a real-world/real-use test.I used this Eagle Tech external batter pack, which was 100% full, to simultaneously charge an empty iPad Mini and an empty iPhone 5. Here are the results:After 1 hour, the iPad Mini was 30% charged, the iPhone was 66% charged. The Eagle Tech battery pack showed it was still 1/2 to 3/4 full (it only has four indicator lights, not terribly accurate).After 2 hours however the iPad Mini was at 49%, the iPhone was at 90%, and the battery pack was just about out of power. I unplugged the iPhone and got a few more minutes of charge for the iPad Mini.Your mileage may vary.Other comments:The Eagle Tech battery pack has two USB charging ports, one for phones and one for tablets. This is important, as these devices charge at different amperages (1.0 and 2.1, respectively). While these are marked on the device, the markings are very small and it would have been helpful if they were printed in larger size, or even with little phone and tablet icon images on the side of the device to indicate the correct port.The battery pack also includes an LED bulb for use as a flashlight (kind of useful), and a small color-matched strap (not very useful--what are you supposed to do, carry this thing on your wrist?).Finally, this unit only comes in a selection of bright colors. They are nice, but not necessarily appropriate for business use (i.e. meetings, etc.) A black or aluminum model would be nice.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00D37M31Q" id="B00D37M31Q-review36" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-23:</strong> I dithered about the rating for this device, leaning toward 3 stars instead of 4. What pushed it to 4 is the two USB charging ports, each one labeled with the output, and one rated to charge tablets as well as smartphones. I took off a star for lack of accessories (cables, carrying pouch), and capacity level.I fully charged it after receiving it, then used it to charge my Nexus 4 phone; it took 2 hours to charge the phone from 32% to 93% using the lower-rated USB port on the charger. Then I hooked up the higher-rated USB port to my old 1st gen Kindle Fire which was at about 14%. The charger got the Kindle's battery up to 67% in 2.5 hours, then quit charging. I tried connecting it to my phone again, but it didn't charge the phone, so was obviously out of juice.The old Kindle may not be the best choice to test this external battery pack, but it's the only tablet I own right now. At least I can confirm that this battery pack will charge a tablet as well as a phone. I didn't try hooking up two of them at once. It's not the highest-capacity battery pack on the market, at 5600mAh, which is a drawback for an external battery pack that is able to charge tablets as well as smartphones.I agree with the other reviewers who found it impossible to hook up the supplied lanyard to this device, as the hole through which you're supposed to thread the lanyard is microscopic.I also own anAnker Astro 5600mAh Portable Power Bank Pack External Battery Backup Charger with Built-In Flashlightwhich I like better because it costs a lot less than this battery pack and comes with more accessories. I don't know if my Anker will also charge tablets in addition to phones, which is really this battery pack's claim to fame as far as I'm concerned. I could not care less about the "style" factor of the Eagle Tech device, and will probably continue to carry my Anker battery pack with me most of the time instead of the Eagle Tech.This thing works as represented in the product information, but I'm not blown away by it at all.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00D37M31Q" id="B00D37M31Q-review37" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-26:</strong> My review heading says it all.  This product is EXCELLENT, priced well, and extremely useful.So...its another battery pack, built well, feels great and includes a wrist strap and USB to Micro-USB cable for charging.First off---if I could change one thing, it would be the length of the USB cord...the one provided is about 8-10 inches..which is a bit small.Function:  Plug in the usb cable to a computer or other USB charger.  I used my iPhone 5 charger and charged this battery pack for a full overnight before I tried to use it.  Once charged used your standard cable to your smartphone or tablet and charge away.  Simply plug in your phone to the USB port, hit the power switch and voila..you are charging.  The device has 2 USB ports on it...one is a 1amp port for most phones and one is a 2.1amp port for tablets.NEAT FEATURE: press the power button twice and the device activates a small bright LED flash night.Usage:  I tested this with 2 phones to begin with...my power hungry iPhone 5 and my even more hungrier Samsung Galaxy S4.  It worked great on both devices.  I did also test with a iPad mini (but my testing was for a short time and thus I will not comment on it).  For my phones, which see moderate daily use, I achieved expected results.My Samsung device was down to about 30% battery one afternoon after heavy usage and I wanted to make sure it had about 50% at the bare minimum.  I plugged it into this charger, using the 1amp port and I was charging at the rate of approximately 5% every 10 minutes...or 30% per hour.  Theoretically you could plug the smartphone into the 2amp port and speed up charging, but it is risky in that you would provide too much power to your phone and thus could hurt the battery.  Personally I am satisfied with the charging rate on the 1amp port.  The iPhone 5 had similar results, if not a tad faster in charging....which could be related to use.  The iPhone seems to sip at battery power when charging where as the Samsung uses full power even while charging.One thing to watch out for:  When you put the battery pack in a bag, make sure it is free of obstacles so that the power button does not get depressed while moving around.  This happened to me once, but minor adjustments in my storage of the device in my bag resolved the issue.This is a 5 STAR item and respectfully so.  Love it and have no hesitation in recommending it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00D37M31Q" id="B00D37M31Q-review38" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-30:</strong> I've been using portable battery packs for several years now and I find them indispensable, but they are not generally one-size-fits-all. You need to choose the one with the mAh you need for the device(s) you need to charge. This battery pack is 5600mAh and perfect for cell phones and iPods, but not a good choice for tablets because it doesn't have enough capacity to charge one fully. It WILL charge a tablet - just not to 100%.The battery pack itself is very attractive, small enough to be extremely portable, and features 2 USB charging ports. It also functions as a flashlight but not well enough to be of any use. It comes with a micro USB to USB cable for charging the battery itself, but it's extremely short so I am using a longer cable I happened to have around the house. No carrying sleeve is supplied, but a wrist strap is included (that is a challenge to attach).The bright color and the two USB ports are what make this pack unique. One port is 1.0A and the other is 2.1A, which is a higher amperage needed to charge a tablet. However, you can also charge most cell phones using either amperage. The ports are marked in tiny print as to which amperage they are. I used a fine tip Sharpie to mark in larger print on the case, above the ports, which is which.The thing I like about this is I can charge 2 phones at one time. This is fantastic feature, particularly in business environments. My daughter purchased a couple of these because she conducts fairly long meetings every day and has these out for attendees to charge their phones during the meetings. She likes the bright colors and the ability to write her name in Sharpie on the case so they aren't likely to accidentally "walk off". You can fully charge 2 phones with a little juice to spare using this battery pack.If you want/need to charge a tablet, look for a battery pack that has at least an 1100mAh capacity - and more is better. I have a couple of the larger capacity battery packs just for tablet use. Mine are a few years old so are pretty big, but newer high capacity battery packs are not much larger than the one in this review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00D37M31Q" id="B00D37M31Q-review39" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-10:</strong> We've all had that experience when we're out and about and our phone has little to no charge, or we're on a plane and our Kindle decides it's time for a nap. A portable charger comes in handy at those times, but the Eagle Tech isn't always the right one to use. Why? It's heavier than that phone and even some tablets! It's also as big as a phone. I wouldn't carry this big guy in my purse, but I would take it for plane travel. It would be very handy in an airport or on the plane where there either aren't enough or any outlets to plug your phone charger into. But if you're traveling by car or Amtrak (they have lots of outlets on Amtrak trains), you won't need to use an external charger like this.The Eagle Tech charger can charge two devices at the same time, which is quite useful. When it was fully charged and my iPhone was nearly drained, I plugged it in and was surprised to see the iPhone fully charged in less than an hour. It used up about 25% of the Eagle Tech's capacity (the ET has four LED lights that indicate its level of battery power remaining, with each light representing 25%). When we then used it, with 75% power remaining, to charge my husband's nearly dead Kindle, though, the Kindle's indicator told us it only charged 42%. However, the bar on top seemed to indicate it had more of a charge than that, so I'm not sure how much it really charged. But that's still enough to get you through a shorter flight if you're reading on the Kindle and not playing graphics-heavy games.When not in use, it holds its charge quite well. We haven't used it in a week and it's still fully charged. It does not come with any charger cables (only the one it needs to charge itself), but it comes with a strap, which is nearly impossible to attach (the space for it is teeeeeeeeeeeeeeny tiny, but somehow my husband got it through). With it being bright blue, it is easy to find on a messy desk and would definitely be less likely to get left behind in a hotel!So I would recommend this for frequent travelers and for those who carry a briefcase that's already fairly loaded up (so you won't notice the extra weight). It would also be great for camping and for power outages, especially since you can charge one than one device at a time. But for everyday use, especially to be carried in a woman's purse or a student's backpack, I would instead recommend the Anker Astro Mini lipstick-sized charger:B005NF5NTKMy kids each have one and I'm ordering one for myself. It fits in a pocket and is very lightweight.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00D37M31Q" id="B00D37M31Q-review40" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-26:</strong> This is a great little battery pack!

It is compact which is nice and having a few of these type of devices means it is convenient to have one at the office or on vacation when you are out for an extended day (using GPS, camera, varying signal quality, etc.) and need to charge up a device on the go.So far no problems and the price isn't horrible.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00D37M31Q', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00D37M31Q', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00A2IXV06</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00A2IXV06</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A2IXV06" id="B00A2IXV06-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-11:</strong> Worked perfectly to fix a broken iphone that we had laying around.

I've been wanting to get a little GPS Bike Mount for my iPhone and came across Koomus BikeGo. This has been working perfectly for me so far. I'm using some apps to track my distance, so my phone has to actually be steady and safe during my rides and Koomus provides that stability. My boyfriend actually got one for his Motorcycle as well, because he likes to record his rides. So far so good! The grip is pretty tight and you won't feel like your phone is going to fall off, like with other mounts I've had before. I love that it's able to rotate 360 and you can actually take pictures or readjust whatever you need on your phone if necessary. Good purchase, affordable!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HRLEKG0" id="B00HRLEKG0-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-15:</strong> This mount is simple and sturdy. There isn't much to it but it seems to do the job really well. Went on a 3 mile bike ride the first night I got it which involves what I considered to be an average paved city trail with a good amount of bumps. Hit a bunch at 20 mph or so and the mount held my iPhone (in its normal case) tightly (I was worried it would pop out based on other reviewers). I did also have the phone in the vertical position. The safety bungee that plugs into the earphone jack is a nice touch. Because the mount uses the swivel ball, I think it provides enough shock absorbency too and with some decent bumps, the product doesn't move by itself which is great!The reason I give it 4 stars is that the initial adjusting of the device to fit the phone requires a lot of force. Thought I would break it as it was real stiff. To fit my iPhone 5 in its case I had to pull one arm out only a little bit.I just ordered a second one for my wife's bike. A great product.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HRLEKG0" id="B00HRLEKG0-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-24:</strong> I love using this Bike Mount Holder.

The bike mount does a great and has added features to accept a wide range of cell phones and handlebars sizes.The sides can be extended to firmly hold some of the biggest phones on the market. The inside of the grippers have a rubber insert, which enhances the grip. Also, there is a round rubber pad on mount that sticks to back of the phone to ensure the phone is held in place.There is a "Ball & Socket" joint that allows the phone to be positioned in the best viewable angle, even landscape mode.The base is affixed to the handlebar with a simple latch mechanism. There are retention three clips that can be changed to fit most bicycle handlebars. Supplied is a rubber anti-slip sleeve that goes between the handlebars and mounts to firmly keep your phone in place.Also, there is a safety pin to keep you phone from crashing to the concrete. This pin is inserted into the headphone jack port to give another protection method to your phone. The pin is attached to the mount via cord.I knew this was a great mount, since it was able to accommodate the large size of my Note 2. It works great when you are using your phone as a GPS to map your route.CONTENTS:Koomus BikeGo Bike Phone MountRetention Clips: Small, Medium, Large (1x)Rubber Anti-Slip SleeveSafety PinFEATURES:Phone Holding Size: 2.16 - 3.42in (54.86 - 86.86mm)I was supplied a sample for the purpose of review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HRLEKG0" id="B00HRLEKG0-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-14:</strong> This bike mount is tested by me and sticked even on harsh terrain downhill ride.

I just pay attention to the road and enjoy the scenery, life gliding by, sweet.

Took less than a minute to put on, holds well. However the side plates are very fragile and especially if you use it on landscape mode. The bottom holder literally fell out on the very first side walk I went down on. It's probably not an issue for smaller lightweight iphones, but for bigger android samsung phones it just didn't hold together for me. Gave it 2 star instead of 1 because of the safety pin, thankfully that at least saved my phone from dropping so it's a feature i like.Pros: Easy to install, safety pin is very usefulCons: Not suitable for big heavier phones</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HRLEKG0" id="B00HRLEKG0-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-30:</strong> This mount held both my iPhone and my boyfriends galaxy phones with great support.

But, as I typically do - I begin using things harder than I should and after removing my phone from this charger one day I wasn't as careful pulling it out and sure enough, the wire pulled away from the head of the charger and now I have a frayed wire.While I certainly don't fault the product itself - it was my fault.....I also feel confident that the Apple brand charger I have would not have broken so easily.

It is also unattractive, and, when the connection is made between the case and iPhone, the wire connector sticks out weirdly.  one of the qualities that attracts people to iPhones is the iPhone's sleek design.  This case completely changes the design of the iPhone to make it look like a brick.  to me, the cutout around the camera looks especially unattractive.  I would never have this case on my phone as a daily case.  potentially, I would have it as a spare case in my car or backpack to swap cases if I am running out of juice and I cannot recharge the phone at the moment.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CGY4JAU" id="B00CGY4JAU-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-29:</strong> The myCharge Freedom will revive and completely recharge my iPhone 5's battery for those times I am not able to plug in my phone to AC power. When I travel I normally take along a charging battery pack that will be able to fully charge multiple items. But when I am fishing on our boat, biking, or camping I don't want to take along all my gadgets and carry a heavy bulky battery pack. The myCharge fits securely on my iPhone and is completely open where the volume, vibrate switch, speakers, headphone and docking ports are. in order to remove the case, you have to push the iPhone out through the camera hole.This is by all means is NOT a low profile case. It actually doubles the width of the width and does add weight. For those reasons, I would not use this case as an everyday case. I would only use it for those times I know I will not be near power to charge my iPhone and need to use the myCharge for extra power on the go.I allowed my iPhone to reach 10% battery power and used the myCharge at a completely full charge to recharge my iPhone overnight. Once the iPhone was completely charged, it stopped charging and the battery life on the myCharge was left at 0-40%. That is enough power for at least another partial charge when I need it.The case comes with a micro USB cable for charging via computer USB port or it can be connected to an AC USB power adapter. I find it interesting that the case has it ports completely covered for protection but leaves the actual iPhone's open and exposed. The power button has to be pressed really hard in order for it to work since it is a raised button on the case.Overall, this is a great gadget to have for those times you need power on the go and do not want to deal with big battery packs. Just make sure you realize that it does add bulk and weight.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CGY4JAU" id="B00CGY4JAU-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-30:</strong> This is the 3rd battery case I've used and is my least favorite by a very wide margin. Any other option is preferable for me.It's the clunkiest case I've ever used. It doubles the thickness. It's the ugliest case I've ever used. The metal finish is cheap especially where it joins the plastic all around it and just looks bad. While the first problem is understandable, and the second is debatable, here's what inexcusable: the case offers 0 protection. If the lip of the case really protects the screen like the box says, it's by a millimeter at most. IE if you drop that phone face first the case is doing nothing. At all. It looks like it should offer more protection but my phone just doesn't fully seat. Leaving it virtually flush. (My phone is stock.) On top of that the power button is impossible to use. You have to punch it with your fingernail and tip if your finger because it doesn't protrude. And more often than not it doesn't work.Lastly the charging is kinda weird. Twice now I've come to find the case totally dead after fully charging and using it to partially charge my phone. It's mysterious to me. Is it not shutting off? Am I accidentally pressing the power button? Is it somehow not getting a full charge? Idk. But even assuming that's user error or a one off technical glitch there are so many other glaring issues you're better off getting a different case or separate battery.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CGY4JAU" id="B00CGY4JAU-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-17:</strong> I got this for my wife to use on her phone. She's not real picky so many of the issues observed by others didn't bother her. She only adds the case when she's out for the day. The battery adds enough juice to do the job, but I don't see how they can claim it doubles the battery life. It adds back about 85% on her phone, which, again, is enough if you are, say, on vacation and spending the whole day and night seeing the sights.This pack uses 2 different connectors: a standard micro USB going in and the Apple lightning connector going out. My wife got confused at first which one to plug the micro USB into. Her main complaint about the charger is that you have to press the button to see what level the battery is. The colors indicate if it needs a charge. If it does, then you need to press and hold the power button for 3 seconds. I don't know why they do it that way. I use an extra power pack on my S3 and I just have to plug it in and check at the color indicator.So, it's a clunky design that if you only use occasionally you can get by with, you have to figure out the plug and button pushing requirements, and the amount of extra battery life is enough, but not double. If it were my phone, though, I'd look for something better designed.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CGY4JAU" id="B00CGY4JAU-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-30:</strong> For the most part, I've been quite pleased with the myCharge Freedom 2000 Power Case. The primary reasons for my satisfaction are that this power case is easy to use and is reasonably attractive.Simply use the USB-to-micro USB cable to charge the device and, once charged, pull out the charging cable from its docking port embedded in the case's rubber outer layer and insert it into the iPhone lighting input. Press the button on the back of the case for three seconds to start the charge and you're good to go. In addition, to being easy to use, the myCharge's 2000mAh lithium polymer battery works quickly to charge the phone to enable you to have up to nine additional hours of talk time (up to seven extra hours for browsing). Besides it's being a very good external power source, the case is pretty attractive with its brushed metal back encased within a rubber outer layer.Be aware that using this case increases its weight as well as its thickness; which I imagine will be a negative for some people. For me, personally, it is not a problem; and, given the fact that I have large hands, I actually like the added thickness.My only concern pertains to how well the outer rubber layer will work to protect the phone from damage should the phone fall to a hard surface -- especially should the phone be dropped screen-side down, since the edges do not seem to be raised enough to provide sufficient protection. Luckily, I have not had to find out, first hand, if this concern is warranted or not. Hopefully, I never will. Only time will tell!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CGY4JAU" id="B00CGY4JAU-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-11:</strong> "The Freedom 2000 power case more than doubles your iPhone battery..." is the core promise made in the product advertising copy. The MyCharge Freedom 2000 Power Case does not live up to that promise.I've had this case for a month. The first few times I used it, it seemed to charge the iPhone 5 pretty well, but I wasn't able to give it a full stress test until this week on vacation. I charged the MyCharge, then a few days later connected the iPhone 5 when it got to 6%. The MyCharge gave the iPhone a full (and blessedly rapid!) charge back to 100%, but that was it. Subsequent testing confirms that the very best I am able to get is one full charge. So that core claim just isn't true.I am aware that battery testing is notoriously difficult. I didn't account for temperature, how long since I charged the MyCharge case, etc. But a consumer product needs to live up to its core promise under a range of circumstances, and this one didn't meet its stated promise once.Not recommended.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CGY4JAU" id="B00CGY4JAU-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-18:</strong> If you are looking for an extended battery case for your iPhone 5, this is an ok case. Basically, you put your phone inside the case and it acts as if it's an external power source to feed power into the phone. I was able to get about 4-5 extra hours of time on my phone (note that I don't use my phone to talk much, it's mostly email and web use).  A nice feature about this case is that it contains a "pass-through" lightning port, so you are able to connect your iPhone to a lightning cable to charge its internal battery and sync without having to take the case off. The bad thing about this is that the lightning cable only charges the internal iPhone battery.  To charge this external case battery, you have to use a separate USB cable and connect it to the separate USB plug.As for the design, yup it is bulky which takes away from the slimness of the iPhone.  But if you want the extended battery, you're going to have to make that trade-off.  On the other hand, the case isn't really the prettiest one I've seen.  The Mophie cases look better and sleeker than this one.  As for protection, I feel like this case would break easily compared to other cases.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CGY4JAU" id="B00CGY4JAU-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-27:</strong> This item increases your iphone 5's charge as advertised. But no one is using their iPhones these days to get extra "talk" time, so the "9 hours" talk time figure that is advertised on the packaging is more smoke and mirrors than anything else. With this, I realistically get an extra 7+ hours use out of my phone for data, games, apps and text usage. But, as is usually the case with any item marketed for its convenience, there are a few caveats that are mostly related to the still-wide gap between technology and usability & ergonomics when it comes to these types of phone accessories. The case is fairly heavy and thick considering it offers virtually no protection for the front of your iPhone. So it's really only half a case...if you drop your phone on its face, there could be trouble. Usually when you buy a heavy case, it offers sound protection for your phone. Not this one, but it's all part of the give-and-take for accessories like this: you forgo some protection in order to double your charge. Is it worth it? If the extra battery life is your main concern, I say yes. It came in handy in particular when I was at a concert and wanted to take a lot of footage. My battery used to die before I was done filming all that I wanted to film. Now I can make it through entire shows filming all the highlights and still have plenty of "juice" left for anything that happens afterward until I make it home. For everyday usage, it doesn't make a lot of sense for me to have this case because I work next to a computer and have my phone plugged right into my PC's USB port. But it is nice to have for special occasions when you know you won't be home or have your charger available (weddings, concerts, vacations, etc). If you can absorb the cost, it's worth it to have something like this if you always find yourself running out of battery with no charger/outlet available.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CGY4JAU" id="B00CGY4JAU-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-10:</strong> The appeal of a built-in battery case is evident to heavy users of the iPhone 5 like me.  I can never make it through a day without having to recharge my phone, especially after heavy texting or candy crushing!  This case is a great concept, because it allows you to extend your battery life 1+ full charge without having to have a USB-power source with you.  This is nice for when you are out and about or simply don't want to leave your phone tethered to a power source during the day.  You charge the case, then charge the phone using the included lightning connector plug.  The included lightning adapter swivels out from the phone which is nice.  (It's built in, so cannot be used for any other purpose).  You can charge both the phone and the case (micro USB) at the same time at night.Downsides:  it's bulky, which takes away from the sexiness of the iPhone 5.  Of course this is true for almost any case and the metallic finish does help.  The front edges are not raised above the screen, so it does not have very good front protection, particularly if dropped.  Also, 2000 mAH will get you some extended battery life, but for extended travel there are non-built in options for a similar price-point that will get you 10,000 mAH (3-4 charge cycles at least).  So it depends on your uses (if that sounds like a better solution, look up External portable USB battery and they can be had for $50).I had a Boostcase for my iPhone 4 and that seemed less bulky.  Overall this is a nice case, and I do like the built in power indicator.

The unit has a hard foam backing which is great for added protection against shocks and bumps. The back of the unit has a brushed metal finished which makes it looks more styley than the plain style covers.The Freedom 2000 is charged through a micro USB to USB connection and it powers the iPhone 5 by connecting a short lightning cable from the unit.

Where this item shines is on those occasions where you'll be away from any other options for charging (long plain ride, long daily public transportation commute, camping, even a day at the beach if you use your phone as a kindle and read or stream music). Having all the extra hours of power is priceless on a long flight with layovers, especially if you're traveling with children! So while I do think it definitely serves it's purpose, it doesn't do anything much else.I'd never dream of using this day to day since it's so grossly huge, it at least doubles the size of the iphone... looks wise it's fine, though I much prefer my phone in a more natural state (I use a LUVVIT clear case, which does have to be removed to fit this on but it only takes a couple seconds).All in all it's fine for what it is, but there might be other options that are a bit more budget or bulk friendly you should consider.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CGY4JAU" id="B00CGY4JAU-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-23:</strong> Yes, as another reviewer remarked, "it adds a bit of heft to your iPhone, but you can go a couple/three days without recharging."

You can still use it while it is charging in the power case and that's great... even better after it is recharged and you can slip off all that extra weight + I can then put it back into my belt clip.This will really come in handy during trips, when I might not have ready access to an electrical outlet... especially when camping. I'm not sure what it would take for me to give it 5 stars... maybe its own belt-clip, a little lighter, lightening fast recharging. My hopes may be too high... very good product as is.

My first reaction was "this is weird" but I understand the value now. Most battery cases take up your iphone's lightning adapter and thus you have to charge your phone / case with a separate micro usb cable. Not the end of the world but a trade off. With this case, you can actually charge the case and the iphone both at the same time (using 2 different chargers or cables) if you want to really charge up in a hurry. That's quite nice.The case is fairly thick so I don't use it all the time. I leave it in the car so I can use it as necessary.

It's easy enough to pop the iPhone in and out of this case. The charging unit uses the more standard micro-USB charger, so you can charge the case by plugging it into your computer, or a wall charger.

Plug it into a USB port to charge. Once you have a full charge you put your phone in it and when your phone battery is low you can charge your phone. The one big missing issue is that these cases don't balance out the existing charge in your phone so you aren't really doubling anything. This is simply a portable charger that acts as a case.As a case it's thick. I like the iphone because it's thin and fits in my pocket well. I like my iphone 5 naked but I do use cases from time to time. This one isn't terrible but it is heavy and thick.The charge is provided by a little dongle that swings out that you plug into the lightening port. Hit a button on the back and it starts charging. In a hour or less you should have a fully (or close to) charged battery.I've tried the Mophie cases and had the same thought - these are adequate.

To put that in perspective, the iPhone 5 itself has a 1440 mAh battery, so the myCharge adds quite a bit more battery life if you go by specifications. The case comes with a micro USB cable which you can plug into your Apple charger or computer etc. It does not come with a wall plug of its own.The case has a power button on the back (that you hold for 3 seconds to turn on and off), the micro USB port for charging the case/phone, and a slide-out Lightning cable that you have to maneuver into the phone to charge it. It's not what you'd call... graceful. And it's definitely chunky.It's certainly more of a battery than a case, though, and has a number of peculiarities that has me hesitate to recommend it if you're looking for iPhone 5 power and protection:1.) The way the myCharge Freedom 2000 works, is that it charges the iPhone 5 battery until it's full, and then the case shuts off its own battery. At that point, your iPhone 5 battery will drain as normal until you turn the case on again. I really don't like this method.The Mophie Juice Pack cases work completely differently to the myCharge 2000. With the Mophie cases, when you turn the case power on, it provides its own power to the iPhone until the case power itself is drained, leaving the iPhone battery full. Only at that point will it use the iPhone's own battery. I prefer the way the Mophie cases do things, since I know that my iPhone battery will start draining only when absolutely necessary, and not as soon the phone reaches full charge.(An example of this being an issue is if you leave your iPhone 5 charging overnight connected to the myCharge Freedom 2000. The case will charge the phone, and then shut off its power. That means by the morning your iPhone will not be at full charge since it's been using its own power when the case stopped providing charge. At that point you can turn the myCharge back on to charge your iPhone again, which is a nuisance. The Mophie cases work more like a regular Apple wall charger, charging the iPhone to full and then simply providing its own power until the case itself is drained).2.) The power button for your iPhone 5 is now hidden by the case. What myCharge have done is place an outer button on the case that presses the iPhone 5 power button when you press it. This works generally fine (though not as easily as one might hope) when the Lightning cable in the case is connected to the phone. If it's not connected, when you press that power button the iPhone 5 has a tendency to slide down in the case a little. I found it very difficult to press the power button (without the Lightning cable connected) unless I pushed up against the bottom of the case to prevent the phone being pushed down.It doesn't feel like the phone will fall out of the case when you press the power button, but it's definitely not something that conveys great confidence when you feel the phone move...3.) If you put your iPhone 5 face down, the screen will touch the table surface because there are no real lips around the screen from the case. All good cases should have something preventing the screen touching the surface of a table etc when set face down.4.) The back of the myCharge 2000 has a brushed metal finish, and this "Metal"-color model I have is very slimy to the touch after a minute or two of use. While the sides of the case are rubber, that slimy rear finish makes for a very slippery phone... It also scratches ridiculously easily.Overall, this case does what it says it will do, - and that is to charge your phone. It doesn't provide any protection to the screen at all, and it stops providing power to the phone a minute or two after the phone is charged which I find to be frustrating. You can do worse, but you can definitely do better.3 stars out of 5.*EDIT June 4, 2013*From a dead iPhone 5 battery (the phone shut itself off), a fully charged myCharge 2000 recharged me up to exactly 74% before it died. The iPhone 5 was not used during this period. Not very impressive given its 2000 mAh battery.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00CGY4JAU', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00CGY4JAU', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00BBHB8TS</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00BBHB8TS</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BBHB8TS" id="B00BBHB8TS-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-25:</strong> The case works great.

Once it is heated up the glass comes off pretty easy.  Most people say to use a heat gun or hair dryer.  I think my father has my heat gun so as a replacement I used my electric griddle which I set the temperature to 180degF, checked it with a IR temperature monitor and then sat the phone on it for a minute.  It worked very well.The hardest and longest part of the whole process was cleaning the digitizer and making sure there were streaks, or dust or whatever on it.  Some videos say to leave the adhesive but this comes with it so make sure you take it off from all around before you start cleaning the screen.  Once the digitizer is clean, put on the adhesive, verify the digitizer is still spotless and then apply the glass. Just to make sure everything sealed well I stuck it on the heat again for a few seconds and pressed everything firmly together.  Make sure that you have a cleaning cloth that will not leave behind dust and something to remove adhesive that won't leave behind a residue.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C1BKF3I" id="B00C1BKF3I-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-31:</strong> First of let me say that the screen and tools were exactly as described by the seller.

There was extra glue there that on one mentioned. As I lifted the old screen off which was entirely loosened everywhere else...the extra glue must have not been warm enough to release the screen and in the process it cracked my digitizer...After crying about it any trying to explain what happened to my son, he told me that was another video that explained how to remove the screen by removing the back and housing...this way there is a lesser risk if cracking the digitizer.... hard lesson learned. The good news is I still have the phone, the new screen and will purchase a new digitizer which my son has agreed to fix for me so I can have a replacement phone...lol.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C1BKF3I" id="B00C1BKF3I-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-30:</strong> It worked out well and so far I don't have any problems with it and it was easy to put on</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C1BKF3I" id="B00C1BKF3I-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-13:</strong> perfect.

The same is true of the speaker area, but I haven't had a problem with dust, there. The adhesive went in easily, though.Be aware that it's not the same as the thick layer of gunk that was on the original glass. As far as I can tell, though, that is not unreasonable, because you'd have huge difficulty installing that at home.I required support because the glass had gotten some writing on it, but they were there to back up their product and replacement glass eventually came (it took a while, and a reminder). The glass fit perfectly and feels right.All that being said, my phone looks like new, except for the small amount of dust that's creeping in through the button from time to time. I'll probably have to do it over and add some of my own 2mm adhesive or something. We'll see. I haven't seen anything else better, yet.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C1BKF3I" id="B00C1BKF3I-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-29:</strong> Everything you need to replace the broken glass on your phone.

But when I was about to installed it I noticed that it was not the Pebble Blue I ordered, it was RED... WHAT!! I was disappointed since I wanted the same color blue. I did not wanted to deal with all that "re send item crap" so I just went on and installed it. Let me tell you, the product itself is just great, everything matches. The cool thing about the color red that I like is the "settings" and "back" buttons, have this cool red color and looks nice in the dark, but I just don't like that is red, is not the kind of red I like, looks dull and old.One more thing, I noticed is that  when I get a message the LED light is soooo dim!!

I wasn't sure what to expect and I was a little bit nervous about breaking open such an expensive piece of equipment. But since it was only $20 I thought it would be worth taking the risk. My account was eligible for an upgrade anyway so if this didn't work I would just get a new phone. Follow the instructions and videos online and you should be fine. I did have a few tips based on my experience:- Use packing tape (or something similar) on the surface of the glass. This will make less of a mess when you lift the screen.- Be careful and go slow when trying to pry open the screen around the home button. There is some circuitry for the Menu and Back &#34;on-screen buttons&#34; and you could damage it if you're not careful.- After I lifted off the screen there was still some of the old glue remaining and I added glue that came with the repair kit as well. After putting the new screen on, I found that there was more space than there should be between the LCD and screen. My home button is slightly harder to press but the touch screen still works just fine. Its only a mild inconvenience for me but it could make a different in touch response to someone else. I would try to remove as much of the old glue as possible. If there is too much old glue left back, you probably don't have to use the new glue at all.Overall, this is a really great product and the kit has more than everything you need for an amateur to replace this on his/her own. You dont need the 2mm tape advertised with the product. A heat gun would be ideal for the job but I used a hair dryer and it worked just fine.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C1BKF3I" id="B00C1BKF3I-review24" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-06:</strong> it works fine. thick glass and all. did not take long to get to me fast shipment. color was spot on to orginal front glass.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C1BKF3I" id="B00C1BKF3I-review25" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-05:</strong> yikes. I thought I was good at fixing things - and this one, I blew it. Instructions and youtube videos make it seem simple. But those folks have done this multiple times and hence know what they are doing. For first timers, there is very little room for error. I thought I followed all instructions, got the infrared thermometers to make sure surface is heated to right level etc etc. Guess what? I thought I had pulled the glass correctly, until I reached the bottom and couldn't get the ribbon off the glass and eventually tore the ribbon.Only later, I found out that, I had pulled out not just the glass, but the digitizer with it. The heating of the glass wasn't separating the glass and the digitizer, but rather the glass+digitizer was separating from the LCD/AMOLED screen nicely. I had no clue. None of the videos (at least those that I watched) ever talked about this part. The lesson to learn for those who still want to go ahead: make sure when you start separating the glass at the very top, make sure what you are pulling out is a very thin glass only - if you see something else glued to it - stop instantly and keep re-heating...and all the best! glad it worked for some, but too bad for me :(. Now I have two choices: buy the glass+digitizer+LCD w/ frame and risk another repair, or, buy the Nexus 5 ($399 for 32GB)...I am leaning toward the Nexus 5.The other option for folks who are still in contract and don't have insurance etc: think of breaking the contract (pay the $250 or so fine) and then start a new contract with a new phone with a discounted price (depending on phone - $99 - $199)....I have posted some pics of my mis-adventures - so others can learn and be careful about it. My replacement glass kit is all new - if anyone wants it...</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C1BKF3I" id="B00C1BKF3I-review26" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-06:</strong> I used this kit to replace my very shattered screen.  It took a lot of patience, even with the right tools, but my screen looks great now.  Definitely watch the video that's mentioned on the pamphlet.  That was a huge help.$20 was a great price to fix my phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C1BKF3I" id="B00C1BKF3I-review27" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-26:</strong> Enough people have stated this is a great kit and they are just amateurs when it comes to replacing the glass. Well I am very tech savvy and somewhat mechanically inclined. Basically I'm not an expert in cell phone repair but I build computers and repair them, so I'm not your average consumer. That being said, I was a little disappointed in this kit as they reference you to a video of a replacement where the guy doesn't use this kit! He even links to what parts he bought.OK, so here's what you really need:- Patience- Heat gun or hair dryer- A small amount of 2mm tape (I used about 1/8" total)- Alcohol and soft microfiber cloth or alcohol pads- Prying tools: razor blade, exacto knife, plastic "prying tool"- Tweezers (bought 2mm tape that came with tweezers and cloth)First step is to remove the battery and memory card (and sim chip if you have one). I used a black and decker heat gun and made a critical mistake. Too much heat in one spot will mess up the LED screen. One of the videos warned about this but I did it anyway, now I have a 1" square area at the top that is messed up. It's less annoying than a cracked screen but makes me mad that I did it. For this, I would recommend to use a hair dryer or never place the heat gun within 6" of the phone. OK, it took about 4-5 minutes and my first step of heating went well (save the melted LED). I used a razor blade to start the removal and it came up easily. I then started with the plastic pry tool. Every couple of minutes I had to re-heat the glass, do so carefully. After about 10 minutes, the screen was up and off. Disconnecting the touch sensors at the bottom proved more difficult than the videos would let you believe. There's a buttload of tape on them and the tweezers proved very helpful in removing them from old glass. Once the glass came off, I used the alcohol & cloth to clean the LED screen. Once cleaned, I taped down the touch pad sensors, placed the new screen on the phone, pressed it in place, heated it a touch to take advantage of the residual glue, and it was good. Replaced the invisishield and it was like a new phone.Bottom line, careful with the heating up, take your time, watch as many videos as you can beforehand, there are subtle hints in most every video as to what to be careful of. Good luck!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C1BKF3I" id="B00C1BKF3I-review28" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-23:</strong> The tools were not up to the job, pick warps easily in heat and the pry tools flake and become jagged.

I figured worst case I break the phone then claim insurance on it for $150. That extra $50 plus $15 for this kit and $5 for shipping would make it a $70 mistake. I can live with that risk. After reading reviews I felt pretty comfortable. Like others say, make sure you remove the second film on the bottom of glass. That makes 3, 1 on top and 2 on the bottom. The absolute hardest part was getting all the old glue off. Seems like the more I cleaned the more there still was. Anyway, it was a snap other than that and the phone looks and more importantly functions like new.

But the button that you push to adjust the viewing angle popped out while trying to adjust the viewing angle the 1st day. Adjusting the stand was not easy or smooth. I could not simply push the button and rock the stand forward or backward for adjustments. So I had to actually take my tablet off of the stand, and guess at the angle I was trying to achieve. Ultimately after using the stand for several hours the button popped out, and though I did try to re-insert the button I could not get it to stay back in.Ultimately I would guess that I was just unlucky with the one I received, but quality control should have caught this problem before it was sent out. Especially since adjusting the button was hard to push, and adjusting the stand was so stiff and uneven.I would have given this stand a 5 star rating since I can't seem to find a case with variable viewing angles for my LG G Pad, but this one is going back.After the review customer service from TechMatte made contact with the following response."TechMatte Customer Support says:Thank you for your review. It sounds like you have received a defective item, and we apologize for the inconvenience. To claim your One Year Replacement Warranty, please email our support team at the address listed within the packaging or message us through Amazon, and we will be able to process your request.Thanks,TechMatte Customer Support"I returned the stand for a refund that was processed quickly, and ordered another stand made by a different company. The other makers stand is lighter, and arrived with no defects. But the fact that customer service made an effort has caused me to raise my rating by 1 star to 3. I actually liked the weight of the TechMatte stand, but in viewing the reviews it seems there have been complaints about the quality control of this item. I have purchased other items from TechMatta that were fine, but in this case the stand was not finished well, and the button popping out within the first day does not give me a great deal of confidence in their products when it comes to future purchases.BTW I see that someone decided that my review was not helpful...

I was expecting a lightweight stand, but was really surprised at how heavy and solid it was when I took it out of the box. It's the type of stand that I get the impression that I could run over with my car and not damage it. The hinge and the "kick stand" portion are made of plastic, but they also feel substantial.The angle is set by depressing a button in the hinge area. It's very easy to adjust, and the hinge has click stops at various angles that hold it securely.What is not adjustable is the depth of the cutout that holds the tablet or phone. I didn't have any problems with it holding a variety of tablets (iPad, Kindle and Nexus). It won't, however, hold some tablets that have a skin on it. The cutout that holds the table is slanted, and is 10mm at the widest point at the top, and 8mm at the narrowest point at the bottom. You'll want to measure your tablet plus skin to make sure it fits.The cutout for the tablet has a plastic non-skid insert that works well. The stand itself also has plastic nubs on the back to prevent scratches on the tablet, and nubs on the bottom to prevent scratches on the table top. The nubs also act as non-skid points.Very solid build quality, very easy to adjust in a variety of angles, and the design ensures that there won't be any damage to the tablet when you take if off/put it on the stand. As long as the width does not present a problem, this is a great choice for a tablet stand. Highly recommend.[Sample provided for review]</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HHEAMXC" id="B00HHEAMXC-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-20:</strong> When I bought this heavy duty stand I knew going in that is primarily made to hold the iPhone and iPad devices (without an Otterbox), yet I found that it will work on other brands such as Samsung and I will list below which Samsung phones that this stand will accommodate well (this will include several models of tablets and phones that fit into this stand).  In addition, below I list in the PROS my actual test findings and more info on this stand as to the features of it:PROS:+ Several Adjustments (to many eye levels) - This can be easily adjusted on so many levels so you can angle your phone to whatever viewing level you want to. This stand has the most adjustments for any stand that I have ever used.+ Charging my devices in this stand (and using them at the same time) - Since there is no open space on the bottom of this stand in which to insert a charger, I just place my phone or tablet in landscape and keep it in the stand and charge it this way. Then I can still use the stand (in landscape) while it is charging when it is in need of a charge).+ Sturdiness / Build Quality / Appearance - Because this stand is heavier than most other stands, and the fact that it is wider than most stands, plus the rubber grippers on the bottom of the stand, it will not slide around like most other stands do. Since the color is silver, it has that more professional and classy appearance when sitting on your desk at work or in a home office etc. This case has that classy designer look totally!+ Devices I tested that fit into this stand (including my Tab 2's and TAB 3 which all fit perfectly in portrait and landscape perfectly in this stand).(While iPhone and iPad (without case) fits well into this stand, for me, I own Samsung devices, so I tested them and give my test results):* Samsung Galaxy S4 YES even with a silicone cover on the phone - the phone fit almost all the way down to the bottom of this case (there is just very tiny gap that I noticed when looking sideways at the fit). However, because this stand has an inside all rubber gripper on it, my S4 fit into this securely even with the silicone cover. **It will not fit if you have the S4 in an Otterbox though. Good news! If you have a barely there case of the S4 or no case on it, it will go all the way down into the stand in portrait mode.It does go all the way down in the stand in landscape mode.* Samsung Galaxy Grand Duos - With a barely there back type of case (thin cover) on it fits most of the way down, but down enough in the slot to feel secure. If no case is on the Grand, it fits in portrait all the way down into the stand. In landscape with the thin case on it, it fits all the way down into the slot in this stand. It will not fit if you have an Otterbox on the Grand.* Samsung Galaxy S3 - Fits well with a slim barely there back case. Fits well without a case.* Samsung Galaxy S2 - In portrait mode: With a slim barely there cover, it went part of the way down into the slot and felt secure. With a TPU case or silicone case, it kind of went down, but not as secure as I liked. Without a case, however, it went all the way down into the slot. In landscape and in barely there cover, it did go most of the way down with the slim barely there back case.* Samsung Galaxy Player 4.2 with barely there back case. Fits perfectly and goes all the way down into the slot on this stand.* Samsung Galaxy Player 5.0 - Without a case, this player fit most of the way down into the slot in Portrait mode. With a thin, barely there type of cover, no, it did not fit well in portrait mode, yet in landscape mode, it went all of the way down in the slot even with a cover on it.* Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 (without a TPU cover). The tablet fit very well into this stand and went fully into the slot both in portrait and landscape positions. Since the Tab 3 7.0 and 10.1 are thin in depth, they should fit fine as well.* Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (both the 7 and 10) tested both (without any TPU cover) and each one fit perfectly into the slot in portrait and in landscape.* Samsung S3 MINI - I tried this both with a TPU cover and with no cover and there is NO WAY that I would recommend this phone with this stand because of the very rounded edges design of the S3 Mini. If you own this phone and need a stand, then I suggest this one: iKross Universal Folding Stand, which has a deeper slot and the S3 Mini fits perfectly into this stand.Highly recommend this wonderful stand (with the included drawstring carrying bag) and it should work even if you have an non Apple device, IF the depth is thin and it is a newer phone (the new phones are getting thinner and thinner).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HHEAMXC" id="B00HHEAMXC-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-21:</strong> This little stand measures only 4" x 3" x 1/24" when folded flat, yet it provided a solid base for everything from a full-size iPad to a Kindle to a smartphone. It is the perfect size to stash in a bag when I'm traveling. Of course, if something like this is sturdy, it's going to weigh a lot for its size: 6 ounces, or almost half a pound. I consider this dense weight important to the stability of the stand since the last thing I want to see happen is my iPad toppling over when I poke at the touch screen. The iPad stays put even in portrait mode, although I admit to being a little nervous when I use that orientation on such a small stand.I like that you press a button on the side of the hinge to unlock the support and that a simple release locks it in place. I can get any angle I want -- none of this "three position" restrictions of many other stands. This means that I can look down, straight, or up at my device from a variety of angles and still be able to view it. I also appreciate the two small rubberized pads at the back of the stand; they function both as protection from scratches and as a stabilizer so the device doesn't slip free.This stand is great to have handy for travel and in the home to easily support a device from one place to the next. Note: I received a sample for review.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HHEAMXC" id="B00HHEAMXC-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-07:</strong> I know there are some people out there that like to keep their gadgets "naked" or have a slim non-folio case. So a good durable stand is something that would be needed. There are many stands out there and I've trade quite a few of them but this is one of my favorites so far.*Build Quality*First its mostly made out of aluminum with plastic and rubber. It has a nice matte metal finish to it. It not some cheap thin easily bendable stand. It feels rock solid, has a good weight to it and won't bend under any normal circumstance.The back "foot" that the stand leans on is made out of plastic. It doesn't raise much concern as its a thick piece of plastic that seems to hold its own.There are rubber feet to stop the stand from sliding around when doing hand gestures on the tablet. Also, there are rubber cushions on the front ( where the tablet would lean against) and in the "cup" where the tablet would sit in. It's nice to know that there are cushions and measures taken to prevent unwanted scratches from the stand to the tablet.The stand is roughly the size of a wallet when folded up.*Functionality*Its small enough to carry around in a bag and light enough where you wouldnt notice it. Also, I know some of us have more than one tablet and one of those tablets might be a ipad. The cup has a u cutout so the user could have easier access to the home button on the front of an ipad.At the sides, there is a round button that can be pressed to set the angle of the stand. Only the left circle is a button while the circle on the right side isn't.*Conclusion*For the price, its a great choice for the people that like to keep their devices "naked".</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HHEAMXC" id="B00HHEAMXC-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-16:</strong> Very high quality and great design.

But, this is a very interesting product and I will tell you why later on. Oh yeah! You can purchase this product via Amazon US for about $10 (with S&H;) and special thanks to TechMatte for sending this out to review!As the year was kicked off I find that TechMatte is overseeing their competition mistakes, flaws, and set backs. They are taking all of that into account to produce products that will change the way you interact with your product and a daily basis. When you purchase and receive yours you will be presented with the stand itself, paperwork, and even a carrying case. Personally, I find that the carrying case is not the best quality but for this price you can't complain. Many other companies, such as Anker, didn't include a carrying case with their stand. Great job to TechMatte!Now I want to quickly inform you about the pros, cons, and conclusion of this product mainly because I produced a video that actually goes into deeper detail and even a video that compares it to the competition; in this case it's Anker.Right away, I love the ability to place any of my devices on it in order to view photos, watch videos, and much more. I actually tested this product with my Samsung Galaxy S4, Nokia Lumia 810, Apple iPod touch 4th Generation, and even an ASUS Nexus 7 (1st Generation). The overall performance was pretty much perfect. The Lumia 810 is actually thicker and as thick as the Nexus 7 which restricted the area that it would fit in due to them not being as slim as the Galaxy S4 and iPod touch.Either way there is a hard rubber texture inside the stand as well as on the stand itself. Due to being aluminum that gives you the chance to cause damage to your product if it didn't have the hard rubber protection. Also, I'm no fan of the dark grey color scheme and would prefer a different color but that's no deal breaker for the average consumer.Talking about the movable stand itself I find that the perfect angle was about 45-degrees which is optimal for viewing multimedia if you're relaxing in a chair, sofa, couch, and so on. Otherwise, you can vary in angles to suit your needs and wants. That's the main feature that performs very well thanks to the button on the left side of the product. It's not too noticeable to the point that it looks like a &#34;sour thumb&#34; when it's sitting on your desk.In conclusion, I love the stand and every feature that's built in. I highly recommend watching my  review and comparison video before purchasing to insure that you are fully aware of the pros and cons. Once again, excellent job TechMatte.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HHEAMXC" id="B00HHEAMXC-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-05:</strong> Pros:Very sturdy stand with various angles that can be set.Holds my Ipad Air solidly.Comes with nice carrying pouch.Folds flat for easy carrying.Cons:Initial product had some defect on the finish.

The back rotates and locks into position for viewing at different angles. Although the back of the stand locks into position, there appear to be fixed detents around 20, 45, 70, and 90 degrees. It's possible to place the back in any position, however, but in the non-locking positions, it could possibly rotate if bumped hard enough.I used the stand with my smartphone and my Kindle Fire HDX 7&#34; tablet. My smartphone is in a thick rubberized case that would not fit in the curved slot at the base of the stand, but it did sit securely on top of the slot. My tablet is in a slimline cover, and when I opened the front cover, the tablet and the back cover slid nicely into the slot. Both the phone and the tablet worked well in both the portrait and landscape orientation. With some tablets, it may be necessary to remove them from a cover for them to fit in the slot.Note that I only tested the stand with a typical sized smartphone and a 7&#34; tablet. The stand appears to be heavy enough and sturdy enough to work with larger tablets without tipping over, but I was not able to test a larger tablet.This is a very handy stand for cellphones and tablets. It's durable, and it's small enough and light enough to carry easily in a purse or backpack.A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HHEAMXC" id="B00HHEAMXC-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-17:</strong> This is no lightweight stand.

The advantage of this stand is that some of the lighter, smaller ones can tip or blow over. This is is heavy enough to stay put. There are small plastic feet to hold it in place on a slick surface.If you are dissatisfied with flimsy stands, this one be an improvement.

But it does. It worked great with my Kindle Fire and my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 in horizontal or vertical positions. The lip at the bottom is a little thin but both devices sat firmly but only without their cases. My smartphone fits with a case though.The adjustable leg locks in place and is opened by pushing a release on the hinge. It has about 6 lock spots for great flexibility of use. It is perfect for sitting on a firm surface for reading, following a recipe, watching a video etc but is not large enough to be stable on a soft surface. It is finished nicely and folds flat for storage.

It weighs 6 ounces, the same as my iPhone 4S in its case.  The stand comes with a nice velvet drawstring pouch for easy transport, though I'd prefer just to leave it on my desk.I love that the stand can hold all my devices at any angle, from fully upright to nearly flat.  Even though it's small (3" x4"), it can hold my 9 inch Android tablet and my Kindle Fire HD 8.9" tablet in either landscape or portrait position without toppling over.  If the devices have thin cases, I don't even have to take them off.  The only case that didn't fit was a children's silicone bumper style case on our OXO 7 inch Android tablet.I like it.

It's made of nice looking silver coated aluminum complemented by dark gray plastic. Definitely looks good enough to take out at a business meeting.2. This is easy to use. Just push in the plastic button on the top left and you can adjust the sturdy plastic stand to whatever angle you like. Unlike some cheap flimsy plastic stands that I have received, this plastic stand is 1/8 inch thick and will not collapse once you set it.3. This nicely holds in place my iPhone 4S (fits perfectly for watching You Tube videos in landscape mode), iPad 3 and Nexus 2013 tablet.

All in all it's nothing big enough for the average person to notice and I was impressed with the over all quality (one issue aside). For my purposes this was almost perfect. Make sure you remove the lens plastic before installation, it is located on the under side.Installation was a breeze, take off the screws (If you have the silly star pattern, do yourself a favor and but the right tool) slide it up, put the new glass on and slide it down. Towards the end of installation I discovered only one of the set screw mounts was properly threaded. The left side (if the phone is laying, face up) seemed to be over bored. I can see it is threaded, but the standard Iphone screws are too thin and slide right past the threads. I tried this with several different iPhone screws and they all slide past the threads. I also checked to make sure all these screws to work with the right side mount, and the OEM mounts.This was the ONLY problem, and not a huge deal for me. Those screws are there to prevent the back from sliding up and fall off. I always use a case anyhow and with one screw securely in place the back glass wont be going anywhere. If you plan on using your phone without a case this may be something to consider.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BBN5MEY" id="B00BBN5MEY-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-01:</strong> Fit was a little off, but nothing that broke the deal.

HTC has designed this phone beautifully and almost the entire front of the device is filled by the screen. The bezel on the left and right side is almost nonexistent. This phone is gorgeous. The screen has a resolution of 480x800 which by today's standard is a bit low but you will be hard pressed to even realize this during everyday use. The Windows Phone OS looks fantastic on this screen and text is very easy to read. Videos and pics look outstanding and the super LCD really nails the correct colors accurately. You will love this screen.Under the hood the Titan is powered by a 1.5 GHz single core processor. I am not sure why other OS's require dual core processors because Windows Phone OS runs buttery smooth on this phone. No matter what I throw at this phone nothing slows it down. Microsoft has really done a wonderful job keeping this OS lightning fast.You get 16 GB of storage which for me is plenty. I have a ton of apps, games, music and videos on my phone and still have 9 GB free. Unfortunately there is no memory card slot so the 16 GB is all this phone will ever have. You do get access to 25 GB of free storage on Microsoft's SkyDrive which is integrated well in to the OS so you can always store your pics and docs in the cloud if you run low on storage.ATT markets this as a 4G phone but it isn't true 4G LTE but just the HSPA+ network which is still plenty fast. In Boston my average download speed is right around 4Mbps a second. Not too shabby at all. The call quality so far seems top notch but quite honestly I have only made a few. The signal strength in Boston isn't that great to begin with so at times I am running with only 2 bars of strength. It doesn't seem to impact calls or the internet so as long as things run well I do not care how many bars I have. It is something I will pay close attention to in the coming days and will update my review if things take a turn for the worse. So far things are fantastic though.The sound on this phone is great. It can get VERY loud when using headphones so be careful how far you crank up the volume. The external speaker is quite good for a phone but can get a little distorted when you max out the volume. The phone does not come with ear buds so you will need your own set. This really isn't an issue as most of the earbuds that come with phones are junk but I did find it odd that none were included.I don't want to talk about the OS too much as this is a phone review but for those who have not used Windows Phone yet you will be amazed at how awesome it is. This is the future of mobile now. Once you use this OS going back to iOS or Android is very hard and you will wonder to yourself how you ever got along without Windows Phone and it's brilliant Live Tiles and super smooth operation.While the app store is not nearly as large as Apples or Googles I have found that almost every app I used on my iPhone 4 has a counterpart on Windows Phone. You will also find the Windows Phone versions of your favorite apps look, feel and operate better than the ones on iOS. Wait to you open apps like USA Today or IMDB. They are truly magnificent. If you are a gamer and own an XBOX 360 then you really should be on Windows Phone as XBOX Live is integrated right in the OS and compatible XBOX Live games on Windows Phone include achievements so even on the go you can get those glorious little achievement notifications that some people have become addicted to!That is it for now. I have to get back to playing with my new phone! If you have any questions please feel free to leave comments on my review and I will try to answer them as soon as possible.UPDATE 11/24/2011 - I have had the Titan now for a couple of days and my opinion that this is a fantastic phone is just getting stronger. The battery life is outstanding. I took it off the charger yesterday and used it quite heavily the entire day and when I went to sleep at 11:30 PM I still have about 9 percent left. This phone will easily get you through an entire day.I have also now played with the camera and can say that the 8 megapixel camera takes great photos. Outside in daylight is where this camera really shines. I took some panoramic shot with the built in software and they came out quite awesome. The colors were very accurate. The video recorder works very well too and I got some great outdoor footage in glorious 720p. Taking pics inside the house at night with the flash on hurts the quality a bit but I still think the inside pics look a lot better than the ones I take on my iPhone 4. I think you will be quite happy with the camera's performance.UPDATE 11/25/2011 - Office is absolutely awesome on the Titan. While you don't get to see more of your documents on the screen compared to smaller phones due to the resolution what you do get are documents that are much easier to create and edit. I have noticed this especially while using Excel as each cell is much bigger and easier to manipulate. This phone just keeps getting better and better.UPDATE 12/03/2011 - 4G speeds. After researching 4G speeds on wpcentral.com it appears that AT&T; may be throttling their Windows Phones. In Boston where we have HSPA+ speeds I should be seeing twice the download speeds that I am currently getting. I still average around 4 Mbps which is fine for just about everything I have done so far but it sure would be nice to be up around 8. I am still leaving the review at 5 stars because the phone is still incredible but this is something you may want to consider if you are planning to switch over to AT&T;.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0068PZQT6" id="B0068PZQT6-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-12-13:</strong> I was first in non-existent line on Day One for the Samsung Focus and later had a Dell Venue Pro. Windows Phone Mango is by far the sweetest, slickest and intuitive mobile OS out there, but this is the first real, lust-worthy Windows Phone that does it justice. Everything about it is absolutely gorgeous. It's easily pocketable, don't worry about it being too big. You don't even realize what a monster screen it has until the screen fires up and dazzles with incredible color and pitch blacks. The HTC Hub and Photo Enhancer are much more useful than the Samsung apps on the Focus. Top-notch camera, decent battery life (a day) and the loudest and clearest speakers on a mobile device since the Blackberry Bold 9000.

Upgrading from a Samsung Focus, I decided to stay with the Windows Phone devices because they are fast, reliable, and fun to use. I've owned an iPhone 3G and a Samsung Captivate (Android 2.1) in the past, but I prefer the setup of Windows Phone 7.5 overall for my cellphone needs.To make this review easier to navigate, I'll break it down into some of the features I consider most important about this device...1) SIZE & SCREEN: Okay, the first thing I noticed about the HTC Titan is that it's one BIG PHONE! Sporting a 4.7" Super LCD screen, the Titan made my old Samsung Focus (4" Super AMOLED screen) look like a toy! Even though the Titan has a large screen, I still find it comfortable to hold, because the body is pretty thin. While waiting for a phone case and holster to arrive from Amazon, I've been carrying it comfortably in my jean and jacket pockets without any problems. You will hear plenty of folks complain about the Titan's lower screen resolution (480 x 800) compared to Android and iPhone devices, but I don't think it's a problem. Everything displays sharply and well-lit on the Titan and sometimes I casually display it in the presence of iPhone and Android users, just to get a reaction ("Hey, look at THAT!"). Anyway, its like having a 60" 720p HDTV (Titan) and comparing it to a 32" 1080p HDTV (iPhone/Android)... give me the BIGGER SCREEN everytime! Bottomline: the Titan has a large, beautiful screen which looks great compared to other phones. Ignore the haters!2) PROCESSOR SPEED: The snappier 1.5GHz Processor on the Titan compares favorably to other phones! For those who are considering high-end Android devices or an iPhone 4S just because they have dual-core processors, rest assured that the HTC Titan is no slouch when it comes to speed. Overall, I noticed no slowdown while using my device to run apps, games, or videos. Windows Phone 7.5 doesn't currently support dual-core processors, but there really isn't a need at this point.3) 16GB MEMORY: Okay, this area is really a shortcoming, in my opinion. Why did HTC only install 16GBs on this beast? Even my old Samsung Focus was expanded to 40GB of memory space! Microsoft needs to really raise the bar in this area, in order to stay competitive. If we are supposed to load our phones with content, why not give us the extra storage space to do it?! Bottomline: HTC needs to expand the storage space to at least 32GB.4) WINDOWS PHONE 7.5 (MANGO): The Windows Phone operating system is a complete joy to use. Using a home-screen comprised of tiles, you can start your favorite apps pretty rapidly with this device. Multi-tasking is similar to the iPhone in everyday use. Just press and hold the "arrow key" on the phone and you will see screenshots of previously used apps or functions displayed like a row of playing cards. Tap the "card" of your choice and you'll be back in that program in a flash! Windows Phone 7.5 also offers great features like Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, Microsoft Office, Xbox LIVE, and Bing integration. Want voice recognition software? Just push and hold your "Windows key" and you can issue a large number of commands to your phone (i.e. "Call Lisa", "Local Weather", "Open Office", etc). Microsoft Office integration is greatly improved on Windows Phone. You can access numerous Office files (Word, Excel, OneNote, and Powerpoint) by storing them on your phone or syncing with an outside source like Office 365, Skydrive, or Windows LIVE! Speaking of Windows LIVE, you can import your contact list and appointments in a flash with this operating system.5) TURN-BY-TURN NAVIGATION/GPS: I had a chance to use the turn-by-turn navigation on this device and its pretty good! You can pair your device to your car's Bluetooth connection (if equipped) and hear the commands over your radio speakers. Miss your turn? Tap anywhere on the map and you'll receive updated directions!6) 4G SPEED: Hey, this Windows Phone has 4G speeds using HSPA+ networks! Try that, iPhone lovers!7) WINDOWS MARKETPLACE: Not something specific to the Titan, but it definitely bears mentioning. As of this writing, the Windows Marketplace has over 40,000 apps available for download. Sure, its not near the numbers available on the iPhone or Android devices, but its still a significant number. You will find popular apps in the marketplace, like Weather Channel, Amazon, Kindle, Netflix, Google Search, and a ton of other useful apps. Most apps offer a "trial mode", so you can try them out before purchasing. AT&T; will let you buy them using a credit card or by adding it to your phone bill. Look up "Windows Marketplace" online and check out the selection for yourself!8) HTC APPLICATIONS: The Titan also has some great apps available for FREE from the manufacturer! I downloaded a Skype-like application (Tango), YouTube viewer, LED flashlight app, weather hub, and calculator.9) 8MP CAMERA/720p CAMCORDER: The Titan has an awesome 8MP camera with auto-focus and multiple settings. Additionally, it has twin LED flash and a camcorder capable of 720p resolution! AWESOME!!Well, I could go on and on about this device, but I'll bring it to a close. If you want to try something different (Windows Phone 7.5) and don't mind having one of the BIGGEST phone screens around, check out the HTC Titan! Its a great phone and I give it my highest recommendation!UPDATE: If you are interested in using Skype on this device, it isn't currently available for Windows Phone. However, Microsoft acquired Skype this year for $8.5 billion, so we should see a Windows Phone version soon. In the meantime, the Titan has a 1.3MP front-facing camera and supports a program called Tango. This program is similar to Skype in functionality and is supported on the PC, iPhone, Android devices, and Windows Phone.UPDATE (10/28/12): Just wanted to mention that Skype is now available for Windows Phone. Additionally, these Windows Phone 7.5 devices are expected to receive an upgrade to Windows 7.8 in the very near future. Although this phone will not be upgradeable to Windows Phone 8, it will still enjoy some of the same features which are not hardware dependent. I would still recommend this phone to anyone, because it is still awesome! The 4.7" screen still trumps the iPhone 5... HOOAH!!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0068PZQT6" id="B0068PZQT6-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-26:</strong> Searh for "Terrible Call Quality" in google and first link will show up...device has basic call quality issue, bluetooth implementation sucks, bad internmet access and several places where other phones are able to get signals Titan is not seeing signals, and this is when it claims to be 4G phone....Iphone 3gs was giving me much better and smooth experience in those areas....If you can sustain with these issue phone is superb, top screen, Mango is just cool os, very sleek looking and good camera....I am using it from day 1 and got several complains about other person had issue hearing me....Update: 03112012Hotspot is another issue if you are using hotspot for over an hour and then try to make a call, it wont call at all (phone is getting hot)if you started hotspot surfing internet  on laptop, then try making a call and laptop internet gets disconnected, why?</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0068PZQT6" id="B0068PZQT6-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-14:</strong> I am as huge of a WP fan as you will find.  I am a great cheerleader for the OS.  It is the best of both worlds:  You can customize, remove, and adjust your homescreen, shortcuts, and app selection as you want.  It is a fantastic user experience- seamless, smooth, and a fun time.  I love the Office tools, the calander is one of the most useful there is, it incorporates your email and social sites so amazingly well, and is a great media/internet experience.That is why the Titan is such a let down.  Call quality is as poor as you can imagine.  There is echoes, garbled reception, and callers on the other end almost can not understand the speech at all.  We have had 4 Titans and this has been true of all of them.  2 of them did not load sites correctly, one had a screen that stopped working, and another would not allow email updates.We purchased the device in November of 2011 so this is a long term problem.  I can not recommend it.  We got the HTC Titan 2, and the call quality was much better, though still not a strength.  We have had no problems with it.  Please avoid the Titan for your own sanity.  If you are in love with the 4.7" screen and like HTC, the T2 is a much better option.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0068PZQT6" id="B0068PZQT6-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-12-20:</strong> I won one of these in a contest, not that it matters as I would have happily paid for it and was up to that point planning on doing so.

The screen is amazing, the software is so fast and responsive, and the interface and hubs have made everything I need so easy and fast to get to.  I don't know how I lived with out these hubs pulling in all my stuff, organizing it, and putting it right at my fingertips.  I was not a facebook person before but the integration with this system is so easy and rich that it sucked me in.

It looks stylish.On the sides, the finish is glossy and is eye-catching, especially the black.Cuts are precise. It's got a jagged feel on the lines. Buttons molds are perfect. Volume buttons are accessible. The silent switch (most important part!) gives enough space to easily flick the button.Well done, yet again, Totallee.

I know what I want, but no one has even able to give me a case that I think is perfect. Finally, this case comes very close.This is a hybrid case that combines soft TPU sides with a hard polycarbonate back. It has a small lip on the case so you can feel safe that the screen is protected. It also allows the phone to have a very slim profile, with an easy grip and access to all ports.What I really love is that it has a clear matte  back so I can actually, finally, see my beautiful IPhone! I have found most cases with clear backs are not really &#34;clear&#34;, but this one is.Also, it does not remove or scratch my screen saver, which is a real plus to me.It looks like I have found a new favorite case.

I apologize for the rhyme but this is a new take on an older model which I own and love:TOTALLEE Slim Skin iPhone 5 / 5S Snap On Hard Shell Case Comfort Grip (Black). The balance between minimalism and protection are still incorporated into the design, but the back is frosted and the color scheme is blue. To extend my trite opening, this 2014 model is a marriage of good design and aesthetics.I was provided with a review sample by the manufacturer, in part I am sure, because of how much I loved the older model. Since most folks are probably not familiar with the older design that this one shares I'll rehash the key points:PROTECTION: The rigid case is strong enough to protect against hard surfaces and objects, but is also pliable and capable of absorbing (or at least mitigating) shocks from short distance drops. In addition the top part of the face is raised above the phone's screen.  If you drop your phone on a flat, hard surface the raised lip of the case will provide some protection for your screen. Of course,  all bets are off if you drop it on an uneven surface like gravel or rocks. This is a case that is more at home indoors than one whose owner participates nin rigorous activities.CONSTRUCTION: Pliable, shock absorbing material surrounding your phone, with a hard (and still slightly cushioned) back.FUNCTION: Everything fits as though this was an integral part of the phone itself. This is especially true of the camera and flash. If you previously owned an iPhone 4 you will especially appreciate the improved camera performance of the 5 or 5S in this case. Plus you can use your screen up to the very edge, something other cases do not allow.Here is what this one has that trumps the older model: aesthetics. The color is certainly not boring. It's vivid in fact. And the frosted back still allows the Apple logo to show, but the frosting adds texture and depth.The bottom line, though, is this case provides more protection than you would guess at a glance, and is more than just a pretty face at the altar.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IMJQ1P4" id="B00IMJQ1P4-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-17:</strong> As usual I received this case for free in exchange for a review but despite that kindness I'll still be honest about the product.Just a few bulletpoints* Remember, this isn't heavy-duty case; this is a simple light-weight case that's designed to save your phone from simple bumps and bruises.  Not allow it to survive being run over by a car.* Case is stiff and sturdy, bendable but giving good protection.* Case extends over the front face of the phone a bit to protect the screen* Has cut-outs in all the right places and is thin enough on edges that you can plug in headphones, charger etc.* Buttons on the side for volume adjustmentIn summary, a nice minimal case and cheap enough that you can color-coordinate with your dress for the evening.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IMJQ1P4" id="B00IMJQ1P4-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-14:</strong> The TOTALLEE frostback case is a protective case for your iPhone 5s that is semi-transparent so you can show of the color you chose for your phone, while offering what I would call three levels of protection. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good case and doesn't need a fully transparent back. If you need fully transparent, I would instead recommend the TOTALLEE Clearback, also available on Amazon.The three layers of protection are this:The back of your phone is protected from scratches. If you put this on your phone, when you remove it the phone will look just like it did the day you put it in the case.The sides are grippy, meaning you have a better hold of the phone when you are doing whatever it is you do with your phone, from typing to game playing to movie watching to anything else.The last piece is that the grippy sides extend slightly above the surface of the phone. Now your screen is protected from scratches from sliding it across a table or other surface. This won't necessarily protect it when you drop the phone or something, but now you don't need to worry about placing it face down or face up on a surface.The back is frosted. The plastic they used doesn't feel as grippy as the clearback case TOTALLEE makes, so maybe that's another reason to look at the other case? I don't mind for my phone, but if you want the best grip, the Clearback is the... clear choice.Installation is snap on easy. Take it out of the baggy it ships in, slide your phone into it and you are done. All of the phone's buttons are easy to use. You can easily plug headphones in with no extender, you can charge just as you would without a case and photos are NOT obstructed in any way by the case.Recommended.I received a free sample for review purposes from the manufacturer.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00IMJQ1P4', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00IMJQ1P4', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B009PJN1U8</h2>    <p class="price"> $B009PJN1U8</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009PJN1U8" id="B009PJN1U8-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-03:</strong> This pen feels good to the hand and works great on my 10.1.

Basically galaxy note itself covers most of inconveniences when using device, so wacom touch pen has no special features like other stylus.If i were asked what was worst, it is the position of button. when writing or drawing, I touched the button many times. If you use original samsung s-pen, the button is hidden by way of position alteration. I hope wacom change the button position or body itself.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009PJN1U8" id="B009PJN1U8-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-16:</strong> Look, I'll keep this short. I've purchased a number of these styli for the note 10.1, I use my note for school, work and have now taken to drawing all my pictures and doing nearly all my digital paintings on it as well. I couldn't stand the original S-Pen because it's too small for my large hands and the other wacom friendly pens I had around the house from other devices that share the same type of pen (ASUS EP-121 and a Note II phone) I quickly found that the squirrely screen on the note 10.1 distorted using any of the other pens in certain areas. This is the only one I've purchased that seems to function well on 90% of the tablet's face, and the soft tip doesn't scare me about it scratching like the harder tipped wacom styli I've purchased previously.If you're looking for a stylish stylus that works well with your note tablet I suggest this one highly.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009PJN1U8" id="B009PJN1U8-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-20:</strong> I love this external SPen, it works just like the spen that came with my Galaxy Note.

Granted, I don't engage in a lot of artistic endeavors with it, primarily using it for hand written notes and light sketching.  It's been a dream for me.  The built-in stylus of the Note is just too small for my hands and it felt like a major chore to write with it.  This stylus fits my hand and feels comfortable to write with.  I get great response and accuracy from the tablet and the ability to erase can't be lauded enough.As others have mentioned, the only drawback is that the stylus can't be stored in the tablet like the default one.  If I can find a case that has a slot to place it in, that would be ideal.  Can't really take points off of this stylus for that.  It's more a fault of the design of the tablet/stylus.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009PJN1U8" id="B009PJN1U8-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-28:</strong> This pen is a great improvement over the included s-pen. The longer length is appreciated and it is easier to press the included button. It also comes with pen nibs. They were pretty stuffed down in the box, so make sure you take them out before throwing the box away.I am using with a Galaxy note 8 and it works just fine.I have the settings set to disable pen detection so I can use this larger pen while the included S-pen stays docked within the tablet.One thing to mention, make sure you press down on the eraser part to 'erase'. It took me a while to notice that the eraser functions in Sketchbook Pro were not working for me. This is because the eraser portion of this pen is a button, and you must press down on it to engage the erasing function.The only thing that would make this pen better in my opinion is if it was slightly thicker. But this may be easily cured by buying a pen grip such asThe Pencil Grip, Universal Ergonomic Writing Aid, 6 Count Assorted Colors (TPG-11106), although, it may hinder the pen's button usage.Hope this helps.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009PJN1U8" id="B009PJN1U8-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-07:</strong> I bought the others (like, all of them), and this is my favorite by far.  It's as accurate as the others on both Windows 8 (Lenovo Helix) and Android (Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2, Note 3, and Note).  It has an eraser.OK, it's credibly plastic and small (about 7mm diameter 13cm long), but that's just it.  I won't have a crappy week because I lost a $70 (or even $40) device.  And, frankly, having small (not tiny) hands, this is *exactly* the size I've been wishing pens would be.  I can't believe how manageable this is.It's the perfect mom & student Wacom stylus.

It is great.  Not all apps make use of the eraser side, but that is very nice to have.  It is much easier to hold than those skinny pens inside the Samsung note series.  The quality of detecting touch, etc. is equal to the ones that come with the Samsung note devices.  The casing is plastic.  I was looking for something that looked like a medium/nice pen.  I haven't found anything better yet.  It looks cheap, but it works great.  I just wished it looked as good as it works.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009PJN1U8" id="B009PJN1U8-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-04:</strong> I like it!Very well working and easy to writing.but, I don't know where I have to put this pen.. ;)I tired to hooking my tablet folder but, it's broken ;( well it's my fault.Anyway, this is very good one !</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B009PJN1U8', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B009PJN1U8', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B0044AVKCE</h2>    <p class="price"> $B0044AVKCE</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0044AVKCE" id="B0044AVKCE-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-15:</strong> Good Item for the first week.

However, there are fine differences that make the Sharkk USB Car Charger stand above others.Perhaps the most important is the speed of charging. It averaged 1% per minute, so a device at 80% charge would be fully charged in 20 minutes. Impressive! Also, there are two USB ports, so convenience is a factor in this era of multiple electronic devices. Of course, a person can operate the device while it is charging without much loss of charging speed - at least for an iPhone that I tested.After removing the charger from it's easy-open box, I discovered a textured white plastic band with a square cutout also in the box. The charger itself is all white with a textured black band around most of the section visible when plugged into a vehicle's power port. I realized the white band was an alternative to the black band, which switched out easily.At first, I wasn't sure the purpose of white vs. black. But when I tried out the Sharkk USB Car Charger in my own vehicle, it became obvious. My vehicle's interior is nearly all black.  With the white band on the charger, it really stood out and would be a nice indicator to passers-by that electronic devices were inside. The black band blended the charger into the interior. Very thoughtful  addition.The dual USB ports were flexible, accommodating an Apple Lightning connector and the standard USB charging cord interchangeably. There is an icon with an arrow to the upper port indicating an iDevice. Another icon on the other side points to the lower port for such devices as BlackBerries or Android devices. However, I found no problem using either port for either devices.A -inch square divided into four smaller squares sits within the black or white band's cutout. The squares are a light gray when the charger isn't connected to a power source. When plugged into the vehicle, the squares turn a soft, light blue. Add a USB cable and connect a device, the squares turn a light salmon color. Another thoughtful consideration to let a person know if the charger is indeed making contact with the vehicle and/or with the device.So, there IS a difference in chargers and the Sharkk USB Car Charger with it's solid construction, great price and user-friendly amenities is an excellent choice.Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product to independently test in normal operation situations and provide an impartial review.

The color is a gray/smoke tint which is transparent.  It fits nicely around my iPhone and I've no trouble in placing it into our taking it out of my belt holster.  The sides of the case offer a good gripping surface.  While the back is smooth (and that helps the appearance), I'd prefer a more textured surface.  The buttons for the volume (side) and the power button (top) are rather low profile compared to other cases I've seen.  I'd prefer a higher profile button, but that's just personal preference.  There's ample room on the bottom opening for the charger as well.  Considering the price, this is well worth the money.  I'd recommend you buy one if for no other reason to have a spare if the one you're currently using is rendered useless.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003TMQPC8" id="B003TMQPC8-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-11-09:</strong> Ok,I a little sketchy in buying this cause cause of the other "bad" reviews regarding the Verizon version.However i took my chance and bought it.I am really pleased with this case. Some say that it depends on the seller, that might be true, well at least I can say that "importer520" is working well with his quality, this is my second item from them and its great.The only little detail (mentioned in past reviews too) is the Sound/Mute button. I mean, we all know, (or at least SHOULD know) that the physical diference is due to the antenna placement between one phone and the other, therefore Verizon had to slightly move down the mute button (Closer to the volume) but its like 3mm, nothing impossible to reach.What I did was that I worked those +- 3mm with an X-acto knife (any SHARP and pointed knife can work)but x-acto is very "Exact" and precise.Besides that particular opening, all the rest of them are perfect fit, dock, volume, camera, flash mic-n-speakers too.So here comes my -0.5 star.The headphones cut, is perfect for apple headphones, but I usually connect my iphone with a 3.5mm AUX jack, and it fits VERY tight, (It fits YES, but tight) so it just badges a little. However if you are the type of user who usually DOCKS or uses apple headphones only. You shouldn't have ANY trouble at all.So bottom line is:Great product, great quality.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003TMQPC8" id="B003TMQPC8-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-07:</strong> Spend your money on a better case.

It is made from a hard polymer which I appreciate rather than the rubber stuff. It is slick and easily slips in and out of my pocket. The back looks pretty cool as it isn't just plain. It gives it a nice touch. However the part of the cover where there are major holes (port/speakers and mute/volume buttons) is very weak and I wouldn't trust the cover to actually protect the phone if it fell directly on those places.  Like all of these phones the cover is very easy to pull away however I knew that would happen so it isn't a big deal. The last thing is the standby mode button was almost impossible to push and took a dedicated motion that shouldn't be necessary.  I fixed it by just cutting a hole in the cover and that has fixed the problem. I will be buying a new cover that is a bit more protective but this was a good in-between cover that worked for a a bit until I had time to research a better cover.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003TMQPC8" id="B003TMQPC8-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-07-30:</strong> The product is exactly as I pictured it.

It adds just enough protection for accidental drops with minimal bulk (you may be out of luck if drop it off a balcony on to concrete, but should be OK if you drop it on a tile floor). It is very easy to insert and remove the phone from the case - which is good since I must remove it frequently for my car mount and charging cradle. Still the phone is secure in the case (it won't come off accidentally) and the ports are exposed with enough clearance for the flash and to allow you to insert headphones or the sync cable. The volume and top buttons are covered but the plastic is raised, making them easy to use and identify by touch. The plastic is not any slipperier than the metal band around the edge of the phone, but not tacky so it is easy to slide in or out of the pocket of you skinny jeans (FYI - this is an assumption - I don't actually wear skinny jeans but have had no issues with regular jeans). The only drawback is the screen is completely exposed except for the tiny plastic rim the holds the phone in the case. As I mentioned, it is adequately secure, but the rim rubs up against the edge of some screen protection films and may cause them to bubble and loosen at the edges. Personally, I haven't noticed much difference with wireless reception and overcoming the dreaded 'death-grip'.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003TMQPC8" id="B003TMQPC8-review30" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-05:</strong> i have tried about 20 different cases ranging from hard plastic cases, soft rubber cases, hard rubber cases, plastic and ruber cases but this is by far MY FAVORITE CASE of all time. its a hard rubber case that grips to your jeans when its resting on on your knee or something but when you put it in your pocket, it slides right out unlike those soft rubber cases. it fits perfectly and its easy to get off.it also does what its supposed to almost as well as an otterbox. i have dropped my phone 4ft high onto concrete and my phone is fine. im doubt it cant handle much more than that but that shouldnt be a problem unless youre a window washer or somethingi love this case, i trust this case and this is my favorite case. i use it daily and i will never change.there is only one minor flaw and that is that the lock button is hard to push at first but the more you work it, the easier it gets.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003TMQPC8" id="B003TMQPC8-review31" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-08-08:</strong> Let's face it, if you're buying this case, it's because of the price.

On the back side, there was a little hole with exessive plastic flash around it. This location could have been the "gate", where plastic comes in to the mold tooling forming this case. Just this type of defect would normally sent a product to the scrap bin.The product came directly from Hong Kong in about 6+ weeks.

It fits nicely on my phone and looks much nicer than the price would suggest.  It's just enough to give a little more grip without being too bulky.  There is no interference with any of the ports, camera eye, silent/ringer switch, nor the sleep button.  This case is still slim and slick enough to let you slide your phone into front or rear jean pockets, but it is just grippy enough to prevent the phone from sliding off the couch, bed, etc; a common occurrence for me.I found my naked iPhone4 is so slick on the face and back it sometimes will do a little air hockey action when on a solid surface such as my dining room table.  Basically the phone will slide around on a dry level surface with just a little tap.  Its not like it slides several feet, but just a few inches or more.  After my unattended phone slid off the edge of the table into the tile floor (with no vibrating missed call to rumble the phone over the edge), I realized this phone is sometimes a little too slick for its own good.  Luckily that incident did not damage my phone and now with this case, I shouldn't have a problem with the phone sliding over the table potentially falling off the edge.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003TMQPC8" id="B003TMQPC8-review41" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-03:</strong> Useful little case, I swap between this and a lifeproof case, depending on what I'm doing.

That last point is the price you pay for universal fit.Oh, and did I mention it's also the cheapest solution?</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006N0T674" id="B006N0T674-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-08:</strong> Bought this for my wife's Samsung Galaxy S3 phone.  It fits perfectly and she doesn't have to remove her case either (she has a low profile ACase and not an ugly bulky OtterBox).  While it isn't completely waterproof, it will handle slight rain but that's because her case is also on it.  It attaches very securely to the stem and is easily removeable when necessary.  While this is mounted on a mountain bike, the majority of riding is urban/road.  She hasn't taken this on any rugged trails so the durability for true MTB riding is still questionable, but only a fool would attempt such a thing and expect it to hold up for any considerable amount of time.  I'd much rather wait for some idiot to take their $600 phone on a downhill course with this thing and then rate it 1 star because their phone got smashed...</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006N0T674" id="B006N0T674-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-31:</strong> It isn't the best looking, but it sure does the job.

I was worried that the phone with the shell wouldn't fit, but it slides in perfectly and securely.  I don't feel like there's any chance of it coming out.  The opening on the bottom is nice because it allows sound from music playing on the phone.  I'm using it with Runtastic's Roadbike Pro and love the setup.  My only mod was adding two additional zip ties to the bottom just in case the primary clamp fails.  This is probably overboard, but would rather be safe than sorry, you can't see my additional zip ties anyways.  I looked at dozens of bike cases for my phone, this one's a winner, buy it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006N0T674" id="B006N0T674-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-15:</strong> The outer skin is too reflective especially in bright sunlight.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006N0T674" id="B006N0T674-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-02:</strong> Great fit for my mountain bike</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006N0T674" id="B006N0T674-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-30:</strong> High quality materials.

There are openings at the top and bottom of the phone for power and audio cables and to access the screen off and on button.  How the safety release on the back works is not immediately apparent but it is effective and easy to operate (just slide it up to release and down to engage). Operating the phone through the see-through cover works well. The mounting system is versatile in application and well designed. The connection between the phone and the mounting bracket is solid. Only concern is the openings at the top and bottom allow dust in. A hook and loop strip at these points would seem to be a major improvement.

First, the case is way too big for this phone (4.3" screen).  You will have about 1/2" extra room on each side.  Secondly, and most importantly, it is extremely difficult to slide the unlock bar when your phone goes to "sleep" mode.  There were a few times where I had to stop riding and take the phone out to unlock it.  But to push the icons, it works each time.  So you would have to leave the phone screen on all the time to fix this problem.  The good part about this case is that it does not vibrate and has not fallen off the bike, so far.  For $25, I was very dissappointed.  And I am looking for another one right now.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006N0T674" id="B006N0T674-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-23:</strong> ive been using this case on my mountain bike.  holds up great, definitely the best bike case ive seen so far and is worth every penny.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006N0T674" id="B006N0T674-review19" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-01:</strong> Fits my EVO 4G LTE (4.7&#34; screen) just fine, and the screen is very responsive when in the case.

I took the risk and bought it anyway.  And I'm glad I did.  My monstrous phone (while very snug) does fit in this case.My understanding is the more recent version of the Note - the Galaxy Note 2 - is slightly narrower but also slightly taller.  So while the Note 2 should also fit, it may stick out a little more at the top; getting the headset to plug in (and close the velcro strap) may be a bit difficult.My only complaint is that the clear plastic casing does make it more difficult to see the screen as it will adhere to certain parts of the screen but not others.  It makes for an inconsistent display.  However, it does offer some protection from sweat and rain and obviously secures the phone better than clamp-style mounts.  It's also surprisingly responsive to touch - almost as good as if the plastic wasn't there.The case is very sturdy and can handle significant bumps and potholes even with this gigantic phone squeezed in it.

After reading the reviews, it seemed like a good case. I love the idea of being able to pop out the stand from the case and quickly set it up for viewing. What I received did not match the images above.In the photo, there is a flip-out stand built into the case. The one I received has a space for the BlackBerry logo to show through, instead of the stand. They added a wire to the holster so that the holster clip could be used as a stand instead. It works okay as a stand, but it means you have to take the clip off of your belt to use it every time. My whole point of ordering this case was to use it without the holster.The case installed easily on the phone. It just snaps onto the device quite easily. It also comes off just as easy. When put into the case with the phone facing inwards, it is loose-fitting. I don't think it will fall out, but it isn't snug at all. There are three overlapping tabs to hold the phone into the holster (left, right, and bottom) that will keep it from falling out, but it does wiggle around when inserted.When turned around (screen facing outward), it fits in the holster very snug. I'm guess the looseness the other way around was so that it will fit facing outward as well. The overlapping tabs do reach over the screen edges a bit, so if you are watching a video while using the holster as a stand, they will protrude slightly. They probably won't interfere with watching something on the phone much.I deducted a star for the item not matching the photo, and another for the loose fit. It will probably do a decent job of protecting the phone, and can be used as a stand (using the holster). It's not what I expected, and am still figuring out if I am going to keep it or return it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BZ02XS6" id="B00BZ02XS6-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-25:</strong> Easy on and easy off.

It is exactly like the Pure Gear holster I have, but it is much cheaper.  Here is a picture of how both holsters look.B00BEY0T66This is a great case, stand and holster combo.  The case that surrounds the Blackberry slightly protrudes past the screen, which protects it from falls without taking away from the screen real estate.  The grip on the case prevents the Blackberry from slipping out of your hand.  There is a piece in the back case that slides out to allow the Blackberry to stand on its side.  It takes a little effort to slide the case into the holster.  When the case is in the holster, the Blackberry will not slide out.  The rotating holster prevents the belt clip from breaking.

MP3s can also be used as ringtones. all-in-all, no complaints here! well, except the 256MB limit.radio: nice little feature! you HAVE to have the headset plugged in to listen to the radio, as it acts as the antenna, but while it's plugged in, you can send the sound to come out of the speakers. radio is easy to use, channels are easy to store and radio sounds good. the radio (as well as the MP3 player), will pause if you get a call and resume when you're done. you can also use the radio and MP3 player while doing other things on the phone. headphones sound awesome.games: the phone came with six games: asphalt3D, blockbreaker, bruwnswick billiards, jewel quest, name that tune, tetris, and 3D extreme air snowboarding. all games are locked, so you can only play them for about a minute and then you are prompted to purchase them. they are $6-$8, roughly. total rip off. thanks cingular.ringtones: again, thanks to cingular, there are only six ringtones that come with this phone, and they are pretty crappy. there are free ones all over the place, so don't go spending your inheritance on buying them from cingular. or, do as i do and grab them off another SE phone via bluetooth. there is a little app including on the phone called musicDJ and you can actually make your own ringtones. kinda cool. i've made a few so far and they aren't bad. well, ok, my mom said they sounded horrible, but what does she know?syncing: this phone syncs with your contacts, tasks, notes and calendar, if you have those kinds of programs on your PC. i got my phone to sync with my outlook, which now means i'll sell my PDA. SE's PC suite works pretty well and transferring files is easy. however, it seems like every now and again, when i am connected via USB, it reboots my phone. don't know what that's about. i don't think any harm is being done.the phone feels pretty solid in your hand, weight-wise. i've never owned a slider/swivel phone in my life, and while it's not the most convenient to "flip" open, it's not bad. you can actually place and receive calls with the phone swivelled shut, too, which i liked.it seems like SE didn't leave anything out with this phone (except a memory slot) and i love it. they thought of everything on this phone: radio, little flash light, dedicated key lock button, infrared, calendar, music/video/picture DJ,stopwatch, timer, tasks, notes and the list goes on and on. the phone's styling (ie: orange cover) isn't for everyone, but i love it. my phone did come with a 2nd cover, in navy blue. it's styling and shape is great and i love the orange backlit keypad. it's definitely a head-turner.and, above all, reception and clarity of calls is great. i've had no complaints when i've used the phone, the headset, the bluetooth headset and speakerphone. it's really nice. this of course, can be dependent on your network. i live in the midwest in a fairly large area (260K people), so we have cell towers all over the place.pros:* nice size.* bluetooth, infrared and speakerphone.* radio and MP3s* clarity of calls is excellent. reception is great.* screen is nice and bright.* easy to get pics, vids, etc. on and off the phone.* phone comes with everything you need (except car charger)* this phone is loaded - nothing is left out!* sony ericsson's interface is great; apps like the address book are loaded with room for tons of info. menus are easy to use.cons:* no memory slot. on-board memory, while not bad, is limited to 256MB.* price (well, at full retail anyway).* camera is disappointing for a 1.3MP.* phone goes into standby (screen off) after 15 seconds. very annoying and to date, i've found no way to change that.* games are locked for only 1 minute of play. thanks cingular ;( not ONE free game is included.* keypad buttons are small, and close together. i have small hands, so the key size is not so bad, it's the fact that they are right next to each other.this is a great phone. its big disappointment is the fixed 256MB memory, but for a lot of people who just want to listen to a few songs and not 500, this phone will suit you just fine. i am hoping to keep this phone for more than six months (which is about how often i get a new cell phone) - it has everything i need and nothing i don't. kudos to sony ericsson for putting out a great phone! woo! ;)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B000C1CHVC" id="B000C1CHVC-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2005-12-22:</strong> I did a lot of research on phones before finally settling on the W600i phone. I really didn't need an MP3 player as I usually carry a PDA with me as well, but the features on this phone were just too good to pass up. I considered a Motorola RAZR but saw a lot of complaints about battery life. Well, no problems here! I've previously been using a SE T616 which had superb battery life, and this phone is equally as good. Which is certainly important if you do plan to use it as a music player.First things first...entering phone numbers. So tedious on most phones, and something I always dread. Thankfully, the W600i came with software to sync with Outlook. It took me a little while to figure out the syncing software. When you hook the phone up to USB, it can go into phone mode or file mode and for some reason the software always tells me it can't find the phone if it is in file mode. So to sync, I had to put it in phone mode. Turns out file mode was used only for transferring MP3s. Still tells me it can't find the phone, yet the transfer did work! Sometimes when I plug it in, my computer won't see it without rebooting, which cost me a lot of time and aggravation trying to figure out as well. So somewhat annoying implementation here, but such a time saver, and something I've never had before at all with a phone, so it's hard to gripe. I usually don't bother to put appointments and tasks on my cell phone, but since they just sync with Outlook, now that's easy to do as well. This may not be a SmartPhone, but it could replace a PDA for casual users.The MP3 player is decent enough. Sound quality was much better than I expected. Then I tried the built-in FM radio. Wow, awesome reception here! The cord acts as an antennae so you have to be sure to unwind it for best results, but considering how far from the stations I am, I was quite impressed with how nice it sounded. Some simple equalizer settings, nothing special. Only gripe would be the lack of an external memory card, there's certainly room for one so it should have been added. I guess Sony's proprietary Memory Stick would be large to squeeze in, so rather than add a SD slot, they just left it out completely. Booo to that.Phone data features worked great. I got even better reception on the W600i than my T616 and now also have Edge. Had no problems using Bluetooth to connect up to my PDA and laptop, and speeds were pretty nice. The Media Net services worked fast and there were some nice demo services included as well. Not sure I will pay for these but definitely worth considering.Camera is better than most cell phone cameras I have used, but still nothing great. The pseudo-flash is at least an attempt to improve indoor shots but any real camera still beats the pants off it. You can even use the little flash-light as an SOS beacon if you get lost. ;-) Even better is the image import included with the PC software. Was nice to easily copy over GOOD photos to use for my contacts.To use the keypad, you have to swivel the back of the camera down. It makes a cool little sound and lights up, but it's not the easiest motion to do one-handed and will also make getting a decent playthrough case a lot harder than other phones. The buttons are easy to press though, an improvement over my old T616. There are also a couple buttons at the top of the screen that confused me as to their function (of course, I don't bother with manuals!) I did figure out that they were used when playing games in landscape mode. Neat idea. There were a couple bugs in the OS as well. When using voice dial, an misrecognized command results in a really weird and annoying sound coming from the phone. And the voice command symbols in the address book are very buggy...appearing and disappearing from the contacts that don't have them. Hopefully a phone firmware upgrade will fix these.This is the first cell phone I've had with a real speakerphone. You really can use it without having to hold it up to your ear...assuming you are someplace it won't disturb other users. You can play music through the speaker as well, and use those MP3s as alarms and phone sounds, so lots of things to play with here. For some reason a lot of the phone tones you can buy through Cingular are not available for this phone yet, but hopefully they will get those working soon. I also had trouble downloading a couple games I purchased.Some users have reported issues with using bluetooth headsets, particularly with voice control. I'm not a fan of having another device I have to charge all the time, so I prefer using a regular handfree. And this phone actually comes with one for free! The headphones double as a handsfree headset in addition to the FM antennae, so it's well worth carrying and using over a bluetooth headset, IMO.I was able to get both my PDA and my laptop to pair up with it and use it as a modem for internet connection, although my laptop was a bit flaky and did require a bluetooth upgrade and reboot to get it working. Great speed difference with the Edge network! According to Windows, I was getting 400Kbps, with my old phone it was usually around 100Kbps. The phone has a nice "E" symbol that tells you when you are on Edge, and "G" for regular GPRS. Even in my house out here in the country I am able to get Edge, which was a pleasant surprise. I haven't traveled much yet, but it looks like they already have pretty good coverage, and metro areas in particular shouldn't be an issue.So, this may not be the smallest, lightest phone out there. There are definitely some issues like the weird swivel design, voice dial bugs and lack of memory card support that may be cause for complaint. But if your priorities are a phone with great battery life, excellent reception, Edge and bluetooth, and easy to use, this one should definitely be at the top of your list. If you don't already have  a portable MP3/FM player, I don't see how you could even consider anything else! I've yet to find the perfect phone, but this one comes so close to it and is so much better than the other phones I've had, I have to give it 5 stars.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B000C1CHVC" id="B000C1CHVC-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2006-06-03:</strong> First, the White Screen of Death Issue.  I had 3 units til instead of returning tp Cingular.  I sent it back to SONY.  NO more problems.  They flashed it with the latest firmware and it works fine.  The WOD will seem to occur after you disconnect after a file transfer.  However, wait 20 seconds and the phone reboots.Pro: Loud and easy to hear from.Con:  Buttons and keypad is hard to get use to.Pro:  The camera is fine for a phone cam.Con: Battery drain is bad, when you play the MP3 player.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B000C1CHVC" id="B000C1CHVC-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2006-02-24:</strong> This phone has grown on me.  At first I wasn't sure I needed all this stuff, it felt a bit heavy, I was unsure of the swivel design, and I felt guilty for buying such an expensive phone.  But now I know I'd buy it again.  It's still a little heavy (compared to the Razr, which was my other choice) but the reception is great, it has lots of functions, and the interface is easy to navigate.  Best of all, the speaker phone function is one of the best I've ever heard.

The Legend headset was costly enough as it is.Ok, so my fault for not realizing this before I purchased the headset, I assumed the headset would be compatible with the average charger. There are so many electronic gadgets, adapters, chargers etc ... filling up drawers, boxes and the like all over the country that Plantronics should be more environmentally friendly and do what everyone else is supposedly doing and make their chargers universal.

But it is not so easy to quickly replace on the spot if you misplace or lose it, as happened to me. On-the-street replacements from some retailers can be costly.ThePlantronics Voyager Legend Charge Cableis a good one, and the new magnetic snap-fit connector has proven to be a good one when attached to thePlantronics Voyager Legend Bluetooth Headset. The connector works well in that if someone bumps or jerks the cord, the headset will pop off of the socket safely, without damaging the connector or headset. It's reminiscent of the MagSafe power connector that is found on the MacBook Pro, which keeps keeps that computer from crashing to the floor is someone trips over the power cord.The shortcoming with this cord is that it's only 9-inches long, though that's not an issue for many. The price is OK for a proprietary cord that works, but there is a far better choice for Voyager Legend owners. ThePlantronics Voyager Legend microUSB Charge Adapteris a far better buy than than the original replacement, as it includes a 24-inch USB to micro-USB charge cable that plugs into the magnetic snap-fit connector. The product images show that it has a short tether, which allows the connector to be attached to the cable so that it doesn't get lost.I had lost my original charges cable when visiting a client site, and was surprised that many retailers did not carry this cable as a replacement. When I finally did locate one locally at a major cell phone store, it was at a substantially higher price. Lesson learned, the hard way.Compare both the price and specs between the replacement Voyager Legend Charge Cable here and the more versatilePlantronics Voyager Legend microUSB Charge Adapter. At the time of this review, this multi-function adapter only costs $3.00 more than the original replacement, so there are better choices available.6/10/2013</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009UNH0EM" id="B009UNH0EM-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-04:</strong> Lost my cable and to my surprise, it was less expensive here than direct from the manufacturer.

This is not the case with the Energen. It fits very well on the iPhone &#8211; secure, tight fit but without any port access problems. While the case does make the phone fatter (as expected) it still looks pretty sleek. It also has a kickstand feature that allows the phone to be propped up for viewing, which is a helpful addition.The battery gives a capacity of 2400mAh which the manufacturer claims will double the battery life. That&#8217;s pretty accurate. I like that it has a &#8220;gas gauge&#8221; charge indicator (4 LED lights) that give a quick read on how much power is left.I find it to be a great alternative to using an external powerbank since the case is a lot easier to take along and doesn&#8217;t add much bulk to the phone. Well worth considering if you&#8217;re looking for an easy way to add extra battery life.[Sample provided for review]</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HX0QDEW" id="B00HX0QDEW-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-14:</strong> ...but hey, if i can get protection and double my battery, it's totally worth it right?Pros:Looks solidly built.Kick stand is nice to haveCase appears as if it will charge from any micro usbFront facing speakers makes accidentally covering the speakers more difficultCons:Phone is totally dependent on the proprietary micro usb cable that comes with the casePhone doesn't actually charge through the case unless its via the included cable.Phone won't sync with itunes through the case with any micro usb cableCase will break apart into its individual pieces after a drop on the kitchen floor from standing height.Microphone jack will be more difficult to access, although an extension is includedCase will add weight and bulk, but is not unacceptable. Feels a little bit like a handheld console instead of an iphone.Conclusions:I've only used it for about 24 hours, and my phone is still alive and well after a tumble on the kitchen floor. Perhaps the case is a bit slick on the back, and its bulkiness will make the grip a little more difficult, but overall, it is an ok caseEDIT - After a another 2 weeks of off and on use I have some additional comments.Apple's OEM headphones will fit through the headphone port with the case, but it will be much further in. It makes me worry that I may break my earbuds since I need to pull from the soft part of the wire encasing to remove them. Otherwise, I'm happy this works out ok.The case is pretty easy to disassemble compared to a lot of the silicone sleeve cases.There's not much of a lip. The screen will touch the surface with my screen protector on, so the lip is approximately equal to the thickness of a tempered glass screen protector.I noticed the power button and volumn/mute keys are a bit more difficult to get to as well since the original 5s buttons are pretty shallow. I obsess over turning my screen off at every chance (even though I have an extended battery which makes this power save negligible), so this can be of a minor annoyance.I don't use this as a full-time case, but do use it if I feel like it's going to be a long day. I'd probably bump it up to 3.5 stars if I could.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HX0QDEW" id="B00HX0QDEW-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-03:</strong> Besides giving you almost a full extra charge, this case will provide a simple protection for a gently used phone.  This is not the case to use in rugged situations, but it is very nice looking and will help to keep your phone safe from normal daily wear and tear.  (While I was writing my review, one of our cats took a stroll over my desk and knocked my phone to the floor.  The case came apart after it hit the ground, but the case protected the phone from damage.The case is well-made of hard plastic.  I especially like the fact that it came with two different translucent colored frames, one of them clear.  I have a black phone, and usually stick with black cases, but I chose differently this time:  The matte-finish, silvery-white back with the clear frame gives my phone a totally different look.  I like what the blue frame does to the look of my phone, too.The USB cable is heavy-duty and the plug ends are molded around the metal male tabs.  I've had cheap USB cables that pulled apart--either at the cord or at the metal tongue, but I don't see that happening with this cable.  It also comes with a durable pass-through audio jack cable.Take a close-up look at a bottom-front of the case.  See where the sound comes out?  The series of holes is a different from single large holes in the uNu case I have.  This works quite well for moving sound.The case also offers protection from over-charging and short circuits.  That is a safety feature and a big plus.The four-light LED charge indicator and a kick-stand is located on the back along with the power button.  The kick-stand clicks closed and the power button is a bit recessed:  The features work to prevent accidentally powering on/off or breaking off the stand.*I received a sample product from Energen.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HX0QDEW" id="B00HX0QDEW-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-01:</strong> The Energen rechargeable case for the iPhone5/5S is a well thought out product that is easy to use and very useful. The case doesn't add to much additional size to the iPhone. Compared to the ultra slim Saturn case I normally have on the iPhone, the Energen adds 1/2&#34; to the length and 3/16&#34; to the depth. Functionally, it provides almost a full charge to the iPhone. The battery case comes with a USB cable for charging and a headphone extension cable. The extension cable is necessary for any headphone plugs larger in diameter than the headphones that come with the iPhone 5/5S. If you normally use the headphones that come with the iPhone 5/5S, they will connect to the headphone jack without the extension cable.INSTALLING & USING THE BATTERY CASE:The battery case consists of 2 pieces; the back (battery) and frame. Simply slide the iPhone down the back so it connects to the battery case using the lighting plug. After that, snap the outer frame into place. The frame holds everything together and protects the sides of the iPhone. The iPhone feels very secure inside the case and the case feels like it can take some abuse. On the back of the battery case is the power button. Hold it down for 3 seconds to turn the battery case on and begin charging the iPhone. There are 4 LED indicator lights on the back so you know how much power is left in the battery case. With the iPhone in the case you can charge both the case and iPhone at the same time using the USB cable supplied with the battery case.IPHONE CHARGING TEST:On a full charge of the battery case, it provided almost a full charge of an iPhone 5S. The Energen charged the iPhone 5S from 17%-98% before it completely ran out of juice. Given that the battery case's capacity is 2400mAh this is about how much of a charge I expected. While charging the iPhone, it did so at a rate of 1% per minute up until 80% when the charging rate slowed which is all completely normal for a 1A charger.ENERGEN CHARGING TEST:With the Energen's battery completely depleted I fully charge it without an iPhone in the case. It took nearly 3 hours and 30 minutes to completely charge the battery case. While it may seem like a long time since it typically takes 2 hours and 30 minutes to fully charge an iPhone from a nearly dead battery, every external battery I've tested takes longer.When charging the Energen and iPhone together, charging of the iPhone automatically shuts off when the iPhone reaches 100%. When this happens a small window pops up on the iPhone which says, &#34;Accessory not supported.&#34; Just click &#34;OK&#34; and the Energen continues to charge while the iPhone runs off its own battery. When the 4 LED indicators on the back of the battery case light solid, the Energen is done charging.PROS:1. Easy to use & functions how you think it should.2. Supports charging of both battery case & iPhone at the same time.3. Provides almost 1 full charge of iPhone 5S.4. iPhone feels secure in the case & the case feels like it can take some abuse.5. Compared to an iPhone in an ultra slim case, the Energen doesn't add too much additional size.6. Case has a built-in kickstand on its back so you can prop the phone up on its side.7. Comes with headphone extension cable so you can still use whatever headphones you normally use with the iPhone.8. User manual is very well done. It is easy to understand and has illustrations.CONS:1. The iPhone's built-in speakers sound a little muffled with the case on.2. Takes almost 3 hours and 30 minutes to fully charge battery case if the battery is completely depleted.SUMMARY:The Energen is a well designed battery case. If you use an iPhone heavily on a daily basis this is good product to have. Functionally, I like this battery case better than external battery chargers. With external battery chargers you need to carry around your iPhone, the external battery, and a charging cable. With the battery case all you carry around is your iPhone and the case almost doubles the battery life of your phone. If looking for a portable charging solution to your iPhone 5/5S I recommend the Energen battery case.Note: A product sample was provided by the seller in exchange for a fair, unbiased review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HX0QDEW" id="B00HX0QDEW-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-05:</strong> First and foremost, I really like the way this case looks.  I love that you have a choice of colors and that it's not just a piece of black plastic (of course, they have that option too if you want it but for me, the look is very important too).This is also a case that feels very sturdy.  You know how you buy some cases and they are so light you know it's going to crack the minute you drop the phone?  This does not feel like that.  It is strong and sturdy.As to functionality, it does exactly what it says.  It protects your phone and doubles the life of your battery.  You simply slide your phone in the protector, plug it into an outlet with the cord thats provided and voila.  Your phone charges and your protector charges. So if your phone runs out of battery, the protector kicks in and you can keep using your phone.The protector also has a kickstand which you can use to hold your phone up horizontally.  Although it works fine, the kickstand doesn't feel very sturdy.  I never use a kickstand and don't really see a need for it so it makes zero difference to me whether it's sturdy or not.All in all, I definitely recommend this product.I received a sample for review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HX0QDEW" id="B00HX0QDEW-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-07:</strong> This case has several benefits. It dramatically increases iphone 5/5s battery. I tried with a iphone 5. With the mobile phones we are always draining our batteries with so many useful (and not so useful) apps. I use navigation/music/podcasts as top apps. At the end of day I am left with 10-20% battery left if I am lucky. This energen battery comes in handy at these times!It was so easy to put. One big thing to note is it uses the lighting port to hook up and we have a microUSB for charging and syning up the ipohne. This is cool. Please be aware if you are using lot of accessories that need lighting connector, you have to remove the case before using them. I don't and this fits perfectly. All the buttons are accessible, for the audio portion you need the provided extension cable. Was able to charge, look at LEDs on back and worked exactly as said. Overall I like the protection it provides as well as the great utility from extensible battery.I was provided a sample, but this is my honest and fair review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00HX0QDEW', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00HX0QDEW', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B009TDBR74</h2>    <p class="price"> $B009TDBR74</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009TDBR74" id="B009TDBR74-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-20:</strong> It's not the best but it is ok for the most part...........................I will probably not purchase more!

I have the green iPhone 5c and the match was perfect and I am very picky about things like that! The fit is great and it was simple to put the soft solid green silicone layer on the phone and position and snap the hard plastic pieces (front and back) together as a top coat of sorts. I purchased my iPhone when they first came out in the fall and as far as case selection the choices were slim. Because of that I have ended up buying about 10 cases in the past six months that I hardly use. The biggest problems were that many manufacturers used THEIR interpretation of green instead of getting the actual phone and matching the best they could. Also the term &#34;rubberized&#34; that is used on many cases consist of hard plastic with a matte type finish for better grip. They say these hard plastic covers alone are impact resistant but I don't want to put an expensive phone such as this to test that claim other hybrid covers like this that I found had a boring solid color which became boring after a few days. I have found that &#34;Hybrid&#34; covers like this give what I feel is the best protection for your phone. There is the soft spongy silicone layer that you place directly on your phone and the hard plastic cover snaps over on top. I feel that the 2 covers provide the best protection. I love the Tribal design with the green matching the green phone perfectly and the complementary colors give the phone a great look and I paid at least double for the plain hybrids I bought before Amazon led me to these covers. There was a really nice surprise that I didn't realize until I put the outer cover on. On the other cases I have purchased the top snap on front piece had only a very thin frame around the screen and using this cover there is a VERY stylish substantial frame that shows the design in more detail on the front and not only the back. Finally I did touch on this earlier but it warrants a repeat......the PRICE is terrific and the shipping is both fast and free.i did read a review when I was purchasing this cover where they talked about the silicone soft spongy inner layer was shifting around and had to be repositioned frequently. I have checked this out with my cover and I really can't see this happening WHEN BOTH LAYERS are used together. I would never put words in another reviewers review but the only way I could see a potential problem was if the silicone was used alone.I have just received this case so if there is anything that I notice PRO OR CON I will add the info to my review.  So my present evaluation is that this case is beautiful and it I'll definitely show off what a pretty color the green iPhone 5c is</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00G4S9FYY" id="B00G4S9FYY-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-06:</strong> Not so much protection for a huge fall but perfect for and scuffs or scrapes</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00G4S9FYY" id="B00G4S9FYY-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-01:</strong> This case broke the first time that I dropped my phone, so much for high impact.

I have sent to Seidio to get it replaced.  Protection-wise, it is great. I have had numerous incidents dropping it and it wasn't phased whereas I had another Body Glove case which was seemingly good as well until my daughter dropped the phone and cracked the screen a few weeks after I got the phone.  The design is there. Maybe a material improvement would fix this challenge.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003PJ6QV0" id="B003PJ6QV0-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-07-10:</strong> I was going to save a few bucks and get a cheaper case, but I'm glad I didn't.  This is an awesome case.  So when it came I was surprised that is was two pieces.  Ok, I thought, it has a belt clip or something.  No, that's not it.  One piece is a soft form fitting rubber shell that comes up sufficiently over the front of the phone to protect it, but not cover the screen.  I was worried that the HTC EVO power button would be a challenge for any case, but it works with this case.  The cutouts are a perfect fit for the phone, and don't impede any of the functions...camera, stand, speaker, flash etc.  The second piece is a semi-hard plastic shell that fits perfectly into cutouts in the back of the case.  This piece acts as a clamp to keep the soft rubber shell securely in place.  Really cool design, and the hard plastic piece doesn't add any thickness over what the soft rubber case provides.  The thickness of the case does protect the glass camera, but that was what I expected.  The hard plastic also provides the benefit of making it easier to get out of my pocket, as the soft rubber would surely grab onto clothes...overall, the thickness is good for me...not too thick.Anyway, I highly recommend this case.  Don't know if a case could be better designed for this phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003PJ6QV0" id="B003PJ6QV0-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-07-16:</strong> I am very happy with this case.  It fits well and I feel like my phone has some protection.  I can lay it face down and it protects the screen.  I can lay it on it's back and it protects the camera. It has a nice feel to it and I like the finger indents on the sides.  The only problem I have had is trying to find a carrying case to fit it.  I normally use a horizontal leather pouch, but I haven't been able to find one big enough for the cased phone.  I decided to try the new Seidio clip for the active case (have always been afraid of the clips), and I must say I am happy with it so far.  It seems to be pretty secure.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003PJ6QV0" id="B003PJ6QV0-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-09-05:</strong> May be a little pricey as it was to me but it is definitely worth it.

I had previously purchased (and reviewed) theAmzer Silicone Skin Jelly Case for HTC EVO 4G (Black), and was hoping that the Innocase would be the last case purchase I would make for my new phone.  This case appeared to offer substantial protection with a form-fitting design.  I was drawn to the fact that this case has a plastic exo-skeleton which helped keep the rubber surround snug on the phone.  Early reviews for the case were also extremely favorable, with many users reporting things like a "fit like a glove".Six months of use has given me a good perspective on what this case does well.  I'm not sure if I have butter fingers or what, but I swear I drop my phone at least weekly.  This means that I have probably dropped my phone from decent heights 25 times or more in this case.  I am happy to report that my phone is no worse for the wear despite this relatively rough handling, and has nary a scratch on it.  The case is indeed snug because of the exo-skeleton and does a great job keeping dust and other grime away from my phone.I do have a few gripes with this case.  I first off do not like the added bulk that this case adds to my phone.  This added bulk combined with the larger surface area of rubber causes the phone to "stick" somewhat when I put it in or pull it out of my pocket.  "Stick" isn't really the right word, but that extra amount of rubber does create a sense of friction when pocketing my phone.  If this was the only drawback to this case, I would wholeheartedly recommend it simply because of the superior protection it provides.  Unfortunately, I have also noticed diminished reception with this case.I work in an area that has "fair" phone coverage according to Sprint's phone map.  On my phone, this translates to three out of six bars of coverage.  Shortly after putting the case on my phone, I noticed that my phone began dropping calls at work.  I called Sprint several times in an attempt to troubleshoot my phone, and nothing seemed to help.  I didn't even suspect that my new case was the culprit, so I just learned to live with the new worse coverage.  One day at work I went to swap out my battery with a backup I had purchased (one of the major drawbacks of one or no bar coverage is the fact that your phone switches to roaming a lot and eats your battery), and I noticed that after swapping the battery and setting the phone on my desk that the reception had improved back to three bars.  I further noticed that upon putting the case back on my reception dropped back down to one or no bars.Somewhat incredulously I repeated this exercise many times over the next few weeks.  Furthermore, I used the Speedtest app available in the app store to take 3G internet speed tests during random times of the day.  By simply removing this case, I averaged speed test increases of almost 150 kbps over those several weeks.  It became clear that the case had a definitive and repeatable negative effect on my phone's voice and internet reception.Because of these faults, I cannot recommend this product.  I bought the HTC Evo to be able to use it, and this case effectively renders usage difficult at best in areas with less-than-stellar coverage.  I have since gone back to using the Amzer case referenced above.  While the Amzer case may have issues with dust, it provides decent protection without negative reception effects.  If you are considering purchasing this case, I would strongly recommend that you pay attention to your reception levels throughout your day.  If you see three or less bars of coverage in an area that you frequent, this case is probably not the best choice.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003PJ6QV0" id="B003PJ6QV0-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-10-31:</strong> I purchased this case in July.  After 3-4 months of daily usage, the case is just about finished.  I have dropped the phone once onto pavement - the case served its purpose and protected my phone.  Except that the corner of the exoskeleton that hit the ground completely snapped off.  A few days later while using my phone another corner broke off - I wasn't doing anything out of the ordinary with it then.  Like other reviewers here I am also experiencing the rubberized coating "peeling" off - this doesn't affect functionality but it impact the nice look of the case.My last remark is that inside the exoskeleton there is a small square imprinted on the plastic.  This square has rubbed through the rubberized inner case and left a square mark on the back of my phone.  This definitely degrades from the prestineness of my phone's shell and case and is definitely an issue since this is supposed to PROTECT my phone, not damage it.Overall the case has a great feel and should protect your phone if you drop it, but be prepared to submit an RMA to Seidio to get a new exoskeleton every few months - if that will even work.  For the price I would look at other options - maybe Seidio's newer cases are better, I'm not sure.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003PJ6QV0" id="B003PJ6QV0-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-08-18:</strong> Pros:-Solid construction and innovative design-Very good fit and feel on the device-Very rugged.

It lasted for a few months but after taking off the "skeleton"piece to change the battery, the bottom two "tags" broke off.  it is cheaply made plastic that will wear out after a while.  The case is still being used, but I am purchasing the Ballistic case for a heavy duty fit.  I work out and I use my phone in my pocket.  I also use it when cutting the grass.  This obviously did not hold up very well.  I tried to get a replacement but Seidio said it was "past the 180 day warranty".  The website says 1 year.

They first started as a company that designed unique and quality products for PDAs, which slowly evolved into Smartphones. They has a passion for innovation and this lead them to become the leading manufacturer of Smartphone accessories.They are also very well known for their rubberized cases. Many online forums and review sites have reviewed and vouch for their products. Their products are known to be built for quality and endurance.Currently they are carrying a variety of cases for the Sprint HTC Evo 4G, Ultimate Screen Guard Protectors, Spare Batteries, Chargers, Cables, and many more. You can visit their site here for all the details and see a list of their products (Seidio - Your Single Source for Premium Smartphone Accessories).Build QualityThe build quality of this case is pretty different compared to the Innocase II that everyone is accustom to. It isn't hard plastic. Instead, it is made from soft silicon and plastic. The case is still two piece like most Seidio products (main piece is silicon, the second piece is a clip on of thin hard plastic that holds the phone and the case tightly around all edges). It also has the rubberized feel that everyone is used to.Upon putting on the case, I held the case in my hand without the phone in it for couple seconds. The texture is definitely nice. It's not like any of those cheap silicon cases that you can get for couple bucks on ebay. It's build to perfection.I loved how they put curvature on the case for where your fingers are. it gives you a sense of security when your holding the phone.Fitment:WOW! Fits perfect. When i mean by fit's perfect, it means that there isn't any space on the inside. It's almost like putting the phone into a high end pair of socks. It fits tight and smooth. Since the case is silicon, you don't have to worry much about the case on the inside. There's no sliding of individual pieces to put the case on, therefore you don't have to worry about scratching the phone.Seidio also once again did a perfect job when it comes to cutout on the backing and the back cover of the phone. The camera, speaker, and LED are all cut to perfection. Nothing is blocked in anyway. Also you don't have to worry about anything touching the camera lens. Kickstand is also the same. The bottom of the phone also gives easy access to the HDMI and the mini USB port.One thing that I feel weird about is the power button and the volume rocker being covered by silicon. Basically your pressing on the case to access those three buttons. BUT! they did give some embossing for those buttons so you can easily find them with your fingers without looking at the buttons.Protection:There's no possible way to scratching the inside of the casing when you have the phone on the inside. The silicon does a perfect job at this.All edges are protected with silicon and a piece of hard plastic. Silicon is also known to give better protection when the phone drops on the floor. The silicon gives less impact on the phone when dropped.Oh, of course, be sure to use a screen protector.Conclusion:In conclusion, the case lives up to the standard of innovation. They really did make a case that protected the phone real well. The design is slick and they gave a little more design than the standard hard plastic Innocase II. This case gives the phone more of a sports looks, almost like another one of those Marware cases that were made for the iPhone (but the quality of Seidio is much better than Marware).The case is cheaper than the Innocase II. You can buy this Seidio Innocase Active Limited Edition Case from Amazon. They are selling this case for Seidio exclusively. The price is cheaper, but the quality is top of the line. If you love silicon, get this case. If you like hard plastic, get Seidio Innocase II.I do wish that they did something different for this case. I would like to see some other designs and colors. It would be nice to see 2 tone colors (Silicon to be one color and the hard plastic clip on to be another color. This would give it some contrast. (this is personal opinion).Comparison to Innocase II:Size of Active Limited Edition is probably half a millimeter thicker all around. Yes it is a bit bulkier. Both cases are totally different feel. Like I said before, if you like hard case (Seidio Innocase II), if you like Silicon (Active Limited Edition). It would be a hard comparison, but I do like the silicon one better. The only reason is because the inside is more protected. I dont' have to worry about the sliding of hard plastic causing scratches on the bezel of the phone.oh, Innocase Holster doesn't work with this Active Limited Case. This is a big downer. I can't use the holder anymore!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003PJ6QV0" id="B003PJ6QV0-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-06-28:</strong> I purchased this prior to going on vacation.  The case feels very durable, and should allow your phone to survive drops with little issue.  I haven't dropped my phone yet, so I can't verify, but it does keep the phone from touching anything.  The case also sticks out a little farther than the camera lense, so that is now protected from scratches.  Doesn't interfere with headphone usage, or charger plug ins.  It doesn't make the phone feel bulky (no more than usual).  Also, the outer skeleton doesn't make the silicone grip everything in your pocket when you pull the phone out.  The case does have an odor when you first get it, but it's not quite as bad as the other reviewer mentioned.  It goes away after a few days of usage.  The color does not fade onto your clothing, even if you are sweating.  I'd definitely recommend this case to anyone looking to protect their Evo.The only complaint I have, which is why I gave it 4 stars, is you really have to push down on the power button to turn on the device.  I don't know if it's because the knob for the power button isn't in the right place, or not, but I had to adjust how I turned on the device after getting the case.  Now I have no issues.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B003PJ6QV0', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B003PJ6QV0', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00DLCQTHW</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00DLCQTHW</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DLCQTHW" id="B00DLCQTHW-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-23:</strong> This is not working all the time with my iPhone 5, sometimes I get the message saying this accessory can not be used</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DLCQTHW" id="B00DLCQTHW-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-07:</strong> This car charger looks sturdy but more times than not, it doesnt connect with my phone and charge it.

The positives:1) It's a stylish, good looking product with a weather-resistant case.2) It connects four different ways: 2 wirelessly (bluetooth and NFC) and 2 wired (3.5mm jack and USB).  I can tell you that the Bluetooth connection to my table and to my phone was a breeze.  And it comes with an audio cable that conveniently stores in the base of the unit.3) All the controls are easily accessible.  Play and volume controls on the top and on/off and ports on the side.  The side ports include the 3.5mm jack, USB and (bonus) a phone charging port.  There's also a convenient handle on the side opposite to the ports.4) You can use these speakers as a speakerphone.5) The sound quality is excellent, much better than I'd expected in sound quality and volume!6) It's rechargeable and the charge lasts a long time.  And (another bonus) there's an audio indicator for the charge status.I've been a Bose fan for many years and I have a first generation Bose SoundDock that I use almost daily.  So I had the opportunity to compare the two devices side by side playing an iPod track on the Bose and the same track playing off of  Youtube on my tablet on the Jabra.)  I'm biased towards Bose and yet I was impressed with how well the Jabra sounded.  I would not hesitate to use the Jabra in place of the Bose with my iPod at any time.Are there any negatives? Probably just the price.  I was considering getting a SoundDock portable before I got this unit.  It's pricey for sure but it stacks up well, looks nicer than the Bose does, have more capabilities and is easier to carry.  And it will likely stand up better to the weather and is better suited for use around the pool.This is a great product that easily deserves a high rating and a strong recommendation!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FX6LRG2" id="B00FX6LRG2-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-22:</strong> Jabra isn't a name that immediately springs to mind when you think speakers, JBL, Bose, Klipsch maybe but Jabra is a name I know and associate with hands free phone kits.That I suppose makes sense, as this is a Bluetooth portable wireless speaker, that has an excellent WiFi signal pickup compared to others I have tried.It is however, not what I would consider portable by any stretch of the imagination.The unit weighs in at just under 5 pounds, is over 12"x6" in size and pretty cumbersome for backpacking or taking to the beach.It is however weather proof (or at least claims to be) so will be great for summer evenings in the backyard grilling out, without worrying about dirt, dust or water resistance.Rechargeable battery is great, and pretty long lasting, main AC power option is also available, and I like the on board cable storage if you are taking this with you.Sound is actually very good, two woofers, and two tweeters give a nice range, and with the bass radiator you can hear the deep tones, and there is little resonance at high volume, it certainly is loud.With accessory port to charge your phone, and compatibility with just about any Bluetooth enabled device it's a nice package.I gave it four stars and not five for two reasons really, first the aforementioned lack of real portability, but second (and mostly) the price. This unit is not cheap, and if one is considering this amount of cost, I would probably pay a little more and go for a Bose or better know actual speaker manufacturer.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FX6LRG2" id="B00FX6LRG2-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-27:</strong> I've been putting this through it's paces and it's really a great speaker though there area  couple annoyances that I have found it sitll is a rather good product overall.The GOOD:excellent clarity of music/voicespowerful speakershas a built in microphone to be able to take calls when listening to music.Charge your cell phone on the go/at the beach.usb can also connect to your computer to be used as external speaker.The bad:the microphone doesn't seem to give excellent quality to the other person on the other end until you are within a foot of it. outside of that range it tends to get choppy and not very clear.The button on the top of the device for taking calls needs to be pressed and held in order to initiate voice commands on a galaxy s3 but it often has some odd lag that doesn't allow it to stay active long enough for the voice commands to work...It's heavy...The main annoyance I have is that the microphone is not nearly as good as it should be but that's not enough to really dislike the device. I mostly just use this for music at the office so that I can make the day nicer. I do take some calls though on it so it would be nice to have a better mic on it.The other major issue that I find on it is that if you have it plugged in and then plug in the computer to the USB the device goes nuts and can't establish the fact that it has 2 &#34;power sources&#34; and then it just doesn't work right. So if you like to plug it in when you get home and then want to use it with your laptop at the desk you have to unplug the main power cord and just use the USB. It seems that it would have been much smarter to just put in a simple relay in the device that would prevent it from getting too much power. So if the device is plugged in and USB is connected a simple relay disengages the power supply line (16v) so that it doesn't get too much power.One other issue is the fact that the volume isn't completely controlled via the BlueTooth device connected to it, The main volume has to be set on the speaker and then the bluetooth device can change it's volume separately. It would just be a lot nicer to be able to completely control the volume from the USB device.Also the speakers can get distorted at higher levels, unlike some other bluetooth speakers that I have tried of the last few years.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FX6LRG2" id="B00FX6LRG2-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-16:</strong> So far I have used the speaker system through my MacAir and iphone.

Speaker sets like this make it much more convenient to do that.Last June I selected and reviewed an NYNE NB-230 Bluetooth speaker which is much less expensive than this Jabra. The critical question is then just how much better is this guy than the less expensive NYNE set?That's a tricky question, but it is better, in some ways MUCH better.First, the Solemate Max without doubt has much more bass output. In fact it is easily the best bass I've ever heard on a speaker of its size. This speaker set is very heavy for the size, and heavy bass makes it vibrate. The bass of course doesn't rival what I get from my tower speakers, but compared to other portable speakers it is most impressive.Second, the Max doesn't lose fidelity at high volumes. The music stays crisp and undistorted. This remains true even with the source device volume AND the speaker's volume all the way up.Third, mid and high range reproduction is very good. I have a little mix I created of the theme from "The Princess Bride" which I started off with part of the sword fight at the top of the cliff. The clash of steel on steel actually sounded better from this little guy than it does from my home theater system. The one caveat here is that from some angles close to the Max, the mid-range tones sound a touch muddy. However, if you back off a few feet, it sounds great. Obviously it needs a little acoustics help, but that help is easy to give it ... just a little space. :-) I have not yet tried the app which goes along with this (it includes an equalizer) but that may also help this minor shortcoming.NOTE: I tried to install the app, but it needs a version of iPad ios that is beyond my first generation iPad ... so no joy there. :-( I also could not find a way to add their Android version of the app to my Kindle Fire HD, although I do have a separate equalizer app from a FAotD a few months back.Once of the things I REALLY like about this speaker is that it is rechargeable. That's getting to be a standard feature of speakers like this, but it wasn't a few years ago when I first started to look for them. Not only is it rechargeable, it will also recharge your portable device when it is connected via USB ... not an essential feature but it is something that could come in handy on occasion.Connecting via Bluetooth is a snap. Press the power switch all the way up and hold it for three seconds. Tap connect on your device ... done. The Max even has a sexy voice prompt to let you know what is going on, and that you are successfully connected.You can also connect to it from the headphone jack, and it includes a cable which cleverly works around the base of the Max for convenient storage. However, when you use the headphone cable, you will need to turn up the volume on the Max CONSIDERABLY over using Bluetooth for some reason. You can still get the same volume levels from both connection methods, you just have to adjust when you make the switch.As I mention volume, the Max does put out an impressive amount of volume when you crank it all the way up. Like all good portable speakers, it beeps to let you know when you have maxed out the volume so that you don't try to wear out the + control.In addition to volume controls, you also have Pause/Play and Skip Forward/Back controls right on the speaker. It will also work as a hands free device for your phone.A USB (cable also included) connection to your computer will let the Max serve as computer speakers too, so that you can play content directly from your desktop at home, or a notebook on the go.The Max has a thick and sturdy rubber base which is removable. The base acts as a buffer to keep the Max from walking off a table or countertop as the bass vibrates it.The Max will now be my speaker set of choice for our portable music listening needs.I'm impressed with this product. I think a lot of thought went into the design, and solid engineering went into the specs.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FX6LRG2" id="B00FX6LRG2-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-26:</strong> I have a few wireless and Bluetooth speaker set-ups and I can't really say that this is better or worse than others.  The charging capability for your device is a positive, and the NFC capability is kind of a neat trick for Android phones.To a large degree, though, it comes down to the sound and, honestly, sub-par.  It's not bad and, actually, fairly good.  But I have a Bose wireless speaker that's a couple of years old and I just expected better out of this, particularly because it has more speakers.  It just sounded a bit muffled, not terribly and not enough to say, &#34;Don't buy this,&#34; but the sound quality is not going to knock your socks off.I did like the ease of connecting it and the little automated voice prompt to tell me I was connected.  I like the look of it.  Is it worth $400?  I'd like to say yes.  If it sounded a little better, I'd be saying YES!  I'd challenge the overall resistance it has to the elements, but assuming it's rugged enough to take outdoors frequently, if that's your gig, I do think it's worth $400.  Beyond that, maybe, wait for a price drop.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FX6LRG2" id="B00FX6LRG2-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-20:</strong> SoleMate Max Bluetooth SpeakerManufacturer: JabraAmazon price: $399.00Two tweeters, two woofers, and a passive radiator combine to produce stunning sound quality from a rugged and portable unit. Turn it on, pair it with your smartphone or iPad, and have access to all of your music, audio from movies and YouTube, as well as your streaming music services.The SoleMate Max includes a registration code for the Jabra Sound App. Download and install it on your phone and you'll have additional control with an equalizer and Dolby Sound Space technology. Overall bass response has been customized by Jabra's sound engineers and it sounds good for most music but if you need to back it off a bit, the equalizer will come in handy.This unit contains a really good rechargeable battery. You'll get about 14 hours of use on a charge. That's impressive. If you are listening to music from your phone and a call comes in, the SoleMate Max pauses so you can answer via a built-in mic. The speakerphone sound quality is really good.There are several ways to play music from the SoleMate Max. Press upward on the On/Off switch to get to the Bluetooth pairing mode. You'll hear voice-guided instructions. I was connected in seconds. Bluetooth stays connected within 30 foot radius. If you have an NFC device, just tap it on the target on the right side of the unit and a connection is established. Built into a groove in the rubber sole of the unit, is a two-foot cable with 3.5MM plugs at each end. Use it to connect the SoleMate Max to any device with an audio-out socket. Because there is a built-in USB port on the unit, you can connect directly to a Mac or PC for sound output.The SoleMate Max is really rugged. Jabra claims that it is dust and splash resistant, and with the thick rubber tread on its base, it will take the bumps and bruises of portability and outdoor use. The rubber base keeps the unit from rattling on the table when the bass is heavy. Thanks to its tidy, subdued design, the unit also looks tailored and elegant indoors. There is even a USB port on the side that allows you to charge your phone from the unit. A small point: there is a flexible silicone carrying handle on the left side of the SoleMate Max. I'd be happier if it was removable as it detracts a bit from the unit's sleek look when it's in our living room.I am a music fan and listen to a wide assortment of genres: Pop, Classical, Bluegrass, Opera, and Rock. In addition, I subscribe to several podcasts. The sonic quality in nearly all cases is excellent, room-filling, and immensely satisfying. Crank the volume and things get loud without distortion.There has been long a string of Bluetooth speakers that have made appearances over the past few years and they range from barely adequate to pretty darned good. The big, spectacular sound that the SoleMate Max produces totally eclipses these predecessors. The first time you turn this unit on, you'll be astonished with the presence and well-balanced sound spectrum. You'll find yourself rediscovering your existing music collection all over again.If you can manage the rather steep price, this is a truly superior speaker system. You get what you pay for, and with the SoleMate Max, you get a lot. Highly recommended.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FX6LRG2" id="B00FX6LRG2-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-05:</strong> Setup is easy, just connect it and flip a switch.I use the Jabra Solemate Max to play music from my mobile devices (iPhone, iPad).

You can make a custom setting.This is the best quality speaker our family has ever used.It can go quite loud. It's suitable not just for personal use but for playing music that can be heard through a couple of rooms such as for a casual or dinner party.

The speaker kicks out some considerable volume despite its small size.  When using to sync with music on my iphone I was very impressed with the sound quality, which was quite good.  The unit is not as light as I thought it might be, but it is very compact and not at all cumbersome to transport.  I want to look into getting a bluetooth microphone to sync with this so I can speak into a microphone, rather than holding my iphone for speaking into.  - This unit is definitely built for durability and looks like I will be able to get lots of mileage out of it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FX6LRG2" id="B00FX6LRG2-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-19:</strong> The Solemate Max is a heavy and solid piece of gear.  Jabra thought of just about everything when designing a Bluetooth speaker.  It has everything anyone has ever asked for: portability, weather-proof durability, decent sound, wire/wireless operation including NFC, speakerphone.  The question is whether they managed to do it all well?First, the sound quality is decent.  The lows are not that earth shattering. It&#8217;s what you would expect from &#60; 3&#8221; drivers.  There&#8217;s only so much you can do as simple physics takes over. Mids and highs are clear, not tinny like some of the cheaper speakers.  Overall, the sound is a 3.5 out of 5.The paring is easy and rock solid. I haven&#8217;t experienced any dropped connection unlike a Belkin Bluetooth wireless stereo connector that I own.  The Solemate will sleep requiring you to reconnect the next time your device is near it.  Once your device has paired with the Solemate, your device will retain the selection on your device so you&#8217;ll only need to select the Solemate on your device the next time you want to connect.  You may have to first toggle the Solemate on as it goes to sleep after it&#8217;s disconnected for a period of time.The speakerphone is a nice feature but not entirely effective.  The sounds from the speaker is fine but the receiver on the other end will have a hard time hearing the caller as the noise filtering microphone is not loud enough.  You&#8217;ll have to shout or get really close to the Solemate if you want to be heard.  To use the speakphone is easy, once you&#8217;re connected just dial your number on your phone and you&#8217;ll be able to select the Solemate as your choice.You can also recharge your other devices using the built in USB connection. The battery itself doesn&#8217;t seem that large in capacity.  There are no specs regarding the mAh of the battery so there&#8217;s no way to tell how much juice you have to recharge another device.The design of the integrated cable for connecting any device by wire is ingenious. You&#8217;ll always have the cable with you as it&#8217;s tucked neatly on the bottom of the speaker. You can see it in the photo.  It&#8217;s the yellow cord that&#8217;s wrapped inside the bottom cover. It has male 3.5 mm jacks on both ends.I don&#8217;t have a NFC enabled devise so I can&#8217;t really test that function.  In addition I didn&#8217;t download their app to utilize the Dolby Surround function.Overall, it&#8217;s a decent unit that reminds me of the boom-boxes from the 80&#8217;s. It can get decent volume but don&#8217;t expect tremendous range in the low end. I think it&#8217;s a bit expensive for what it does.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FX6LRG2" id="B00FX6LRG2-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-25:</strong> The Jabra Solemate Max is an amazing little speaker with big sound.

I am contrasting all 4 speakers here.(note I will be adding the Bose Soundlink 3 information in the coming days, after I test it more [UPDATE: added information on the Soundlink 3)Sound Quality------------------Surprisingly the Soundlink mini has the best sound. Unfortunately, you can't really crank it too high due to its small size. But it stood out slightly as the more clear sound of all 4 speakers.1. Sound link mini2. Tie between Jabra and Bose Soundlink 2 and 3Sound Volume------------------All three can be cranked up to their highest setting without distortion, which is quite surprising.1. Jabra Max has the highest volume of the 4.2. Soundlink 3 (very close to Jabra)3. Soundlink 2 is close behind (almost as loud as the 3)4. Sounlink miniConstruction Quality:--------------------------This is a 4 way tie. All43 are exceptional made, though very different.In no particular order:The Soundlink mini has a great aluminum construction, reminiscent of apple macbook pros.The Soundlink 2 has a built in cover, which can be used conveniently as a stand, it is solidly built hard plastic shell (good quality).The Soundlink 3 looks a bit like the Jabra, with the size of the 2.The Solemate has a more rugged construction. Instead of exposed aluminum or hard plastic, it has a rubbery feel on a very strong foundation. It doesn't have a built in case, thought they sell cases for it.Size:------1. Soundlink mini is significantly smaller.2. Bose Soundlink is an in-between size of these two. Both the sound link 2 and the sound link 3 are almost the same size.3. The Solemate max is a big speaker, it is roughly 3 times the volume of the Soundlink 2. Longer, thicker and just as tall.Weather/Water--------------------1. Jabra definitely has the edge here. The rubber construction and everything about it, is made to withstand some weather. It is said to be dust and water resistant (not water proof!!!), the buttons do not protrude like the others, but rest underneath the rubber layer. Despite that they are easy to click. This is the one to get if you are going to the beach. The rubber construction also allows it to take a fall and not miss a beat.2. Tie. Neither Bose speaker is something I'd want to bump too much. The aluminum of the mini might be a tad more durable, but neither offers any protection against the weather.Battery Life:---------------1. Jabra has a longer battery life, closer to 14 depending on volume. Tied with the Soundlink 3.2. Soundlink 2 and mini both have the same around 7 hour life.Speaker phone/mic-------------------1. Jabra can be used to answer phone calls and talk as a speaker phone.2. None of the 3 Bose speakers can do this.Price:-------1. Soundlink mini and the Sounlink 2 tie for first place. While the mini is about $70 cheaper, it doesn't come with a built in case, and the output volume does not get very high, so I give it equal value.2. The Sounlink 3, is $30 dollars more than the Soundlink 2, but doesn't have a built in cover ($additional $40 value to get one now)  and it doesn't improve much over the Soundlink 2 other than a longer battery life.3. The Jabra is close to $400, and at that price point its hard to justify over the competition given that it doesn't have any advantage over them, except if you truly value rugged design and will be taking it to a lot of beach trips.Bluetooth pairing:-----------------------1. Jabra takes first place here. It is extremely easy to pair. And it speaks to you when it does: "Connected". I tried from my phone and my computer and both connected easily and flawlessly. Turning the phone bluetooth on or off, coming a day later, it doesn't matter, it's just a matter of selecting the Jabra speaker from the list of options and it connects. No extra work needed.2. All 3 Bose speakers act the same way. Connection and pairing is easy, but most of the time when you want to connect again (a day later, or after disabling bluetooth to save on cell battery for a bit) you need to go to the speaker and click on the bluetooth icon to again make it available to be connected to. *Most of the time*  Some people might have more success but for me, most of the time I needed to do this. It wouldn't just connect when I selected Bose from the drop down like it does for the Jabra system.NFC------1. Jabra has NFC, which means some cellphones can connect to it with a simple tap. That's great.2. Bose still hasn't put NFC on any of their products, including the just released Soundlink 3.Overall, I am disappointed on Jabra. The package underwhelms in most ways except ruggedness.It's much larger than Bose but has the same battery life and virtually the same sound output as the smaller sound link 3. The sound quality is virtually identical to the Soundlink 2/3 as well. The addition of a speaker phone might be useful to some, but I have a hard time justifying the $400 price tag compared to $270 or $299 of the Bose Soundlink systems.If it were the same price as the Soundlink I would have given it 4 stars, but as it stands, it's asking significantly more money than competing products, while not bringing enough value in return and being larger/heavier.That said - it is not a bad system, it's just not priced correctly. If you do plan on going to the beach a lot and using it in adverse weather, than the extra cost might be worth it. Otherwise you're better off with the smaller and equally good sounding Bose.note:If you don't care about high volume, the Bose Soundlink mini has the best sound of the bunch but probably just for a small office in quiet area.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FX6LRG2" id="B00FX6LRG2-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-28:</strong> The Jabra Solemate Max does put out a big sound. For the price (currently $399 on Amazon), it really should. I think it gets a little louder than the only other bluetooth speaker I have access to, the Bose Soundlink Mini, but it is twice the price. This speaker should put out a better sound, as it is not only more expensive but considerably larger and heavier. This speaker is able to keep its clarity very well while cranking the sound to the max.The first thing you notice when you get this speaker is the heft. It is very portable, but you will notice that you're lugging it to wherever it is you're going (at least in comparison to other speakers). The handle is a very nice feature, though, and is very comfortable.Hooking this up to your phone or iPod via bluetooth is extremely easy. You hold the power button up for about three seconds, then the speaker will instruct you to connect with your phone. It will also indicate when you have established a connection, leaving any doubt out of the equation. You can also use a headphone jack to connect this speaker, which could come in handy when you want to use this with a hotel's TV, for instance. You can also connect this speaker with a USB cable, which I have not tried. I assume that is very easy to set up, though. The bluetooth connection has worked very well for me. There has been no lost connections so far, and everything has played very well.Jabra also has two cheaper models, so it's not fair to compare this directly to the Soundlink Mini. This was designed to put out a bigger sound, and I think it accomplishes it. There are also fringe benefits like being able to charge your phone with the speaker's USB port. The rechargeable battery is supposed to last twice as long; so far, I haven't run out. I should be getting pretty close, I think, but I haven't been keeping exact count. It seems like I have to charge the Soundlink Mini way more often, even if it's been in standby mode.Overall, this thing is very user-friendly and puts out a great sound. If you're looking for a top-of-the-line bluetooth speaker, this is a good one to choose. It appears to be very well made, and should hold up quite well while being lugged around.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FX6LRG2" id="B00FX6LRG2-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-24:</strong> I love to take music on the go.

There are woofers, and tweeters and a built-in bass. Certainly they sound like it. You can hear the entire range of sound and it isn't muddled. There's also a protective rubber casing on the bottom and top so that it would be easy to take them outdoors.

The Max is the biggest speaker of the Jabra line, measuring 13.8 x 5.8 x 5.8 inches and weighing more than seven pounds. With that size, however, comes the ability to deliver room-filling sound. The Solemate Max has two tweeters, two woofers and a custom-designed proprietary bass that delivers very clear and crisp lows.I tested the Solemate Max with all different types of music, from classical to jazz, to rock and rhythm and blues and even disco. The Solemate Max performed very well, delivering crisp highs and resonant lows. Because the Solemate Max produces enough sound to easily fill a large room it would be perfect for parties or events with lots of people.Jabra also has an app (for both iOS and Android devices) that acts as a music player for your device. The Jabra Sound App (you need a specific code, which Jabra provides in the box, to activate the app) allows you to customize the sound with an equalizer and Dolby sound). The equalizer has a number of pre-sets and gives you the ability to create, but not save, a custom preset). I tried the app on both my iPod Touch and Android devices. The app works reasonably well but on a few occasions the sound dropped when I was using the app with my Android MP3 player. If you already have a music player on your device (such as Equalizer or Poweramp) or if you are happy with the stock equalizer you may not need to use the app.In addition to producing great sound the Solemate Max also has Near Field Communication (NFC), so you can connect your phone to the speaker by tapping it, built-in speakerphone capabilities, Jabra's integrated cable (located at the "sole" of the speaker, making it hard to lose), a battery rated at providing 14 hours of talk time/music time, a USB connector and a phone charging port. The speaker also has a carry strap and because of its size and weight seems very durable. The Max is also dirt and splash resistant. Pairing the speaker with a device is simple: just hold the pairing button up for about four seconds and you get voice prompts to help you pair your device.I own a number of Bluetooth speakers and usually list the TDK-A33 and Ultimate Ears Boom as my favorites. Both produce very good sound but are much smaller than the Solemate Max, which is made to compete with higher priced speakers from Bose, Klipsch, and even the Sonos line of multi-room speaker systems.I highly recommend the Jabra Solemate Max. While not inexpensive, these days most people no longer use expensive multi-component sound systems and rely on music from small, portable devices. A speaker that produces quality, room-filling sound is important, especially if you enjoy listening to different types of music or consider music a hobby. The Jabra Solemate Max produces excellent, room-filling, well-balanced sound and has other features (such as the ability to charge your phone, and a long-lasting battery) that makes this a premium Bluetooth speaker.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FX6LRG2" id="B00FX6LRG2-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-24:</strong> - The battery life is long.

I was able to pair it with an iPod, iPhone, and two computers in only a few minutes (though Bluetooth technology only really works with one at a time!).- It's charged straight out of the box.- Music plays with a lot of clarity; what you'd expect for a $400 device. It produces a pleasant &#34;all around&#34; sound with a nice range of highs and lows. The bass sounds great if you put it on the floor.- It will actually charge your phone if your phone is plugged into it. Nice little detail.- You'll notice in one of the product photos that it is slanted. It actually &#34;looks up&#34; at you.- Thanks to its soft casing, it will never scratch anything you place it on.- It gets LOUD.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FX6LRG2" id="B00FX6LRG2-review21" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-02:</strong> Hooking up this device to an I phone was just so easy.  The Bluetooth connection was very simple to do.  The free Jabra software downloaded quickly and the connection itself was as automatic as they get.The sound is great.  Looking forward to using this at the pool since it is sturdy enough to be good for that.

It comes with a floppy carrying loop/handle for portability.  The handle felt securely attached during transportation.  The speaker is not heavy, weighing around five pounds.  It has a rugged looking veneer, fingerprint-proof material, and rubberer-ized bottom which prevents slippage.Pairing with my phone could not have been more straightforward.  I was unable to connect via NFC due to problems with my Galaxy S3, but Bluetooth pairing was very easy and took all of three seconds to finish.  The pairing process was further aided by verbal directions- brilliant!  Although a USB input port is provided, I was disappointed that it did not support playing music off of a USB stick.  Instead, the USB port is for connecting to a computer.Sound quality was very good for jazz and classical music, but lacking in bass.  Changing the equalizer settings on my phone helped, but for $400, Jabra can do better.  Although it was not immediately obvious, the volume +/- buttons on the Solemate were of marginal utility.  Use the volume buttons on your phone or other connected device to control the volume.  I installed the Jabra Sound App, but could not hear any discernible benefit in sound quality so I uninstalled it.  If you have other Jabra BT devices, the app enables control of those as well.  If an incoming call comes thru on the phone, the Solemate pauses the music and transforms into a giant speakerphone.  It worked flawlessly!  Once my call finished, it reverted back to playing music again.In conclusion, the Solemate is a solidly performing Bluetooth speaker.  I've only given it four stars because it ought to have better bass at this price point.  Additionally, the lack of USB stick functionality was disappointing.  If the price drops, I'll upgrade the rating.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FX6LRG2" id="B00FX6LRG2-review23" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-24:</strong> When I first saw the picture of this Jabra stereo with a handle, I thought it was going to be very lightweight.  Thus, I was surprised when I first picked it up and realized it weighed over five pounds.  But in my opinion, any electronic product that is heavy is well-made!  It's also versatile when it comes to connecting devices.  There's Bluetooth and it is extremely simple to connect with Bluetooth.  The Bluetooth even talks to you while connecting.  I just turned it on, went to my phone and turned on the Bluetooth and chose the "device list" setting, and the phone quickly found the Jabra.  I then used another phone to call my phone, and the ringing came in loud and clear over the Jabra speakers. If you use your phone as an alarm clock, the alarm clock sound will also come in loud and clear over the speakers.  My phone is not even a SmartPhone, but a flip phone with Bluetooth. You can also charge your phone with the included USB cord.Connecting my iPod was also simple, although I unfortunately don't have Bluetooth, since I have an iPod Classic.  (That's the one thing I wish they'd add to the Classic--Bluetooth! It needs nothing else but that.)  To connect I used the included 3.5mm cord.  That cord is neatly stored on the bottom of the Jabra, so it's always there. The iPod music sounds very good coming out of the Jabra speaker, but make sure you check your EQ settings on the iPod if you don't think it sounds good.  Like all portable speakers I've ever tried, the equalizer setting greatly determines what you hear from the speakers.  I like heavy treble, and "spoken word" or "treble booster" worked great on this Jabra speaker.  I connected the iPod charge cord to the USB port on the Jabra to see if it would charge the iPod, and it did not, but it never said in the directions it would. Also none of the top buttons worked with the iPod, except the volume ones.  The fast forward and reverse buttons did not. I'm not sure what device those buttons control. I have no music on my phone to test to see if it's a phone alone they control. They didn't work with my laptop while playing music, either, although connecting to my laptop was also easy using the included USB cord. I used my Amazon Cloud player to play music with the laptop and that sounded very nice. Also, I noticed my Tosiba Sattelite laptop has an equalizer, too, which I haven't played with yet.Compared to theSony SRSBTX500 Portable NFC Bluetooth Wireless Premium Speaker System, which I also have, this Jabra is slightly shorter and heavier.  The sound of the Jabra is also more a treble sound, while the Sony has more bass.  (Once again, however, what your equalizer is on greatly affects the sound.) The one shortcoming of the Jabra is the volume gets lower when playing songs that are softer, and songs that are older ones remastered.  I never noticed this before I compared it to the Sony.  I have to actually turn the volume up on the iPod or the Jabra for those type of songs.  The Sony always keeps a consistent volume level.  The Sony is not as ruggedly built as the Jabra, though, and has no carry handle, only a soft travel case.  I never take the Sony out of the house.  This Jabra I'll have no problem taking places, like myEton Soulra XL Solar Powered Sound System for iPod and iPhone - (NSP500B).  The Eton has a shoulder strap for carrying, the Jabra has its handle. The Eton charges an iPod, but is an older non-Bluetooth model.  This Jabra is brand new, and will probably have lots of fans.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FX6LRG2" id="B00FX6LRG2-review24" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-25:</strong> This speaker system is perfect for our home Gym and our outside patio area.  My wife and I like to listen to music when we workout, but not the same type of music.  This makes it really easy for us to pair our iPhones or iPads so whoever is down in the basement just has to take their music along.When I am walking I also like to watch technical videos.  Using this speaker lets me get the volume load enough to clearly hear it.  Before I was plugging my iPad into the treadmill and those speakers are not that great.It is also nice for grabbing and taking outside.

Here&#8217;s my report on it.Out of the box it&#8217;s a sturdy, handsome unit with a durable grey metal mesh and black trim with a rubberized carry handle at one end for easy transport. On the opposite end is a charging LED, the On/Off/Pairing switch, a 3.5mm jack, a mini USB port and a full-sized USB port for phone charging. On top are the controls: a Play/Pause with volume control and a skip forward and skip reverse. Another button shows the battery status while serving as an Answer/End control. A cable stores neatly into the underside.What is inside is nothing short of amazing. Two tweeters and two powerful woofers with a bass radiator deliver big, extraordinarily clear sound. I have a Bose Wave radio in my kitchen, and it sounds good, but when I play podcasts or music from Pandora on the Jabra, it sounds even better. That&#8217;s saying something for a smallish portable unit. I&#8217;ve put it through the paces with a variety of music from Baroque brass to Renaissance lute, and it picks up every nuance. I&#8217;ve even used it outdoors in my greenhouse and delighted in the crisp, clear sounds. An added plus for that location is that it&#8217;s dirt, dust and water resistant.The Soulmate Max&#8217;s rechargeable battery life is great: fourteen hours for music or talk and up to 130 days standby time (of course I haven&#8217;t had it long enough to actually test the standby time). It takes about 2.5 hours for a full charge, however, it can be used while charging as well.I paired it to my phone which, although not a smartphone, does have Bluetooth capability and a memory card with an extensive playlist. I mainly use it with my Kindle Fire (alas, not Bluetooth enabled) to listen to podcasts and Pandora Radio. I have not tested it with my cellphone because I live in an area with no cell reception.Using the Jabra sound app gives the added boost of Dolby technology for the ultimate in sound experience.There are four ways to connect to your music or sound:Option 1: Hold the on/off switch in the up position for 3 seconds. Pairing mode will be announced, and the Bluetooth light will flash. Follow the voice-guided pairing instrutions. You don&#8217;t have to have your Kindle near the unit; you&#8217;ll get high quality audio from any Bluetooth device up to a distance of 33 feet. Option 2: Enable NFC on your mobile device. Locate and gently tap the NFC zone on themobile device against the NFC zone on the Jabra Solemate Max. Option 3: Use the cable located in the bottom of the sole to plug directly into a 3. 5mm audio jack. Option 4: Find a free USB slot on your PC and plug in the micro USB cable. This way you can set the Jabra Solemate Max as the default audio device under &#8216;Sound and Audio devices&#8217; in your operating system. I have a set of Logitech speakers for my desktop, but adding the Jabra Soulmate Max ramped up the sound quality for watching Netflix movies and Torrent downloads.All in all, it&#8217;s an attractive, ruggedly built speaker system with fantastic sound and so portable. I love it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FX6LRG2" id="B00FX6LRG2-review26" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-27:</strong> The Jabra SOLEMATE MAX Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Speakers provide awesome sound in a relatively small package.

Setting up the Bluetooth was very easy. The speakers have multiple methods of connection so you will definitely find a way to connect even if you do not have Bluetooth. The charges lasts a long time so you will get a lot of listening pleasure and still have power to recharge your phone.Very nice product that I highly recommend.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00FX6LRG2', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00FX6LRG2', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B0025W5RX6</h2>    <p class="price"> $B0025W5RX6</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0025W5RX6" id="B0025W5RX6-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-30:</strong> I love this phone.

I bought it to be able to access the internet and check my online calendar and email.  As a voice and text phone, it functions quite well.  However the internet and "smartphone" features are pretty weak.The default browser on the phone is just "ok", but doesn't support the necessary security protocols to be able to access my webmail.  It also has a bunch of super annoying "locked" bookmarks, which you can't modify or remove.  I bought the darned phone, shouldn't I at least be able to set up bookmarks in my own browser?  Regardless, what I would highly recommend doing is installing Opera Mini (works great) and using that instead of the default browser.  My webmail works like a charm on that.Along the same lines, there are a bunch of paid services (GPS, weather, games) which are *locked* within the menus.  The phone will allow you to remove the free services if you like, but the ones are subscription based cannot be modified.  It's as if they are saying "pleeeeaassee buy this service".  One time I accidentally activated AT&T; navigator by forgetting to lock the phone when I put it in my pocket.  Of course there was no way to opt-out through the phone, so I had to call AT&T; to get it taken care of.Physically the phone is built well, with a robust slide out keyboard.  It really snaps in and out of place very firmly and feel substantial.  After one year it's just as structurally sound as it was on day one - and yes I've dropped it a couple times.  Like most phones, the shiny front and plastic backing will become scratched over time.  Reception is generally good and dropped calls are rare.So overall this is a nice phone, but I wouldn't qualify it as a "smartphone".  If you need serious internet or multimedia features, buy and Android or iPhone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0025W5RX6" id="B0025W5RX6-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-06:</strong> My cousin got this phone, and has had 2 replacements and has never had it wet or even abused the phone any.

I used up the minutes in about 6 months, but this was still a good savings off other options for light cell phone user who uses a Magicjack plus at home for longer conversations including the typical sitting on hold for customer service type calls.I discovered the newer LG 840 online when I realized that just buying more minutes wasn't much cheaper than buying the phone/minutes packages.As others have said, this includes some improvements over the 800 which was itself is a pretty decent phone for the money.After the new phone arrived, I tried to transfer my contacts via bluetooth between the phones as others suggested. I ended up doing it by swapping microsd cards between phones instead.After that, transferring my number and remaining minutes from the 800 to the 840 was pretty easy and quick using the tracfone website.Unfortunately I haven't found the 840 on Amazon with the kind of minutes package I got the 800 with. I did find it with 1400 minutes on HSN's website though. ( I wonder if they will delete this ?) I always look on Amazon first though. I only look elsewhere if what I want is sold out or otherwise unavailable here - which is fortunately pretty rare.But I recommended the phone and any accessories you may want here, and maybe they will get their turn to offer a phone plus minutes package on this one as they had with the 800 - once the other-guy's exclusive on that ends.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009LRNLW2" id="B009LRNLW2-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-28:</strong> Great phone.

Additionally to magnify the screen you can not touch expand, there is a icon to select to magnify the screen for each screen being viewed. In the browser a selection for landscape is available.  Also the on-screen, keypad doesn't come up when needed for data entry on WiFi browsing. The telephone keypad comes up and you must press buttons forever to enter data. WiFi works in a pinch but is difficult to navigate with no screen keyboard other than the telephone type keypad.  Screen visibility of web pages does not have resolution of smart phones.Texting is fine with the keyboard appearing in the landscape mode.  Having said these shortcomings. I must confess I have not used this phone exclusively yet so observations of limitations might change once the time expires on the LG400 and I begin using LG840 exclusively. So bottom line so far is: use as a phone is good, the auto shut down of the screen prevents 911 calling by accident, Texting is OK but lack of screen auto rotating to landscape and a screen keyboard for all apps is a real pain.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009LRNLW2" id="B009LRNLW2-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-26:</strong> So far I love the phone.

You can also hear people pretty well on this one. Hardly any crackle at all.-The touch function works really well and there isn't any lag. And the buttons on the bottom work the same way, they are not click buttons but touch buttons with the same sensitivity. It's really fun and easy to use. One main drawbacks to the touch screen however is that while you're talking to someone you have to make sure you don't touch it to your face because it'll do stuff (e.g., dial numbers, mute the call, hang up, etc.) It's not really that big a deal though, you just have to get use to holding it away from your face a bit... or do like I did and use it as an excuse to get a Bluetooth headset XD Which connects really easily, but more about that later.-The Wi-Fi function works great. As long as you have Wi-Fi active and connected to a router it'll surf the web without taking any of your minutes. You can even watch youtube video's on this one, which is a feature I haven't seen in any other tracfone I've had. I'd suggest only watching them when connect to Wi-Fi though, it takes a lot of minutes to watch them without it. This phone's web browser also has a multi-tab function and bookmarks, which is a nice step up from the other tracfones offered right now.-This phone has Bluetooth capabilities and it works really well. I've had tracfones before that were supposed to have Bluetooth but they were a hassle to connect too for anything. This one connects really fast and simple. Just turn the Bluetooth on and search for the device and wham you're connected to it. Seriously, it's been that easy ever time I go to connect it to something :)-Another cool feature this phone has is the MP3 Player which works really well. You have to get use to how the playlists are set up but after you do it's free sailing. This phone also comes with a Micro SD card so you can store a truck load of songs and photos on this thing without and problems.-The 2MP camera is pretty good. It has a lot of cool options for both taking the photos and editing the photos after they are taken. The video camera function isn't that great however :/ it has a very little resolution and comes out as a little 300x250 box when transferred to your computer...Over all this is a great phone though :) I really love it. Works great for me and I'm really satisfied with it so far.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009LRNLW2" id="B009LRNLW2-review23" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-11:</strong> My kid loves this. The triple minutes for life it great. The cost superb.The way he uses it, he hardly uses any minutes at all. And, after his losing two phones before this (one of which was a contract phone some kid at school stole and we were lucky enough to recover), I feel like he has a phone and I have one less thing to worry about. Because of the price, I won't even be angry if it does get lost or stolen because of the low price. Tracfone - I love you. The online customer service stinks, because no one ever knows how to set up the voicemail and that takes forever. But once you fight through that - you never have to talk to them again. And, what's not to love about this phone?</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009LRNLW2" id="B009LRNLW2-review24" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-09:</strong> UNLIKE THE SAME MODEL PURCHASED A FEW DAYS AFTER THIS, FOR MY WIFE, THIS PHONE WORKS FINE AND TRANSFERRED MINUTES AND NUMBER CORRECTLY.

HOWEVER, SO IS U.S. PHONE CO. SERVICE AND WE CANCELLED OUR LANDLINE DUE TO LACK OF SERVICE. The battery life is only about 2.5 days without talking.  It's a 1000 milliamp hour battery and the phone draws 15 MA/hr.(I meassured) when on standby. That's 66.6 hrs. It's lots more with the screen on!

It could be because it's an AT&T provider in my area.  If I had to do it over again, I'd just go with one of Tracfone's new Android phones.  In my area the Androids use Verizon which is much stronger a signal here.  Be sure and check the Tracfone website to be sure this phone will work in your zip code.  This phone is cumbersome with the internet feature - it's not worth the hassle, but the phone, texting and other features are fine (when you can get a signal).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009LRNLW2" id="B009LRNLW2-review26" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-20:</strong> I love my phone I have had tracfones for over 10 yrs and this is one of the best, I received it with in a couple of days of ordering it, It was just what the seller said it was.

I absolutely loved this phone and its features - one of the nicest phones Tracfone has on the market, however, I had horrible reception with this phone inside my home, which sits in a valley. I would lose signal completely multiple times a day, and spent countless hours trying to restart it or step outside to gain signal back, only to lose it again.  After some research, I discovered there are two types of Tracfones, G and C models. This is a G model phone, which uses AT&T towers. I had to make a switch to a C model phone which uses Verizon towers. Since the switch, I have no reception issues whatsoever, and consistently have 5 bars for signal strength. I was very disappointed that I couldn't use this phone like I wanted because it is such a nice little phone. I called Tracfone several times to try to resolve the issue and was always told I had the best phone for my area (a lie, I now know a Verizon phone is actually the best for my area), and finally I just gave up, sold it, and bought something else.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009LRNLW2" id="B009LRNLW2-review29" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-08:</strong> First Off, I am not New to Tracfone. I have had this phone before. The reason I stopped using it was I went to an Android phone. I found myself turning into one of those zombies staring at their phone all day. Back to the Basic Phone! This tracfone is touch screen and the Touch screen responds very well. It comes with a 2gb memory card. I have put music on it and it works very well as an MP3 plater. I like the size of this phone. It fits well in my hand and slips into a small phone case as well. I have found the battery life to be very good on this also. This Phone has Wifi too, In other words, surf the web, say, if you go to a coffeeshop that has wifi and not use your minutes! Free is always good! I was able to get my gmail on here as well. Use the POP setting for your mail or it will keep giving you an error. I bought a case for the phone too right here on Amazon. If you want a very good basic phone and want to sort of &#34;Upgrade for the standard Basic phone, then give this a try. It's very easy and fun to use!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009LRNLW2" id="B009LRNLW2-review30" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-08:</strong> While I found the LG800g to be good and functional after an accident it wasn't working so good afterwords so I had to decide repurchase the 800g or go for this one for the same price.After having this cellphone for about a week I found it to be a good choice,the touchscreen and online capabilities are definitely better then the earlier model and with the added bonus of getting triple minutes instead of double. Again a word of warning though this is a prepaid cellphone and while it does have some decent capabilities it obviously isn't going to match up to a Samsung Galaxy and the like so if you want those bells and whistles you should just get a contract cellphone instead.The cellphone is pretty sturdy about the same as the LG800g and could probably handle a drop relatively safely(Though mine got stepped on by a heavyset person before I could pick it up again)but you can get a protective cover pretty cheap here as well if it makes you feel safer.So again for those who have needed a phone in a dire or problematic situation here's a very affordable one to get without the hassle of signing up for a yearly contract and worrying about monthly costs or early cancellation fees but also remember if you're one of those need to have the latest model to keep with the fashion crowd then obviously this phone isn't going to be for you.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009LRNLW2" id="B009LRNLW2-review31" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-30:</strong> Excellent.

My daughter arrived last year and as a result my cellphone usage slightly went up but still not high enough to justify a contract phone with the monthly bills. My wife has a company IPhone and from time to time I do envy her ability to get online just about anywhere. Too bad that tracfone doesn't offer a smartphone, and the LG 840g is probably the closest that they have.I bought this phone for $99 from Amazon with the 1200 minute package, with the additional 250 minutes coupon code (obtained directly from tracfone's own website) this is a very good deal. Considering normally the 400 minute time card would cost you $99 (this is a triple-minute phone, hence the 1200 min), I basically got the phone for free.After having played with the phone for a few days, here are my findings. First the positives:1) In terms of functionality, this is just what I am looking for. Long standby time, touch screen, a web browser that I can use to check some info when needed, an email client, and the optional Google Maps app, a good-enough camera/camcorder. Nothing fancy, but something that does the job in a pinch.2) The phone has a high-quality feel to it. People will believe you if you tell them it's one of those Android smartphones, unlike the previous prepaid phones that I had, which all looked low-cost.3) I have managed to install the signed (and touch-enabled) versions of UC Browser, Opera Mini 4.4 and 5.1 (7.1 is too sluggish), and Google Maps. All apps run fullscreen without the virtual keypad. The trick is to download the signed jar and jad file, and append to the JAD file the following linesNokia-MIDlet-No-Exit: trueNokia-MIDlet-On-Screen-Keypad: noMIDlet-Touch-Support: trueUseNativeTextButtons: hideReverseSoftkeys: hideUseNativeCommands: hideNavi-Key-Hidden: trueMIDlet-ScreenMode: ROTATEMIDlet-Landscape-Support: trueLGE-MIDlet-Width: 320LGE-MIDlet-Height: 480LGE-MIDlet-On-Screen-Keypad: noLGE-MIDlet-Display-Mode: bothLGE-MIDlet-TargetLCD-Height: 320LGE-MIDlet-TargetLCD-Width: 480LGE-MIDlet-Indicator: HIDESave, copy both to the phone via data cable or bluetooth, use File Manager to browse and install JAD file. Everything works beautifully.4) Putting music/video/photos on the phone is as straightforward as copying to directories once you connect the phone to the PC using a microusb data sync cable. The included 2G microsd is plenty for my usage.Now a few minor downsides:1) The qwerty keyboard is not enabled everywhere---I wanted the qwerty keyboard in a touch screen phone. I understand the rationale since the screen resolution is relatively low and a T9 keyboard would result in bigger buttons. But Opera mini 7.1 can display a full qwerty keyboard even in the portrait orientation just fine, so it's certainly doable. At least I would have preferred an option to use the qwerty keyboard by default every time, even if it means switching to landscape mode2) 3G speed is hit-and-miss depending on where you are. At my home I get usable speed, at my office it's too slow. But I don't consider that a reflection on the phone, but rather on AT&T;, which is my local tracfone carrier.3) Unlocking the phone is a two-step process, which I don't like. You have to first press a button and then swipe to unlock. Again I understand the rationale, but the unlock button is very small and almost flush, so it's rather unlikely that you will press the button while it's in your pocket. Again, an option would be nice here.4) The phone disconnects wifi when you are not using it to save battery. Therefore, when you unlock it, you should wait for the wifi icon to show up before you try to use any internet features, otherwise you'd be paying with your tracfone minutes.UPDATE 1: having had the phone for a month now, I am glad to say that my impression hasn't changed. I actually used its 3G capability twice in the past month, in both cases it worked just fine. BTW, tracfone seems to charge your 3G usage by transfered data volume, not by how long you stay online. UC Browser is now my browser on this phone, much better than the default browser client, which was very limited. For those who want to install a signed fullscreen copy of it, here is my packaged file that you can use:[...]download, unpack, copy both files to your phone, then install the JAD file.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009LRNLW2" id="B009LRNLW2-review37" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-13:</strong> I got the phone very quickly, came in new sealed Tracfone packaging + 400 minute 1 year card.  I transferred the phone number from my old tracfone to this one on the website - took about 2 minutes to enter in all the serial numbers and stuff.  The phone switched over the next day - I did receive the &#34;unregistered Sim card&#34; message like some others did - but not an issue, seeing how the new phone had all my minutes and a later expiration date.  Adding the 400 minute card on the website was a breeze - I even used the promo code 86167 for a bonus 250 minutes.  When all was said and done, I ended up paying $104 for a 1 year 400 minute calling card - and got a brand new triple minutes LG 840G phone for FREE!  Great deal - way cheaper than buying from the tracfone site.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009LRNLW2" id="B009LRNLW2-review38" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-14:</strong> To start off, I cannot speak to the call quality / service of this phone.  I bought it to use as a cheap MP3 player along with a 16 Gigabyte micro SD card.Initially I loaded music on the 2 gigabyte card that the phone came with and it worked perfectly.Unfortunately when I replaced the 2 gigabyte card with a 16 gigabyte card the music player began moving at a GLACIAL speed.  I would press a button and wait 10-20 seconds for the phone to responds.  In the meantime if I had pressed the button twice the phone registered both button presses and would take me through two menus instead of the one I was trying.Basically, if you want to use this as an inexpensive music player, you're out of luck as its practically unusable.Otherwise the phone seems pretty good for the price, the touch screen is responsive and the menu is fairly intuitive.  Don't expect an iphone interface, but not a bad cheap smart phone as far as I can tell.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009LRNLW2" id="B009LRNLW2-review39" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-13:</strong> I hate this LG phone (I would give the LG phone just one star) ... it dials previous number without me &#34;really' wanting to do ... but Tracfone service is good (I would give it 5 stars)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B009LRNLW2', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B009LRNLW2', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B008KWCTQS</h2>    <p class="price"> $B008KWCTQS</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008KWCTQS" id="B008KWCTQS-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-11:</strong> Again as an gift!

I was cheap and went for a rubber case at first, then dropped my Mini. Now all four corners are banged up because of it.

Each one of them has fit perfectly.  The Belkin Quilted Cover fits the iPad Mini .Like most "portfolio" style cases, this case snaps in place at each corner with four rubber-like retainers.  The inner lining is soft with a "velvety" feel.  The case secures with a magnetic tab.  When the case is open, the tab can hold the cover open.  PLEASE NOTE: This is a plan magnetic latch, and functions like one would on any portfolio book.  This is not the kind of magnetic component that wakes up the iPad when the case opens.The exterior is a black synthetic material with a leather-like feel.  It is stitched to give the exterior a quilted look and feel.  I really like how this looks and feels.  For people who want the slimmest of protection, this is a portfolio type case, so it will add a little thickness to the device.The case shape and cutouts align with the iPad Mini, and does not interfere at with the camera, power, or volume buttons.There are three notches in the interior to allow you to use the case as a stand, with three viewing positions.I really like this case!  I find it to be very stylish looking, nicely made, and offering excellent protection for your device.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009T0NIXS" id="B009T0NIXS-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-07:</strong> The material is soft, flexible and looks great.

All the girls at the office think it is such a cute case for my iPad mini. Some say it reminds them of a Chanel bag. It does resemble that quilted pattern, which I love so much. The quality of the case is high. It feels nice in your hands. The magnetic tab closure is a nice touch. No snapping or velcro to deal with. The protective corners are great in providing protection to the iPad mini. The corners hold the mini very well and you don't have to worry of the mini popping out if you were to drop it. The viewing angles are a nice extra touch on a case like this. This case is not just for looks it also has function with the viewing angles. The camera hole in the back lines up perfect unlike other cases out there. If you are looking for a case for your mini then stop looking and go this one.

It fits the iPad Mini like a glove by sliding each corner into a rubber protective corners. There is little chance that it will come loose from the case unless you purposely remove it. The inside of the case is black and very smooth and almost feels like felt except it's softer. The exterior has a unique quilted pattern that gives it a very cool look and gives it more cushion and protection than the average case. The exterior is dark black and is very smooth and sleek and feels great to the touch. It has a magnet built into the front cover as well so it will turn on or off the iPad simply by opening or closing the flap.

I liked the color (cream--definitely not white or beige), the texture/padding and that it gives excellent protection. I liked the magnetic clip that closes it and I especially like the way it secures the iPad (fits snuggly into plastic corners, better, imo, that some of the other cases with elasticized straps.)What didn't I like? That it makes the iPad take up so much more space. Why did tablets decide not to use a cover? I suppose they're cost-cutting, but unless you drop it, a plastic cover would probably be adequate most of the time. But, other tablets don't have built-in plastic covers either so...it is what it is. I will just add that this -only- works with iPad, the plastic corners really are bult for this, not Nook or Kindle, so not flexible enough to double up for any other brand. Not a bad thing, but good to know, I think.Also, like the vast majority of cases/stands, the stand works fine horizontally but is not at all useful when you try to use it to support itself vertically. For that, I think only the velcro designs where you can attach/reattach different parts of it yourself, will give any kind of useful viewing/reading angle. Otherwise, nice case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009T0NIXS" id="B009T0NIXS-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-13:</strong> My iPad mini fits perfectly into the case and the outside leather feels great, very soft. it also stands great on it's side with the case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009T0NIXS" id="B009T0NIXS-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-16:</strong> I was worried that the quilting on here would be cotton, but in fact it's a nice washable sturdy vinyl.

I think I spent about twice the money. It covered the front, but offered no protection for the back. On top of that, it didn't stay magnetized very well. One day I was using it and it came apart and the iPad itself came crashing to the floor. Luckily, I was in a sitting position so it didn't fall far or cause harm to the device, but everybody was looking at me like I had fallen asleep. Then I got this.This is great! It covers the entire device and keeps it well protected. Coincidently, the DAY I put my iPad in this I had something slam into it, and it protected the iPad just fine. If I was still using the Apple case, I think it might have damaged the iPad with how hard it was hit by something metal. So I breathed a sigh of relief. It could not have been better timed.I like the magnetic tab closure. That works very well. Though, at some viewing angles, it does seem to get in the way of the screen. Just play around with it to get it out of the way.I like how you can angle the iPad and use this as a stand. I only get landscape mode that way, but that works great for taking notes and things. I do wish it had a way to hold this in portrat mode... that would come in handy on several occasions. the Apple case didn't offer this either.Is it perfect? No. The magnetic tab does get in the way sometimes. And this adds significant thickness to the iPad. But, it is very well protected and holds the iPad with zero fear of it falling out. For that alone, I use this exclusively. I'm not even sure where the Apple cover is. And at $20, it is well priced, too!Oh, I guess I should mention, this does not turn on when you open the case, like the iPad Mini does. That isn't a feature I was dead set for, but many people prefer that feature. If you want that, then stay away from this. If you want a protector that keeps this thin, then stay with the Apple case. But for protection, this is pretty unbeatable.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009T0NIXS" id="B009T0NIXS-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-29:</strong> Right off the bat, if you really adore the slim sleek profile of your iPad Mini and don't want to sacrifice the slim look, stop reading and go buy a smart cover or something else super slim.  This is a tad bulky in comparison to some of the other iPad Mini cases.  Compared to other Belkin cases, it's only a fraction of an inch thicker than the Belkin Classic Tab case.  This is exactly what I wanted, a sturdy protective case that will adequately protect the Mini during transport and storage.  Yes, as noted, it is quite thick compared to other (non-Belkin) cases, especially if compared to the Smart Cover and it will make your iPad Mini pretty much resemble a small day planner in size and heft.  Although it does add several ounces of additional weight, I don't find that it makes the Mini any harder to hold for any duration of time.  It has a very secure magnetic closure that doesn't easily snap open.  Inside is completely padded with soft microfiber material except for the four TPU corners and border outline for the bracket to hold your iPad. You easily slip your iPad into the brackets and it fits securely without being overly snug.  It has three slots for viewing the iPad in landscape mode, however, they are more guides than actual holding grooves because they don't really hold the edge but the iPad does stay secure in landscape mode.  The case is very stylish and attractive.  It has a flat surface with a slightly raised quilt design pattern with a slight sheen.  The build and materials are top quality, and despite not being made of leather, have no feeling of cheapness at all.  About the only negative I can think of is the fact that it doesn't have the sleep/wake smart cover functionality.  Other than that missing feature, I love everything else about this case.  It  compliments my Mini nicely.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009T0NIXS" id="B009T0NIXS-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-27:</strong> The thing you love about the iPad mini is how small and compact it is.

I got the black one, and it fits in my hand like a small clutch purse.The iPad is completely protected, yet the cover adds no discernable weight or volume. I have dayplanners that are way bulkier (and heavier) than this, and not nearly as nice.The quilted cover over your iPad mini provides the perfect experience.

You can't go wrong stylistically with basic black! It is constructed from quality materials, looks good, feels great in the hand, is easy to clean, and when closed protects the iPad efficiently from accidental drops. The cut-out for the camera is well placed. None of the ports, speakers, audio or other buttons are blocked. The rubbery snap in corners hold the iPad securely. The cover can be folded back and held by the little magnetic latch when hand-held, and it props up nicely at a variety of angles horizontally, though not well vertically. The stitching and trim could use some slight refinement, but there is nothing really to complain about overall.My one big beef is that when you close the cover, there is no magnetic strip that puts the iPad into Sleep mode (Smart cover). I have another case that is about half the price (with a pen/stylus included!) and offers this feature, which I find essential for a number of applications. Other users may not care about it, but I consider it an must-have feature.Otherwise, I can't find much not to like about Belkin's black quilted cover for the iPad mini. If you don't think you'd make use of a cover's Smart Sleep feature, then I'd recommend it without hesitation. I'll likely continue using my other cover however.~ Kort</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009T0NIXS" id="B009T0NIXS-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-28:</strong> I was very impressed with this Belkin cover.

The Belkin Quilted Cover is a great cover for this device.  Quilted usually denotes padded, comfy and not professional, but the Belkin material -- a type of pseudo leather with tight stitching make this a cover ready made for the board room as well as your night stand.The cover is thick, but it does not make the iPad mini bulky in a briefcase or bag.The 'landscape' stand mode works well providing a stable stand for the iPad mini for watching videos or viewing a document.The cover closes easily and the magnetic cover lock secures the cover and protects the iPad mini-screen.The one thing that detracts from the cover is the observation that closing the cover does not put the iPad into sleep mode, which may leave the iPad mini 'on' longer than wanted.Overall, the cover is a great compliment to the iPad mini, providing protection, increasing its usability all without negating the mini's size and weight advantages.A recommended addition to you mini.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009T0NIXS" id="B009T0NIXS-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-04:</strong> I have owned several different case designs over the years.For Maximum protection I would go with an Otterbox or Lifeproof.For bare minimum I would look at Amazon Essentials Cases that are very affordable.I like a light weight yet somewhat protective case that looks good. This one fits that to the Tee. It's just a tad wider and taller than the iPad mini. You snap the iPad into a plastic cradle that is part of the back cover. It is hinged and allows you to set the horizontal viewing angle of the iPad based on which of 3 notches you choose. The interior is a velvety suede type material that seems easy to wipe clean. The outer material is a quilted pattern of material that looks like synthetic tight grain leather. The front cover clasps closed with a magnetic latch. There are no built-in magnets in the cover to sleep and wake the iPad. The only slight imperfection in the case seems to be the rear camera hole that has slightly rough edges to it. Some type of rubber grommet would have been nice to finish off the drilled hole.Overall I have to give this case 5 stars based on build quality, convenience, ease of use and style.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009T0NIXS" id="B009T0NIXS-review21" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-08:</strong> I really love the quilted black cover!

The screen is so amazing that it honestly hurt my eyes a little for the first hour or so (in the same way that a new glasses prescription hurts - your brain is getting so much more visual information than it's used to, so it needs a minute to adjust). As a teacher, one of my favorite features is S-Beam. S-Beam allows you to send a file to another Samsung phone, just by tapping the two phones back-to-back. When I need to give each of my students a copy of a handout, I no longer need to print one for each student. I print copies for those without Samsungs, but for those students who have Samsungs, I just walk around the room and &#34;bump&#34; the file to each of them.In case anyone reading this has read that sometimes when you order a phone online, what arrives is a knockoff, I will say that when I got my phone, I checked all of the tell tale signs for knockoff S4's and the phone I received is definitely authentic.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CIF9MJK" id="B00CIF9MJK-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-03:</strong> Got it on time  and of course LOOOVE the the phone itself , Works just perfect and i hope there will be no issues with it .

Here's what I like about the phone:Beautiful screen - for those of us who don't have perfect vision, this screen is very readable. The fonts are an appropriate size, with good contrast.Nice speed. The screen is responsive, and allows multiple windows to be open at once.Screen size:  For certain apps, I.e. the kindle app, this screen approximates an e-reader very well (as opposed to reading on a smaller phone screen.)The interface is very thoughtfully designed.  Great job, Samsung!  Unobtrusive, noninvasive methods of accessing critical apps are available from almost anyplace on the phone.Icons/graphics are adorable, and creatively designed.  No boring manila folders on this phone!  Your folders show contents from the outside of the folder... Cute.Ease of use:  There is a little bit of a learning curve on this phone (I had the Samsung Epic previously), but I've pretty much figured it out in a few hours.  It's going to be great. Once you get the hang of the graphics, it's really quick to move things around, personalize, etc.It really blurs the boundary between a tablet and a phone, without becoming too huge, like the Note (which I am now glad I did not buy).Voice quality: I'd read reviews in the last few days that state that it is not very good... I think it's fine. The sound is clear, and volume is fine.One of my favorite apps for Android:  Out of Milk.  Running out of groceries?  Scan the bar code into one of your shopping lists, (or input by voice or typing), and your shopping list is complete.  I keep a running shopping list for Trader Joes, and my other local market.  When I go to the store, I simply move the items I need to the top of the list, and go for it!  No more paper lists!One heads up: (carrier, not phone related):  check on Visual Voicemail.... I use it all the time, and really like it.  I was surprised to discover that I had to pay for it as an add on with Verizon.... It was part of my Sprint service previously.** UPDATE **I've had the phone for almost a week, and it's simply a PLEASURE to use!  Lots of nice touches:  pop up asking if you'd like to add someone to your contacts after a call from a non contact, for example.Camera:  is great.  I photographed an entire exhibit in a museum.... No flash, in dark rooms, and the photos are stunning.Battery life:  surprisingly good!  I used the phone all day yesterday, on and off trains where it would have been seeking service in tunnels (usually drains battery quicker), used my Kindle app, made calls, sent texts and emails, and I still had 60% at the end of a ten hour day.Battery recharging:  using the charging cord that comes with the phone, it charges in no time... A couple of hours at most.  I've been amazed at the recharge speed, compared to my previous phone.Kindle app is like a baby Kindle... there's just enough on the page to not feel like you are only reading a few sentences at a time like on some smaller devices.I'm so pleased with my choice,  I hope you enjoy it, also.(And in case this is helpful to anyone:  if you are debating about a case, I have the Seidio holster case... Please see my review.)*************Enjoy this great device!  Questions?  Drop a note, and I'll get back to you.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CIF9MJK" id="B00CIF9MJK-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-22:</strong> My daughter loved her Christmas present this year.

You may even ask yourself can it withstand the drops and the falls as well as all the bending it will foresee as you attach it to your phone.  What is the good?  Well, it's attractive once snapped onto your phone.  It provides a nice durable cover of protection.  All your ports are easily accessible and it does not get in the way of any of your buttons.  It's light weight and will not boggle down the functionality of the buttons nor block any of your external plug-ins.  The pattern design is a great look to any wardrobe.  What is the bad? Your buttons and ports do not have any covering and could result in liquid and/or water like substances getting into the buttons or on the side lines of your phone. It isn't designed for heavy duty protection.  I'm not sure how much of a fall your phone could actually take-Once hitting a hard surface, it may crack or break your phone in some capacity. What is the bottom line? It's affordable protection that allows for some flexibility and light protection.  It's a great fit for anyone with the need for a bendable but protective case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00ALR3P0Y" id="B00ALR3P0Y-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-14:</strong> I really like the look of this case, and it doesn't add a lot of bulk.

I like this product in that it is a semi-hard cased for protection.  However I am semi warm to the design of the case.  Some may find it hard to handle vs a cover with a hard back and soft sides, but this unit gives me the confidence it will hand not only a light impact, but it questionable about a heavy impact as well to the back of the phone.  Even though the back is semi-hard, the movement that covers the phone is semi-soft and easy to handle.  So you can grip and feel it easily.  It is made of polycarbonate material and the design should keep the front of the phone from getting scratches.  It has ports for using a headset hookup and charger hookup and other periferals to plug into the phone.  I am not really pleased with the design, because the phone will snap into the case securely on the top and the bottom, but leaves the sides exposed and not as well protected from impact. I like the black color, and is especially good for businesmen, since black indicates power and is a traditional color.  I just feel a cover with deeper protection on the sides would stand impact much better.  Anymode is the company who markets the product and they have an excellent reputation for solid quality products that last.  The price of $19.95 is excellent for the product, but this would not be my first pick for a protective case for my phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00ALR3P0Y', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00ALR3P0Y', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B004FE39NW</h2>    <p class="price"> $B004FE39NW</p>    <p></p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004FE39NW" id="B004FE39NW-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-20:</strong> This holster is very cheap and the plastic clips that holds the phone in place breaks easily.

A bit on the tight side but will break in over time.  Mine actually wasn't too tight with my 4S.  I love the quality of the sleeve with a nice top grain leather (or at least top grain leather look, hard to say for sure).  The pull tab is easy to work, and magnetic so it stays flat.There is one critical thing to note, if you hold your phone up against the sleeve to use, you might see a black screen with only a clock on it and the phone won't wake up.  This is because of the magnet in the case for the pull tab.  Reposition the phone and it will work fine.  It took me forever to figure out this case was causing my issue.  It is because of a feature in the phone with a special case you can turn on just the clock to see through the clear window in the Samsung case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009K184TO" id="B009K184TO-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-09:</strong> I was very impressed with this case when it arrived.

I am therefore doubly disappointed with this purchase of the defender series for Note 3. The holster locks the phone in by clipping over a little recess on the part of the case which covers the device itself. The problem which develops is that the recess itself breaks quickly meaning that the phone will no longer stay in the holster. This appears to be a major design flaw because both of my recesses have now broken and the holster has been rendered completely useless. In my opinion the holster is an integral part of the defender experience and offers some additional protection as well. This flaw makes the defender less than what Otterbox claims. I'm still intending to use the case without the holster, but the damage is unattractive and to be quite honest annoying. The defender series usually offers superior protection to that afforded by the commuter series and to other cases imo, but if having a functioning holster is also a requirement (given the fact that it doubles as a device stand) then I'd skip this and look elsewhere. I hope to get a replacement case from Otterbox, but that isn't looking likely so I'm just sticking with it while I research other options. Disappointing from Otterbox smh.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F9VRNF0" id="B00F9VRNF0-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-01:</strong> I've used many Otter cases over the years for various phones and PDAs.

I have always purchased other less expensive cases but felt the need to try OTTERBOX for my NOTE 3. It was very easy to put on and fits to a tee. IT ACTUALLY MAKES IT EASIER TO REMOVE THE S-PEN. I don't like using the holster on belt or waist because it tends to fall off easy. The phone does fit in holster either way to use as a stand and have it sit on desk. The holster clip also makes it easier to hold the phone. Only complaint was the availability in colors.

It does add bulk but, for such a large phone its not that bad. Every thing is covered,  the home button,  charging connector all have sturdy flaps to keep dirt and debris out; yet everything that needs to be exposed is. The mic, speakers, cameras have perfectly placed openings.  The power and volume buttons are easy and comfortable to use. There is a plastic cover over the screen that I was worried about,  but it works fine, even with the skin screen protector I already had on. There are three parts of the main cover,  the front plastic I mentioned, a rear plastic cover that has a thin soft padding, and the rubber that covers the back, sides, and all the openings.  If you carry extra batteries,  like I do, this case is tough to get off and back on.The separate plastic holster doubles as a stand. You can put the phone in either side,  there are notches that snap the phone into the holster. On the back,  the belt clip turns (rotates) so you can carry the phone either landscape or portrait.  When using it as a stand the phone sits in the bottom corner holders and rests nicely against the back. The viewing angle is not adjustable but it is comfortable. I can set it on my night stand,  plugged into the charger,  and read or view my clock.It seems to offer great protection. The rubber back cover wraps around the front and is raised around the screen for additional front protection. But you do sacrifice the thin, light beauty of the phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F9VRNF0" id="B00F9VRNF0-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-22:</strong> OttorBox produces five product series of four levels of protection. They are Armor, Defender, Commuter, and Relfex/Prefix, with descending level of protection and physical bulk.Compared to the Armor series, the Defender does not protect against water splash nor crushing force, but it is definitely much less bulky.This series also includes a holster, so that the phone can be carried on the outside of body for convenience. For screen protection, it is best to attach the phone to the holster with the screen facing in.Not even the Armor series will protect against forces applied to the glass screen, such as dropping a wrench or hammer onto it. Therefore, it is always a good habit to lay the phone face down when not used.The Defender series does really well in terms of protection against drop and dust.Although I think it is excellent for work environments like construction and package/document delivery service, if your use involves rougher than normal handling of the phone, the Defender is a must.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F9VRNF0" id="B00F9VRNF0-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-24:</strong> Short Summary: This case is good, but at this price, probably go for Zerolemon case + the 10000mAh batteryMaterial Constructions:This case is similar to the Galaxy S3 case that I have.  It is quick sturdy and can take a good fall. It uses plastic rubber for the outer shell and hard plastic for the inside.  A screen protector is included but I prefer my own so I popped it out.  The outer shell at higher temperature feels a bit sticky.  I'm not sure if it is melting from my radiator heat but feels like the analog buttons on my ps3 controllers at high temperatureSize:It feels slightly slimmer than other Otterbox cases of this size (I was checking out my friend's note 2 case) so it can be less protective.Price:I got this at 59.99 USD which is quite expensive when you compare to other cases out there.  However, it was the only rugged case out at the time I got this so it is ok for me.Compare  to other products out there:There are some other products out there which is better bang for the bucks when compare to this case.- Zerolemon has a rugged case with a 10000mAh battery at the same price I got this case at.  Every way that case is equally or if not, better than the otterbox. Additionally there is a massive 10000mAh battery which you can choose to use or not use.- i-Blason has a rugged case for less but quality is questionable (which is in my other review)Overall: 6/10- It is a good case overall and does provide the protection you are looking for.  However, the price really kills this deal when there are other products just as good as this for less or provide more bang for the buck</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F9VRNF0" id="B00F9VRNF0-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-13:</strong> Very durable as they are.

I am used to having so many choices of cases to pick from and have used Trident Kraken cases for my Galaxy S3 and the Samsung Vibrant. When I switched to my Note 3, I was disappointed in the Trident Kraken case for the Note 3 and other choices of cases out there. I purchased the Otterbox Defender as my 1st case for my note 3 because I liked the look of it and was familiar with them from friends that have Otterboxes and by reading reviews. This is hands down the best case you can buy if you are looking for protection. I have purchased two Trident Kraken cases and they don't compare to the build quality and materials of Otterbox. My only Gripe with this case is the built-in screen protector isn't the greatest so I removed it and installed the Spigen Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Screen Protector Glass [GLAS.tR SLIM]. with the Otterbox Defender on it. It fits!!! It did make the phone a bit more heavier, but the clarity is great! I feel this is the best combo. Glass screen protector from speigen and Otterbox defender is the way to go. The case fits perfectly on the phone with the glass screen protector on it. It feels like I don't have a screen protector on. Every thing is super clear and the touch is smooth. This is way better than the Zagg HD. It works great with the S pen and doesn't leave those annoying marks. The case comes with a belt holster that has a hook on it so it won't come off of your belt and it clips in very securely so you don't have to worry about losing your phone. Recommend the Otterbox Defender series to anyone who wants superior protection for your phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F9VRNF0" id="B00F9VRNF0-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-28:</strong> I love OtterBox cases.

I ordered it after my niece leaped on to me and accidently kicked my phone off of my hip (with a belt clip) causing the phone to hit the ground and separating the screen and adhesive from the face of the phone just a bit.  The phone operates perfectly but the incident got me thinking about the cost of the phone and how much cheaper it is to simply have a great case.  My dad has the same case for his GS5 and he really likes the durability of the phone as well.  All things considered, I decided to make the move and order the phone from Amazon and had the case 2 days later (I have Amazon Prime and love it too)!  I have since dropped the phone but not worried about the impact because of the Otterbox protection.  It is great.  I may get another case just to have another color.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F9VRNF0" id="B00F9VRNF0-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-09:</strong> Excellent protection.

This case is a definite must have for anyone who is serious about protecting their Galaxy Note 3.Nowadays it's hard to find case manufacturers and by that I mean companies that actually manufacture new original cases, most name brands out there only slap on a label with their logo on random generic cases. You can tell that OtterBox actually puts some time into developing a new product and that their cases are designed and built out of scratch.This case is beautifully designed, it does add a little bulk to the phone but I think it's a small price to pay for the protection that you get. The clip feels firm and strong, looks like it will last longer than the actual phone. I have not done any drop tests so I can't tell you for sure how far you can push this case but I'm sure it will protect it from accidental drops from at least 5 feet high.I highly recommend this case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F9VRNF0" id="B00F9VRNF0-review24" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-16:</strong> This was purchased for my husband's Note 3.  We've been through several cases before finally biting the bullet with the Otterbox.  It feels like it's providing good protection.  Installation was easy and I like that it covers the ports, although the charging port is very stiff and puts pressure on the cable, which I don't like.  it doesn't stay in the holster very well while he works (construction), so he can't use it.  Also, he has a tempered glass screen protector that works great on its own, but with the Otterbox screen cover, touch sensitivity is greatly reduced.  Because he's already dropped one phone, we don't want to remove the glass protector, and it doesn't look like we can use this case without the cover, so he just muddles through with it.  As long as his phone is protected, he's willing to deal.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F9VRNF0" id="B00F9VRNF0-review25" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-11:</strong> ... I just can't give this a higher review until my Note hits the floor.It's an OtterBox. It substantially adds to the size of your electronic device with the promise that when, not if but when, your toddler lets that bad boy hit the concrete, it will have a good chance of surviving. So, until that moment that incites existential dread, that mysterium tremendum, when my device goes tumbling through the air with me flailing after, that promise goes untested. When it does, I'll be able to give this higher stars if my device survives.What I CAN say about it is that it takes a really long time to get the thing open and to get my device inside. Not sure whether that is an intended effect or whether I'm just an idiot, but it was pretty frustrating.

There's a space between the screen and the protector, so you can see a lot of rainbow-like colors. And also, not such a quality material, so I can see that in a few month it'll be uselless.For a 700+ dollars phone, you will probably want a top nocht case. For a great protection, I removed the screen that came with the case, and installed a tempered glass to my phone.

I am used to having so many choices of cases to pick from and have tried many cases for my iPhone. When I switched to my Note 3 a few weeks ago, I was disappointed in the choices of cases out there. I purchased the Otterbox Defender as my 1st case for my note 3 because I was familiar with them. This is hands down the best case you can buy if you are looking for protection. I have purchased several other cases from mall kiosks and online and none of them compare to the build quality and materials of Otterbox.  My only Gripe with this case is the same issues I experienced with my pervious Defender cases, the built-in screen protector isn't the greatest.Like I have done with all my other defender cases, I removed the screen protector because it degrades the quality of the screen. I ended up putting a Zagg HD on my Note 3, but I will soon replace it because it doesn't hold up well against the s pen. I plan on replacing my screen protector with a Speigen Glass screen protector soon. I am worried if the otterbox will fit with a glass protector on the Note 3. I will try it in the next few days and attempt to update this review.Other than the issues I have with the screen, this is a great case for the best protection. The belt clip is a little hard to get on and off, but I like that because it feels very secure.UPDATE: 12/12/2013I got my speigen glass screen protector and installed it with the otterbox defender on it. It fits!!! It did make the phone a bit more heavier, but the clarity is great! I feel this is the best combo.  Glass screen protector from speigen and Otterbox defender is the way to go. The case fits perfectly on the phone with the glass screen protector on it. It feels like I don't have a screen protector on. Every thing is super clear and the touch is smooth. This is way better than the Zagg HD. It works great with the S pen and doesn't leave those annoying marks.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F9VRNF0" id="B00F9VRNF0-review38" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-19:</strong> My husband is loving his case because it is protecting his phone from any damage.

I'm absolutely sold.- The size isn't a problem since the phone itself is so much larger than my previous phones.  Either in my hand, or holding it to my ear, it was already big, so the extra bulk, though obviously noticeable, isn't an issue for me at all.- The near complete encasement of the phone is the most important factor in my purchase of this case, and it delivers in that regard.  I have a 9 yr old and a 2 yr old, and they can drop it (which they have), put their sticky fingers all over it (which they have), and it all stays on the outside, along with scratches and whatever else.  The dust accumulation that builds up in openings on previous cases is also not present using this case.- I simply left my glass protector on and also used the included facing that came with the OtterBox, really just because I wasn't sure how the OtterBox would work and didn't want to reinstall the other screen protector if it didn't work out... but everything still works perfectly with essentially two screen protectors.  Touch sensitivity is fine, no glare, no &#34;rainbows&#34;, and I probably won't worry about removing the old one.- One thing I'm not sure is if they sell just the front Otterbox screen protector seperate if this one starts getting scratched up, I'll have to check that out.  Again, I like the entire front integration, so I hope I can get the front &#34;frame&#34; + screen protector without buying the whole 3-layer case again.- The belt clip is sturdy, almost too much so... I typically have to use two hands to remove the phone from the holder.  I can release the phone with one hand if I try hard enough, but it's not a quick and easy release, it takes a lot of pressure.  That at least tells me it's solidly attached and I'm OK with being aggressive with it.  : )- The &#34;stand&#34; is actually the belt clip.  I wish the cover itself had a built in stand because sometimes I have the phone in a pocket and without the belt clip I have no way to stand it up.  That's my only minor complaint.All - in - all it's the best case I've ever had and I'm more than satisfied.Highly recommended.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F9VRNF0" id="B00F9VRNF0-review42" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-13:</strong> This otter box defender case works great.

You also don't &#34;pop&#34; your phone in this - it is a decent installation to get your device in this case. You first remove the rubber jacket from the hard shell, then split the shell, then do it all in reverse. You'll need a good 4 to 5 minutes for a good installation.Once in the case, you can click it in the included holster - which works as a belt clip or as a (movie) viewing stand when you pull the belt clip open.There are flaps for the charger port and the headphone jack. It will NOT work with wireless charging. The Samsung charger back is too thick, and the Qi charger accessories that you put behind the original back don't get a good enough signal to work. I also found that NFC is harder to work with.There are openings in the front (for the speaker, LED indicator and camera), the top (for the microphone and IR port) rear (for the camera) and the bottom (for the second mix and speakers). This means it is definitely not a waterproof case, other than perhaps a few drips of rain.Still, with a $749 phone this case is the one investment that should/could keep it from falling apart.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F9VRNF0" id="B00F9VRNF0-review55" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-09:</strong> Legendary.  Not sure what else I am able to add to this review that hasn't been mentioned before?  I will mention thought that the case in white & grey is actually pretty stylish and is a noticeable improvement over there case for the S3.My father in law recently bought an iphone (dumb I know)! You should see the Otterbox for it, it's a brick!  A rectangular piece of thick plastic and he thinks its great (apple).The Otterbox for the Note 3 however is a lot more shapely than a dumb iphone. For example on the Otterbox the case is tapered around the back of the phone (rounded) it feels great in your hand is because of the outer rubber shell is next to imposable to drop or slip out of your hands.Another improvement is the rubber flaps covering the audio port and charging ports the flaps are is a lot easier to flip up when attaching headphones or the USB cable when it is time to charge the phone.Great case especially when you need the ultimate in protection.  Otterbox support is fantastic as well, recently I contacted Otterbox case when the rubber outer shell gets warped out of shape (due to taking it off many times).  Not happy about the thought of having to buy another $54.00+ case Otterbox simply asked for my info and shipped me out a new rubber outer shell free of charge.It's Otterbox, just buy it and be done with it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F9VRNF0" id="B00F9VRNF0-review56" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-21:</strong> There's no middle ground here folks.  This thing will turn your phone into a tank.  As if the Note 3 was not big enough, this basically triples the thickness and makes it about 20% bigger all around.  Despite this I have to say it still fits in my pockets.The out skin fits nicely around the inner plastic case and provides tenfold impact protection.  The phone feels about twice as heavy although it really isn't.. I think it's a mental thing.  It just feels like you could use it for self defense or something.I've dropped the phone over a dozen times since getting it, as I am notoriously clumsy with my phones (which was why I got it in the first place).. This is an $800 phone, there's no way in hell I'm buying a replacement.  This thing will pretty much guarantee I will never destroy my phone from a drop like before.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F9VRNF0" id="B00F9VRNF0-review57" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-29:</strong> I bought this as a gift for my uncle and he has yet to take it off his phone.

They protect from just about anything and keep my phone in great shape so it looks just like new when I'm ready to upgrade to a new phone. I always use a screen protector on my phone underneath the Otter box for added protection from particles that can slip inside the case through the speaker cutout at the top.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F9VRNF0" id="B00F9VRNF0-review59" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-13:</strong> I really like this case, Otterbox always seems to knock it out of the park with phone protection.

The case is nice and tight and does not add nearly as much bulk as I was expecting it to.  One word of advice as a past otterbox user.is to put a screen protector on your device BEFORE you put the otterbox on.  I have had screens damaged by dust and small things getting inside my otterbox and the getting behind the built in screen protector.  My only complaint is that at this price point, I should be able to get better color choices for my white phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F9VRNF0" id="B00F9VRNF0-review62" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-13:</strong> This is a little big and a little heavy but great case.  it secures my Note 3 all around with plug for power and phone inputs.

The case itself does offer great protection, but it's also a little slick in the hand without any type of grip on the sides and isn't the most attractive case on the market - neither though, would lead me to returning the case.  The ability for me to holster my phone on my belt, on the other hand, is paramount to me and that's where the issue was.  It may have been just my case, but when I snapped the phone into the holster, it would click as it should, but with the slightest pressure, it would pop right out of the clip.  This meant, that whenever I bumped into something slightly, my phone would pop off of the clip.  Now, I was lucky enough to catch the phone before it hit the floor each time that it did this, but this is the complete opposite of why I spent the extra money in the first place on this and after that, I had absolutely zero confidence that my precious Note 3 was going to be safe going forward.  I'm about to return this case and have already bought another holster case to replace it.  I bought the Seidio case/holster combo (their highest protection case - forgot the name) and absolutely love it!  The case itself is ok, but has a design flaw that is well documented online, but the holster is top-notch and includes a spring-loaded clip to keep my phone (in a different case) secure on my belt.  Again, the Otterbox case offers fantastic protection, but the holster wasn't secure enough for me.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F9VRNF0" id="B00F9VRNF0-review64" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-14:</strong> You can't ever go wrong with an OtterBox Defender. They fit perfectly and offer great protection for your device. My only complaint about them is that removing your battery can be a chore, but if the case was easy to remove then it would probably offer less protection. I bought a Defender for my new Galaxy Note 3 and my iPod Touch 5th Gen and I really like the look, fit and feel on both devices. Five stars all the way.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F9VRNF0" id="B00F9VRNF0-review65" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-13:</strong> Thankfully I bought this case at the same time I bought the phone. Since this phone is larger in all three dimensions (WxHxD) than any phone I have had previously, the first few weeks I dropped it quite a bit trying to get used to it. The case has kept it ticking. Although is going to protect from a direct impact to the screen, the built in screen protector has kept it from getting scratched on a few of those falls.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F9VRNF0" id="B00F9VRNF0-review66" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-11:</strong> For my former phones dating back to a blackberry, I've always purchased the Seidio Surface cases and holsters which served perfectly.  Since I graduated to a Note 3, I thought I might make the investment into the Defender case and holster combo.  This is the first integrated screen protector case combo I've owned and while it works well, changing out batteries with spares is too cumbersome.  Just as normal screen protectors are tricky to install getting the dust particles off just long enough to install, this case is no different.  I'm sure everyone dreads replacing the screen protector...now i have to do it with every batter swap.The holster, on the other hand, is a royal pain as it requires two hands to properly secure and disengage.  I would not purchase a defender case with this holster again.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00F9VRNF0', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00F9VRNF0', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li>
